young young it's like the model silly about North Korea when you have to be [Music] that was the first one to visit all the officially allowed locations for foreigners the the downside was I had to present everything to Pyongyang and they had to approve everything I allowed that I said yes because otherwise you don't have anything I was there for 60 days which is a lot for you know foreigner you have to go to the very few hotels that are reserved for foreigners and and of course he cannot leave the hotel at any time the soldiers outside I cannot even leave the hotel just to take a breath of air or whatever so you always followed day and night and very often I was staying in hotels all by myself my guides were sleeping left and right and in rooms next to me so I whenever I opened my door to you know walk around the hotel by accident the two doors opened as well so are we going out yes we're going out ourselves but to be honest I like that you know it's like being embedded or something I checked almost all my hotel rooms for microphones and hidden video cameras and so so I did try to you know unscrew the bulbs and to see whatever was happening behind my mirror in my bathroom where I never found anything that's always the first thing you visit us as a tourist or a visitor you have to go there and buy flowers then you have to go through the two statues of the leaders and bow and put the flowers in front of them one of the rules also was when you take pictures of any statue or monument with the leaders involved even paintings or portraits you have you cannot crop if you have to you know show everything the head to feet the arms so and this time there were a little bit in a mist my guide was not sure if it was okay to take pictures of the statues in the mist but you know and when there's a lot of limitations I like it because you you know we have you have to have more creativity and you have to you know work harder to make good pictures this is the the new science museum when they arrive they have to pay allegiance to the leaders of course this picture you see one looking at me in a whole crowd of like maybe two hundred young young children in their pioneer dresses you know the communist youth dresses they have to wear when they go to school so and and something that's very typical for North Korea if you stayed there for a week almost every day you have to go to school well where the children are performing for you I think they had to train a very long time to do all these performances for tourists but it's usually a group of tourists they sit there and there's a bit of ballet they're singing and so on usually very nice and but I was all by myself and I was feeling you know was feeling a little bit awkward sometimes that these young young young children this is one of the very few pictures I took from the minibus but it's one of the very few images of a real harvest in North Korea the driver also he yes he had to go to places where he had never gone before so we had to ask in all directions every time that's why I'm pretty sure that I have seen places villages landscape that nobody has ever seen before because the driver just took a wrong turn every time so he was always lost the swimming pool is an older health complex dates back from the Soviet time actually it's something you still find in Moscow these very old beautiful swimming pools with mosaics and beautiful paintings and propaganda type posters and so on and so in there that case that that swimming pool was wonderful people swimming you know in a dream I mean have to consider my work like like a movie or a novel not like something politically correct or totally 100 percent documentary objective and so on I like you know playing with both fiction but it's reality it happens in front of my camera but of course as a photographer he can now change things along you know along the way as well so there's a bit of exaggeration here and there this you know combination of images forces people to think about the subject I'm photographing this is real is not real is his fantasy this propaganda and things like that it's like you're swimming into a new environment and you see things along the way you know and and you make up your mind you
