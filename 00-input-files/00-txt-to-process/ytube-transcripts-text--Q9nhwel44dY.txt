the north korean army's goal is not actually going to work with other countries not even defending themselves foreign invasion the military was designed to deal with kutata but the only sad thing is that kim jong has a son his first son was born in 2009 so if kim jong un be alive another 10 years that's not gonna be 22 years old then that person can definitely take over north korea what kim jong did [Music] hi everyone welcome to my channel my name is amy park i am a north korean factory human rights activist so one of the most requested subject has been what is the future of north korea what would be the scenario that kim jong-un goes away and people become free so today i'm going to finally cover that subject in this video in depth so please stay till the end and hit that like button before you go into deeper so we all want to see freedom in north korea right how wonderful would that be seeing 25 million people liberated by a dictator who is mercilessly ruling people and enslaved these people for 80 years right now we all want that and that's why i'm going to this door experiment with you after i've been studying north korea so many years of my life i lived there i'm a north korean therefore i really hope that my insights can help you to understand the future of north korea a bit better i think in order to change it to happen it's going to be a huge big category number one is internal change the change coming from within north korea the second one is going to be external change the change can come from the countries like the usa china japan you know south korea the number one internally we are looking at north korea there is a huge four categories that can bring change in north korea number one is going to be uprising number two is going to be a coup d'etat from the military number three is going to be assassins killing someone killing kim jong last one is kim jong-un dies on his own due to health reasons so let's go look at the first one the the revolution the uprising in north korea change coming from revolution by the people is unfortunately highly unlikely because north korea so i think it's gonna be in few days we saw the tenant and the chinese uprising under the communist party and we saw how even these students were occupying this the beijing their capital of china when the regime went with tanks and killing them all they would not be able to successful we are talking about different brutality we are talking about different cruelty north korean regime is the only country does not allow even one distance inside the country there is no decent in north korea because the regime has zero tolerance for anybody to to revolt and does not disagree with the region if his and my hometown or hamon won some major cities of rights to demand freedom right they're gonna go on street and start the demonstration if that happens kim jong-un going to seize the entire city and gonna bring on machine guns and kill literally every single one of them but do you know what's gonna happen the international community gonna do nothing about it we're gonna watch and we most likely in north korea there is not even internet really nobody at the moment when that happens the only chance that uprising can happen is when congen the characterizes but the problem why the capital is not gonna rise is because kim jong has been investing all his resources to make that people who are having the good family background who are actually loyal to the socialism the north korean regime he's been calling cleansing pyongyang with the people since the 1970s the regime dedicated to bring every lawyer person to pyongyang who believe in this ideology and also give them the resources giving the infrastructure free housing free health care free education and please this illegitim pyongyang if the pyongyang rise something definitely can happen to kim jong-un but that chance is very very low now let's go back to second reason the coup d'etat by the military so north korea is the fourth largest army in the world given the population and the poverty gdp it makes no sense why does this tiny country cannot feed citizens in this 21st century having this large army the north korean army's goal is not actually going to work with other countries not even defending themselves foreign invasion the military was designed to deal with kuteka that is what it is the north korean is over 1.6 million soldiers designed to stop the kutata the system designed that when the even uh the top generator said let's let's go to like march into pyongyang they have so many spies and different network they can never gather that uh unity from the entire soldiers but the other problem is that kim jong-un switches internal cabinet when it comes especially the military every three years after you're being in charge of the top military as a general you get either assassinated or publicly executed or sent a prison camp that's how kim jong prevents of these top soldiers consolidating their power in order to start a coup d'etat you gotta develop a relationship you gotta find who is your ally you gotta get to know them you gotta plan it you gotta get on weapons and soldiers it takes time to start a kutata and that's how kim jong prevents it by getting rid of these generals and leaders constantly constantly getting rid of them so nobody can consolidate power so unfortunately kutata is also unlikely the third one assassination of kim jong-un i still know that u.s has every capability to assassinate but they just don't do it because they don't see the benefit of doing it right now then that means north korean us we have to start thinking about assassinating kim jong-un it's impossible first of all because north korean leaders in their power almost 80 years nobody got assassinated that shows how good they are protecting the kim kim's right though literally nobody can go near kim jong with weapons in north korea people do not have the right to have own guns and nobody can have weapons only people can have weapons are the bodyguards but when they train these bodyguards to the degree of brainwashing is not just like making them read and make believe kim's or gods they even check the subconscious of these bodyguards that's how they're vigorously checking everybody that keeps kim jones safe is so so so insanely brainwashed that even in their sleep they're they're gonna give their body to protecting kims not only that when kim jong moves around inside the north korean country there are literally eight exact same cars and transportations go all together so first of all nobody knows which car team zone is in and eight of them all go to different directions and in each the the truth they got like at least like five to six cards in a row and constantly changing which card kim jong-un is in like that changing roles nobody can follow even though so internally like somebody know which diversion kingdom is going which car he was in but the drivers trained to change the lanes and making it super confusing so nobody knows which car he's exactly kim jong never traveled with anybody so even when he goes parties and important meetings the top elites fly there first and kim jong-un shows up nobody knows kim jong-un flew there or took a train or took a car or took a boat that's how secretive it is that nobody knows kim jong-un's where abouts so assassination is also almost impossible last one is death of kim jong-un youth due to health reasons i have a lot of hope for this one and a lot of other skin experts also hopeful of that kim jong-un right now is over 300 pounds over 150 kilograms he gained weight rapidly when he came into power in 2012 he wasn't this big less than 10 years of time he gained this immense weight and he's known to be drinking and eating really greasy oily food he has no controversy how much he eats how much he drinks he has a very low self-control and he's already known to have a breathing problems he have diabetes he's he can't even walk that straight at like at that young age he's like only in his 30s but the only sad thing is that kim jong has a son his first son was born in 2009 so if kim jong b alive another 10 years that's not gonna be 22 years old then that person can definitely take over north korea what kim jong did so right now currently kim jong's goal is living another 10 years so until his son is ready to take it over and that will be considered as a successful reign of kim jong-un i really hope that kim jong-un doesn't live another 10 years i really hope so anything can happen and if there's god i pray every single day that he wouldn't live that long so let's go back to the last external force that can change north korea it's going to be war or invasion if the usa or south korea japan wanted to invade north korea they would already have but they haven't it's because they came to the conclusion that it's not benefiting them starting a war against north korea south korea of course there is a huge dream for the soul to be invaded by north korea even though they win the world eventually they got a lot of sacrifice u.s also thinks it's too much work for them and they don't after iraq they really learn a lesson they don't want to go invade the country and not knowing what aftermath gonna look like there's a lot of fear on that so it seems like north korea will never start the war against any country because all kim jong-un wants is enslaving 25 millions of people and be of god in this 21st century that's all he wants be the kingdom with having his continuing the kingdom of his family and south korea's intention is also the same they don't care that 25 million people are oppressed in the north all they care is their safety they want to maintain the status quo so south korea will never invade north korea why japan know the way the china has been being north korea japan will not invade north korea even though the north korea's missile threats is directly affecting japanese security therefore in a way kim jong is in a perfect spot he got no foreign invasion no threat from the externally all he needs now here is his own his body on his self-worth to stay healthy and maintaining his anger and live as long as he can at least 10 years then his son isn't taken over it is sad that how still the regime seems so strong and how much no threat is posing to kim jong-un but the thing is because we know what is a strong point for kim jong-un what is the weakness for him we can a target and how to bring nan kim jong so i will next time i will cover what can be helpful to bring down kim jong and freeing north korean people i'm always grateful and i'm still very touched every single day that how much humanity is still alive and you guys care about north korean people suffering thank you guys for listening to my story listening to this video if you really care about freedom in north korea please help me
