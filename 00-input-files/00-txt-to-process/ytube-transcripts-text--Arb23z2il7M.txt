what's up slappers today we're gonna start a new exciting series called bass which stands for bass around the world epic we are gonna choose one country and discover and react to musicians and all the bassists of that country for example react to bases in the usa of america or italy or wakanda i think this can be a very cool series because i know a lot of you slappers are from all over the world so it's a cool way to do something together in the name of bass but the main reason why i'm doing this is so i can share with you so many cool bassists and then destroy them and become the only bassist in the world also at the end of the video we are gonna rate every country based on the amount of bass they have if we find a lot of basses cool and good but if they don't have bass it's okay nothing to be worried about we should bomb and destroy that country for this first episode i could choose an obvious country such as but we want a challenge so we're gonna choose one of the most obscure in secret countries north korea i know what you're thinking who cares about north korea you should be ashamed of yourself i treat all my fans equally in the past 10 years i got two views from north korea so this video is for you my two viewers from north korea slept like now if you are watching this video from north korea i expect at least two likes where i will be set but i only have one subscriber from north korea north korean viewer number two you disappointed me subscribe now anyway let's start the hardest part about north korea is that we don't know if they even have a base in the country do they even sell bases if not we should bomb them first musicians from north korea are they gonna be [Music] bases [Music] [Music] [Music] not the base but they're using a base technique on these guitars it's funny the guitars are bigger than them [Music] [Music] next [Music] [Music] [Music] not a bassist but some pretty intense and hard guitar playing these kids are very good at playing the guitar but they are not powerful enough for bass i could destroy them all with just one slap next not korean girl playing the piano let's see which instrument she's gonna play i hope it's bass [Applause] [Music] not a bassist gold skills bad instrument next video north korean kid playing violin is he gonna play the bass let's see seeing that violin reminded me of terrible times two set violin has been real quiet since this not korean violinist video [Music] dropped i'm here in some base maybe we found something [Music] omg finally a bassist [Music] at least we know there is one basis in north korea there was not enough for me too many violins i don't know about you but i've noticed something weird in these videos all the musicians are either kids or women where are all the men that means if i move to north korea i can be the strongest male bassist just kidding i'm already the strongest bassist in existence we are getting closer to base i can feel it pyongyang slapping base north korea [Music] those bass strings are old af feels like we can't find a good base video from north korea but luckily for you i prepared for this video and i think i found the video we were looking for the video i'm about to show you is extremely rare it was uploaded on youtube but it got deleted for no reason i spent months looking for it until one day i found it on facebook for once facebook pages actually turned out to be pretty useful so this is a base duo from north korea let's see how strong the base really is [Music] [Music] so [Music] omg they switched places unbelievable they are playing pretty average bass playing here i expected more from the only two north korean bassists so omg did you just see that mind-blowing techniques here this song sounds pretty good and it's some serious slap here and they didn't do it not happy [Music] [Applause] i just realized something shocking i think i know who these bases are they are my two viewers i talked about in the beginning i am proud of you you know what they got harmonies fingerstyle tap slap epic dance moves that was actually pretty good north korea might have only two bases but they are approved that's why they have to be stopped i'm just joking keep it up so it looks like we finally got what we were looking for i'm gonna give north korea a 2 out of 10 base rating because are literally just two bases in the country but they are pretty solid now i have a question for you which country should we review next brazil philippines us and a or another country leave a comment now and that was it for this first episode of bass i hope you enjoyed it and i will see you in the next video stay bald i mean stay funky bros oh
