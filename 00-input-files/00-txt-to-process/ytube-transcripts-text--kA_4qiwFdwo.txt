[Music] obviously the year 2019 is very important for china diplomatically for example china's diplomatic relationship with the dprk is moving into its eighth decade last weekend leaders from the two sides exchanged congratulations on its 70th anniversary so how has the relationship changed since the early days and the korean war in particular where does it stand today and what's the way forward to a nuclear-free korean peninsula to discuss these issues and more i'm very happy to be joined in the beijing studio by yang xiu senior fellow of the china institute of international studies we shall also speak with our satellite to soon young lee a kim kung korean foundation professor of korean studies at the fletcher school of law and diplomacy at tufts university in massachusetts and to peter kucinich professor of history and director of the nuclear studies institute at american university in washington well telephone that's our topic this is a dialogue i'm young ray [Music] welcome to dialogue professor yang many are watching out and they want to look at what message the chinese government will deliver on this very important occasion of the 70th anniversary between the dprk and china i mean what do you think is the most important message that we're going to deliver um about the friendship about our national stakes geopolitical rivalry cold war legacy of the cold war and the korean war above all so what do you think is the most important well multiple strategic messages but the most important thing as you asked is the new type of cooperation forward future based on the traditional history tradition and history history means from the wartime cold war era and the political era and the tradition is the friendship stem from the wartime through the cold war to now that extremes a lot of difficulties and challenges and opportunities and that's not what we want what we want is based on the history to strengthen the cooperation between the two sides for a joint uh efforts towards a durable peace and denuclearization of the peninsula which is which are two fundamental strategic goals of china say generalization and peace on the peninsula obviously it's an important issue for the chinese authorities to protect and maintain peace and stability in a neighborhood like the korean peninsula where we saw the outbreak of the very first bloody regional conflict in the week of the second world war obviously there are many many stories behind the roller coaster relationship quote unquote between ping jiang and beijing let me cross over to uh professor lee who's standing by in the united states for his comments on the very meaningful bilateral relationship because this year we witnessed the 70th anniversary between the dprk and beijing what are your thoughts well i think of the 14 neighbors that china has contiguously by land north korea has always been the most important certainly strategically the most important to china because of course historically korea-china relations predate the 20th century or the cold war they go back thousands of years and the people-to-people link between korea and china has been strong throughout history kim il-sung the north korea founder sent thousands of korean troops to fight alongside the chinese communist party in the chinese civil war so the relationship actually predates 1948 when the dprk north korea was founded or 1949 when the prc was founded and of course chairman mao's decision to send chinese troops to help the dprk in the korean war cemented that special relationship china literally saved the dprk from the brink of regime collapse and at the time china had several compelling reasons to take that risk of going to war against the united states i'll go back to the war the korean war that took place in 1950 let me challenge your your assertion that among all the 14 nations that share the land border with the prc the dprk is the most special but many in china would disagree with all respect for example uh since the doklam crisis president xi jinping has met with his indian prime minister modi many many times the landmark conference was of course the wuhan summit and very quickly seo in qingdao shenzhen province and president xi will soon visit india and nepal uh the two important countries in uh neighborhood in south asia so the bolder disputes between india and china since 1962 remain a top concern for politicians and international observers uh ever since why do you think dprk would replace india to become the most sensitive flash point diplomatically and due politically for china well there have been periods of ups and downs ebb and flow in bilateral relationship between china and its many neighbors as in other places in the world of course there have there have been many ups and downs and of course at one time one might say that china's soviet union relations were the most important but in the scheme of the past seven decades of the bilateral relationship as a generalization i would say despite friction here and there china dprk relations have been very tight and strategically speaking china and north korea have shared common strategic interests so the fact that north korea causes problems with its nuclear weapons and periodic provocations is a thorn is a matter of concern to china at the same time i think china sees its influence over the dprk and the rok of south korea as a matter of high strategic importance that china wants to protect thank you very much uh let me go to professor peter kosnick for his comments on the 70th anniversary between the dprk and the prc hello peter uh hello hi um i know it's the technical is difficult for you to uh to talk to us through skype but let me know briefly how you look at the ideological nature of the two ruling parties in the dprk and the prc because with the end of the cold war the chinese government made it very clear we would no longer use ideology to decide and define the nature of our diplomacy what do you think i i think china has taken a very pragmatic approach when it's dealing with its not only its neighbors but it's the other countries in asia especially in china's vision now is based on its goals more than anything else and the relationship with the dprk in many ways is an opportunity but it also poses a threat an immediate threat and uh that now both we would say like some might argue are communist countries although it depends on what definition of communism one is using um but in many ways china has departed from any kind of strict sense of communism and its own dealings in its own that's the american reckoning by the way you thought we have somehow departed from the classical definition of communism but that's the american way of thinking american perception yeah well it's definitely my perception also uh and uh but china has a hybrid economy now and uh a unique kind of political system uh and the dprk in many ways shares certain aspects of the political approach but economically the dprk has not had the kind of success that china has had really going back to the 1950s you could already say that from the 50s to the early 70s the growth the per capita gdp in north korea was higher than in south korea but for the past four decades the dprk has struggled with its economy and that's posed certain threats to china as well so china has uh in some ways a close friendship with the dprk in other ways china is very concerned by pprk policies and this is especially now in relation to the united states so when china has in the united nation supported sanctions against the dprk especially over its nuclear and missile tests that throws a different kind of spin to the dprk china relationship peter there's no question about the strategic stakes that we share with ping jiang however the korean war of 1950 has somehow defined this very meaningful bilateral relationship due politically despite the appeal of the official rhetoric concerning friendship so to speak between the two countries we face multiple challenges ever since the height of the korean war when the issue of a command whether it should rest with the korean leader kim yosung or mr pando huay the highest commander from the chinese volunteer army ever since then debates and disputes have been flaring up on and on reaching on and on and there are different interpretations about who has led the uh or shape the leadership or success of the korean war koreans have their version the chinese their own so we face to see nothing of our support of the economic sanctions imposed by the u.s led u.n campaign you put these issues into one perspective what do you think of the current so-called uh you know um strategic relationship between these two countries peter and i'd like uh professor lee from uh fletcher school uh to give me uh his answer as well first peter the the strategic relationship the current strategic relationship between dprk and china uh in the context of the korean war i mean they're the north koreans especially the dprk are very very aware of what the united states did during the korean war the united states burned down every city in north korea and pretty much every city in south korea and this is a reality that people are very aware of in the dprk according to the british army yearbook for 1951 it said even south korea no longer exists as a country because of the u.s policy there so the u.s brutality in the korean war is something that people are very much aware of the uh so when the which americans by the way are completely oblivious to in the united states we refer to the korean war as the forgotten war in china and north korea it's very much a part of their consciousness so the strategic ties now between china and north korea are essential not only to the relation between the two countries but also to the u.s attempts to as we say denuclearized the peninsula we'll discuss the issue of denuclearization later on peter but first of all uh mr yang xiu what do you think of the major issues that might be viewed as a thorny that gets in the way in our improvement of the bilateral relationship between ddprk and china for example china late chairman of the order the evacuation of up to 300 000 chinese volunteers from the territory of dprk back in 1958 and in 1961 kind of a mutual defense treaty was signed between the two countries however there was not there is not a single chinese soldier deployed in the territory of the dprk ever since at the same time why do you think there is a forward military presence of up to 700 000 american troops in northeast asia i'm left quite bewildered and confused about what it means let me put it back this way whenever we talk about the korean war we need to bear a full two concept in mind concept one civil war between the two careers concept two international war that involved by 20 countries including the united states and china so basically the korean war was broke out from the civil war and quickly evolved into the international war and china joined in the war after the international forces led blind states very close to chinese border and american bombers had bombed part of chinese territory and across the yard river yeah and especially general uh mcclassie sent a very terrible wrong strategic signal to beijing say they were going to invade into china so that strategic signal alert the beijing public chairman mao and mao made a very difficult decision say protected our country after you invade it or we need to make a attack before your invaders and under chairman king's uh requested then chairman made a later choice let me ask you so that is you know what to china we have a two walls when the war was a civil war china insisted on hands off when the international war broke out and the threat to china china was forced to join in war so that is the nature of the the second part of the war and relating to the the mutual defense treaty i need to give the whole uh exact title of the treaty that is the friendship comprehensive friendship and cooperation treaty including mutual defense cooperation so basically we we remain keeping this treaty not because that is the mutual defense but because that is a comprehensive wide range of cooperation treaty and the mutual defense is really a part of that so basically now the two countries conduct the comprehensive corporation in wide range of areas including military however the so-called mutual defense has been gone we are not a lot allied based you know whenever say well if you ask me so what about the strategic relation between nature strategic relations between china and dprk i would say china dprk relation has transformed from the military allied based relation based on the 1961 treaty to comprehensive cooperation based rather than military-based but when i look at excuse me mr young when you look at western media reports about the nature of the relationship between pinyon and beijing they would always without exceptions refer to this thai as the only ally dprk the only island of china since the end of the second world war well what do they mean uh i think at least it's a wrong description or wrong perception even distorted description for example number one neither north korea and china say something like allied relation between our two countries for north korea is a one of the important member of a non-alignment movement right they often frequently send their very senior for example number two uh official to military officers to china no no no no to non-alignment summit i see and very active in the non-amended movement that's dprk and for china we always say china is a long alignment country we never fought highlight relations with any country but we want to make a partnership with every country so in chinese it's called buddhism yes so we have a very close partnership about the alliance yeah so china and the dprk share the similarity similar uh policy doctrine say they say we are non-alignment member and china say we never i lied with any country so quite similar that's what under number two article two of the treaty you mentioned in 1998 1961 is really something like a defense a mutual defense corporation however that's only part of the whole treaty and if you look at the current state of the cooperation between two countries the male to male corporation was has been very very tiny even difficult to find for example i said i said senior media people i never see you report something all chinese military to me the dprk military like you know many other countries do but you you have reported many exchanges between china dprk in political diplomatic cultural education you know economic everything else everything but military so basically the nature and the content of the cooperation between the two countries now focus on based on comprehensive not military island therefore your understatement of the analysis suggests clearly that dprk is not an highlight of the dprk despite signing of the mutual defense treaty back in 1961 let me go back to professor lee professor lee what lessons do you think rok has drawn from the korean war in 1950 the three-year bloody regional conflict and is that one of the major reasons if not the major driving force behind the rapper's mount between rok and the dprk across the 38th parallel and what do you think of the issue of the most heavily mined area along the sensitive 38th parallel well not to be overly dramatic but i would say the korean war of 1950 to 1953 really launched international history for the region and perhaps even for the world it made the united nations into what it is today a credible international organization transforming that entity from a paper organization to a legitimate powerful international organization for china china emerged from the war with greatly enhanced international prestige china had paid a huge price in casualties but china had fought the superpower united states to a draw and that did enhance china's international standing to the rok as you mentioned it solidified i guess the inter-korean hostility north korea had invaded the south south korea was on the verge of state collapse if not for the u.s led u.n intervention so to many south koreans especially of the older generation they remember the threat they remember the atrocities they remember the war and regard north korea with skepticism whereas the younger generation and south koreans of a different political orientation view north korea more as a cumbersome poor neighbor or distant relative we have to engage north korea so within south korea there is this ongoing ideological debate by the way professor north korea and there is still a lot of skepticism by the way professor lee uh five uh now the back in 195 yes 1913 i went to dan dong in jilim province a leonin province province and i saw a group of very lovely south korean girls as part of a tourism entourage they were looking at the broken bridge riddled by bullets a legacy of the korean war and asked them a simple question what do you think of the war they shouted in corals we love peace they look like angels very impressive by the way now let's go back to the issue of the korean war uh you were talking about the role that the u.n troops played in shaping the road map or cause of the war but what do you think of the controversial representation of the u.n troops because the soviet union was found absent from a critical meeting that decided or sealed the fate of the korean war the united states during the absence of soviet ambassador decided to set up the u.n troops i mean where is the legitimacy of the representation and the soviet union was the first to recognize the people's republic of china in 1949 a few days after the founding of the prc and yet eight its delegate its representative was absent what do you think of this part of the most mysterious story well that perhaps was a tactical uh error on the part of the soviet union but not to lay the blame on the soviet union you know it was the soviet ambassador's choice to boycott the u.n security council meetings but i think the the more pertinent question perhaps is would the united states nonetheless have gone in uh to defend south korea to fight against north korea even without a u.n security council sanction resolution and you know that's a virtual question what if kind of question but i think so i think the us would have gone in alone with let's say a coalition of the willing with other nations that wanted to support the united states so uh in those days of course as of february 1950 the soviet union was an ally of the prc and then the bilateral relationship progressively throughout the 1950s deteriorated between beijing and moscow that is so the fact that there is um the history of u.n initiative and intervention does accord does give some legitimacy a lot of legitimacy to the u.s led expedition to china the problem was an entirely different matter a strategic matter as the u.n u.s led forces with rok forces and the british and so on approached china's border and we see historical parallels of china uh you know making the very difficult decision to go to war as foreign troops advance toward it back in the 1590s for example when japan invaded korea so the strategic geostrategic importance of the korean peninsula as an avenue through which invaders may approach china or approach japan in the case of the mongols in the 13th century that significance remains to this day thank you very much let me go to peter kosnick hi peter yet another major issue concerning the prospect of the korean peninsula is the reunification of course the dprk allegedly launched the invasion i mean allegedly launched the innovation back in 1950 triggering the outbreak of the hostilities but today they still demand reunification what do you think of the chinese statement and position the dmz and the eventual reunification hopefully i think that everybody envisions the possibility of reunification and hopes that this can be achieved at some point the interesting thing about recent developments is the role that moon jae-in place donald trump says that he wants the nobel peace prize for his effort to resolve the conflict with uh north korea but everybody knows that donald trump is not the one who deserves the real credit for what's happening it's uh moon jae-in uh as the people of south korea and the candlelight revolution that brought louis to power uh but this is a process that's going to unfold very very slowly the whole question of denuclearization is something that we see as very much of a long-term process we've got to be very very patient yes we must adopt a long-term perspective in examining the future of the korean peninsula they divided the one finally mr yang xiu what about the chronic issue of a trust that both sides of seek to enhance uh we see some kind of a friction and debates between the two governments objectively speaking do you think generally basically we have laid solid foundation and groundwork for the strategic mutual trust for us to move forward and do you think dprk is like is likely to join inspiration from the success of china's reform and opening up that late senior leader exalting initiated 40 years ago first of all eprc is really determined to learn not copy chinese or vietnamese models for example they have set up more than 30 special economic zones all over the state just like chinese and vietnamese however internal policy condition has been similar with beijing and hanoi they want to reform want to open however a similar condition is totally different from china and vietnam for example when china decide to open vietnam decide to open and the external uh environment is friendly say capitals trade opportunities a lot of that just imagine punya want to open they have 30 as i mentioned 30 plus zones but no foreign investment into because of the samsung regime in short the international multilateral plat unilateral sanction regime really isolate the north korea so basically for north korea they want to open for the international community we need to bring about the generalization and the peace so that let north korea join in the international community it seems the process of denuclearization will determine very much the future of north korea's economic being with that we come to the conclusion of this discussion about the 70th anniversary of the relationship between ping-pong and beijing i'll see you next time [Music] goodbye
