hi everyone welcome to my channel my name is amy park i'm a north korean de facto human rights activist so i don't know how many of you know that i also host another channel on youtube in korean with my korean north korean colleague called change north korea he's from a top class in north korea he was working as a restaurant manager so he was almost he had a passport that shows what kind of elite he was only only tiny tiny tiny percent top elite in north korea is able to travel abroad and he was one of them and i talked about how he you know took his 12 ladies working in the restaurant and then brought them to freedom in my previous video however with that turn that we are running right now we have been receiving so many requests from north korea's populists who are working abroad wants to escape and this is an amazing news because this can bring down kim jong-un we actually guys might be able to see the fault of kim jong-un's regime in a very recent time i will talk about why and also wide elites of north korea dreaming of escaping there are several things going on inside north korea right now due to the coronavirus and of course i mean coronavirus affected all of us here but however it affected even harshly to north koreans the more average people in north korea are not afraid die from covet actually unfortunately because they can die from starvation first in oppression and going to concentration camp so many other things can kill them before the covet almost 99 of north koreans are not worried about this virus but what worrying them is the lockdown that is coming from this pandemic kim jong-un blocked entire border he blocked entire movement within the country the people why he wasn't even providing anything to the people so it was almost like you know putting your inner inner cell in a prison and then demanding you survive on your own it's called a self-reliance so he's been demanding everybody every north korean be self-reliant and give everything they can to the region including the elite think about that like so the people that have been reaching out to us to ask ask us how they can escape safely as an elite is that they don't send this even hackers right they have actual skill set that is helping kim jong-un they send these hackers to china and it's like traders and everybody going to china they sometimes you bring their own family with them to live abroad and working for the regime while there are kim jong-un tells them you gotta be self-reliant therefore he does not give them any salary while he's demanding each worker brings a foreign currency like maybe ten thousand dollars per month or like hundred thousand dollars per month each person gets this quora to make money whatever it is even it's selling the drugs weapons whatever it is make the money for me and you i don't give you any money now with the corner why are these workers in russia in the middle east in china they really don't know how to make this much money and make this quota in a way such a irony the regime began saying i'm going to provide everything for your needs as long as you trust me trust the government we are going to take care of your education health care everything but now the regime actually demanding every individual taking care of the regime why we do not even get basic even human rights so these workers now working in china russia and middle east they are making their everything they could and that every penny the regime takes from them so they can't even pay the rent why working for this dictator this is how bizarre and inhumane this region is this like unheard of who can do that like how entitled kim jong is i can't even like believe this guy what is thinking in his head what is it thinking like this so people now in inside north korea the elites are worrying about the coronavirus because even though elites are well-fed relatively well-fed at the countryside people still they are not like getting enough protein vitamins all those nutrients so even the elite's health are not that great only maybe 10 000 people in north korea gets whatever they want and those people of course they're gonna have vaccines from china versus other countries those top top doesn't worry but the below top like maybe one percent is worrying about corona virus in kanye and because nobody can do trading right now any produce any goods so they are just demanding every penny from the average people in the countryside and the people in the countryside now saying we are not slaves to the people in the character and they are not happy so i think this is really gonna this panda me gonna break kim jong-un if kim don't go in this direction of really not knowing what to prioritize because even the elites working abroad wants to escape this elite is not only contacting me or other people anybody actually working in this world right now like in north korean human rights award they get contact by these elites asking us like how can we escape what is a safe route escape honestly i cannot of course share with you guys how they can do it it became a lot harder to rescue elites even though they have passport it became a lot harder because china does not cooperate however it is such an amazing sign even these hackers working for kim jong-un wants to escape and i did not know like until i've been you know being contacted by elites of north korea recently i did not know the degree of oppression that elites were facing too i literally thought in the past that the elites were so so like getting so much out of this like current status quo i thought they were the ones supporting the regime that is why the regime was lasting for this one but now i'm realizing the elites were also equally square scared actually only more scared than us like for us mostly likely number one chance to kill us is a disease and starvation but number one thing they get killed is uh the the political assassins and kim jong-un just gets upset by somebody and somehow their cousin was like the someone they're working for kim jong-un and because of their cousin's strongly they're gonna like be executed so they just don't know they're walking on this like eyes should never know when it's gonna melt down every single day they get up they don't know what's gonna happen to their life they're still like a lifespan i just really hope that more elites take that risk take the risk to be like living like a human being to fight for their dignity and fight for their country and thank you guys again for giving me this platform make me visible so more elites finding me and finding us and contacting us so we can really do this movement of bringing our north korean people i'm grateful for you guys if you really support what i do
