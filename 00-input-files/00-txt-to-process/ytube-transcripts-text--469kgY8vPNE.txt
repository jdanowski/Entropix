and kim jong-un demanded the soldiers using a shovel to put and gather what was remaining after the execution and take them away and then what he did was demanding every artist stand up and go closer and then take a look around of the side of the execution so many of them were like fainting peeing in their pants and and do you know what this does when you see something like public execution once you are traumatized for the rest of your life hi guys welcome to my channel my name is yami park i'm a north korean de facto human rights activist so today i have a very important news to deliver i still somehow do not get it this is happening in this 21st century and north korea is so much so forgotten from the rest of the humanity we you have no clue what is happening in the darkness and there is only this like few news that we get out and made majorly from the border towns and in the capital so the news that i got in recent days is that it's just heartbreaking kim jong-un literally executed the main conductor from an orchestra for 90 times [Applause] after his execution if you shoot somebody for 90 times really especially these days those bullets are so strong a human gonna lose a shape they are not even gonna look like a human all is gonna left is just a lot of pieces of meat and bones uh on the ground and kim jong-un demanded the soldiers using a shovel to put and gather what was remaining after the execution and take them away but during his public execution kim jong ordered every single artist go demand watch this public execution i will tell you why this man the conductor got executed what could he have possibly done in this 23 getting get killed in that most cruel way this year on february 16th that was a north korea is one of the biggest holidays that was when kim jong-il the second king was born supposedly so and there was something new happened again kim jong-un his wife little zoo who was disappeared for last 13 months certainly reappeared on that birthday and then kim jong-un took her to visit his father's grave in the morning and afternoon attending this performance by this orchestra it's called and often we think it's like north korea's girl group but yeah so this group is designated to have a performance in front of kings and there's a huge orchestra and there's a main conductor and the man who died was tohonu his name is zhou and he was a humble kid after each these performances with kim attending north koreans all have to do this gathering after and assess and analyze which part that kim kim jong liked the most which part he didn't like the most and learning and then try to get better but in this time sometimes kim jong-un personally says oh i like hd singer maybe i like this part about the whole performance this time kim jong-un said somehow he really liked they did something new magic with the shadow magic so they do some like tricks with the shadow and north korea and artists are trying that for the first time this year somehow kim jong-un was very impressed impressed by it however the in this delivery of the meeting in front of old artists people were saying okay this is the part where the deal leader liked the most so letting the people know and there's some prize to get if you were liked by kim but this conductor said i'm not even sure that was no huge deal why would he compliment on such a thing but it wasn't like he was standing up and telling everybody about that he was just like more talking to his like close friend in the orchestra and of course this friend was a spy and reported on him this is a tricky thing this happened to actually my own mother my mother uh when kim your son died the first came in 1994 i was like infant few month old infant my mom heard a rumor that the kim song died not from exhaustion by working for the people like literally north koreans told me the region told us that kim song died from exhaustion and hunger and starvation because he was working so entirely for the people but somebody told her that actually kim died from heart attack not from the exhaustion so she told her best friend saying can you believe there are such a people saying these kind of bad things about their leader and then that lady reported on my mom luckily my mom survived however this time in north korean settings is like this there are three people i am watching this friend but while i'm being a spy i know that i'm being spied on by somebody else so even if i'm being a nice person not gonna report on this person this person gonna report on me but if that person who doesn't report on me someone got deported on them so you are being spied and spying on somebody this system creates complete distrust between people we cannot even trust our own bag in north korea joyouni he spoke to his friend about like he wasn't too impressed by the shadow magic and he reported and kim jong un got so upset so he said gather every single artist in pyongyang and once they got gathered he demanded to shoot him for 90 times so each ak-47 gun has like 30 30 shots inside and used it all and every artist had to see from in front of their eyes so there were times in 2013 there was a pleasure squad group that kim jong-il gave a gift to his son there were some rumors about that group was not being lawyer and they had some uh capitalistic sentiment in that group so kim jong-un got so angry but which that group was actually where lizard his wife is from other than that few people and also this girls knew about the secrets of research before marrying kim jong-un so that was a main excuse for kim jong-un to kill all of them anybody knew the past of literature he won't be gone so he executed more than 10 artists in that group and few of them were even pregnant at the time after getting all these artists and killing this more than 10 10 of them after kill i mean shooting them that many times they don't even look like a human and then what he did was demanding every artist stand up and go closer and then take a look around of the side of the execution so many of them were like fainting peeing in their pants and and do you know what this does when you see something like public execution once you are traumatized for the rest of your life there is no going back once you see something like that there is no turning back ever in human psychology but this artist is not like they only get to see this once they see it so often and imagine in the horror they are gonna be terrified to death and the only thing they remember at the point is like i will be obedient as much as i can so i will never dying like that and that that is a thing that's what kim jong is doing now and why would he always persecuting artists in the brutal ways also that he thinks someone artist is more open-minded they are more prone to corrupt in their ideology so if the for normal like general population we do thing called a self uh criticism sessions once a week but for artists once even two days that's how kim jong makes sure the artist their minds it doesn't get corrupt and their anti-ideology of lifting the party and the revolution and kim is like always on that point this is unbelievable there is nothing we can do to stop this kind of inhumane public execution in north korea but i think all i can do right now is be the voice for the voiceless and i really hope you guys use your voice use your platform to raise awareness about my people so somehow international community can understand how grim the human rights situations in north korea is and come up with a better policy in convincing china to stop sponsoring this dictatorship in north korea so please share this video guys hit that like button and let everybody know what's happening to my people and i look forward to seeing you guys all next time
