[Music] an airfield near atlanta emergency dr mike flickiger is embarking on a special mission destination north korea they said this is a medical evacuation we need you to go in and bring him out a mission to retrieve u.s citizen otto warmbier last seen in public 14 months earlier a prisoner of the regime of north korea warmongering between rivals kim jong-un and donald trump is at its peak they will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen a silent mission on a difficult route we elected not to use south korea china or russia to help us plan the mission days later otto warmbier is back home but he's fatally ill severe brain damage says the coroner cause unknown was it torture warmbier's parents become pawns in a game played by president trump who later announces that the north korean leader knew nothing about warmbier all i can do is shake my head right too many lies right when the state department sends emergency doctor mike fluckiger to north korea his plane of choice is still in africa the carrier phoenix air often evacuates ebola patients but for this mission fluckager insists on the best plane and the best team he doesn't even tell his family where he's headed i didn't tell him exactly where i had been until the mission was over because it was becoming more and more apparent that this was a special mission i told him i was going to korea to pick up a patient i did not say north korea at phoenix air's headquarters a second team led by chief operator den thompson has to solve a logistical problem the plane will not be allowed to refuel in pyongyang currently there are certain sanctions that are in place between the u.s government and the north korean government and for us to pay for anything we would have to get special permits which we simply did not have time to do on the morning of june 10 2017 a saturday the plane takes off on its mission fluckiger is joined by two male nurses and two u.s state department representatives [Music] with refueling stops in montana and alaska their flight takes them halfway around the globe to northern japan and hopefully on to pyongyang [Music] the outskirts of cincinnati ohio otto warmbier grew up here in the suburb of wyoming at first his parents don't answer our inquiries they aren't seeking the spotlight the town has modest and affluent neighborhoods otto warmbier's father runs a medium-sized business otto the oldest of three children is the pride of both his family and his high school at graduation he holds the commencement address his future is mapped out college in virginia a scholarship a planned semester abroad in hong kong but first a new year's adventure north korea he books through a chinese travel agency its slogan we take you to destinations your mother would rather you stay away from he joins an international group they have a great time he's left an indelible mark on me he was such a lovely lad and i've spoken to a lot of people who were on the tour and we're all absolutely absolutely devastated every year the agency touts their dazzling travel highlight in pyongyang the alcohol flows freely the tour guides make sure everyone's in a good mood nights are long at pyongyang's only hotel for foreigners otto's group has fun too it isn't clear whether they also took on the challenge of the forbidden fifth floor but many tourists have done so in the [Music] past it is the staff's floor with hallways full of propaganda slogans the hotel surveillance center is also located here tourists are usually just admonished they act innocent and run off this new year's eve however the cameras capture someone taking a poster from the wall it is 1 57 am and it is according to the trial otto warmbier instead of leaving north korea with the others on january 2nd he's taken into custody and he has simply had to tap on the shoulder two guards took him away and i sort of laughingly said to him well that's the last we'll ever see of you and because we got on so well otto turned around and just chuckled at me but of course there was a huge irony in my words that we obviously didn't know what was going to happen but that was the last time anyone actually saw him two months later north korea's propaganda televises a staged confession i entirely beg you people and government of the dpr korea for your forgiveness please i have made the worst mistake of my life but please i never should have allowed myself to be a lord by the united states administration to commit a crime in this country a show trial with obviously coerced statements perhaps in exchange for a pardon 16 days later warmbier discovers that his hopes were in vain he is publicly sentenced to 15 years of hard labor for subversive activities his condition from this point on remains uncertain shortly before takeoff dr mike fluckiger is given the few details known about warmbier's condition i had one small written note one paragraph about his condition saying he was in a coma that pyongyang friendship hospital that's really all i knew except that he had been hospitalized for 15 months was flokiger worried about the threat of war not really he says i think i had felt that the relationship between north korea and the u.s had been bad for a while and no i i thought if this door had opened to bring otto warmbier back then there had been negotiations to ease things a little bit in fact north korea's sudden diplomatic effort surprises the u.s negotiators mickey bergman is one of them since warmbier's arrest he had been trying to gain access to him with the help of you in contacts bergman works together with bill richardson former governor of new mexico and former u.s ambassador to the u.n hardly any other team is as experienced in dealing with pyongyang as they are in general the the only available direct channel that we have are the people that represent north korea here the united nations in this case the individuals are people that know the governor from before they know me from before so that's a direct channel but at the end of the day they are not decision makers and if you want to get to a deal when you want to get to an understanding you have to be there in person so the first priority is okay how do we get ourselves invited to north korea to make sure that we can talk to the people who can make decisions about this it was different in that you knew that otto warmbier by the north koreans was considered something special because he was from the midwest he was an attractive young man he was an all-america boy you knew this one was special because it got a lot of tv coverage from north korea the trial where the young man was in trauma he was very upset and he was carried around and you knew that this was a very sensitive time in united states north korea relations so the north koreans you knew early on would use them as a bargaining chip to get something back from the united states they always use political prisoners as bargaining chips they want something in return would that be typical that u.s inmates suffered physical torture or physical violence the north koreans are very tough on interrogations and their prisons are not ideal sometimes they make these political prisoners work in the fields so labor is involved do they specifically torture i don't have any evidence that they do do they treat the prisoners well no i think where the north koreans fall short is just in international standards of allowing consular visits sometimes they do sometimes they don't it depends on the prize of the prisoner that they hold they want to dramatize it as much as they can insiders call these contacts between north korea's u.n representatives and people like richards the new york channel for a long time it's been the only connection between the two countries here at the palm restaurant it is kept alive with steak and lobster over meetings that take place every few weeks mickey bergman believes he's close to a breakthrough he's told to come to pyongyang we got the invitation and when i went there even on the plane on the way i did have that fantasy in in my mind that i'm coming back with otto swedish diplomats also pressure pyongyang there is a meeting of diplomats in oslo but no progress is made i was told uh that look don't don't be disparaged there's a saying in korea that he takes a thousand hacks to bring down a tree and my response was i hope i don't need to come back again you know however more times in order to get it happen but i get the message the kim regime seems to buy time keen to use warmbier as an asset kim won't negotiate until he feels protected by his new nuclear weapons at the u.n general assembly north korea's delegation ignores both the threats and the insults made by the newly elected u.s president rocket man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime north korea is still studying donald trump's behavior waiting for new insights [Music] the obama administration and north korean relationship was not good the policy was strategic patience more sanctions more sanctions the north koreans they weren't happy with that obviously and they saw in a new administration well maybe you know we show that we're ready to deal and and otto warmbier is is the closest thing to to a concession but what was it that convinced pyongyang to allow ailing otto warmbier to be evacuated does the regime believe america will be grateful or is warmbier already so weak that they just don't want him to die as their prisoner flikir asks himself the same questions until his crew suffers the first setback when they reach sapporo that evening their flight seems doomed [Music] the local flight control center doesn't have the information it needs the plane is grounded they told me that the japanese air traffic control because there was no relationship with north korea did not want to let us fly directly to north korea that would they would have to send us to another route to a country that they did have relationship with and then at that point we would fly in i called back up to the u.s department of state and got a very high level person on the phone and i said here's the situation unless you can intercede and resolve this this trip is over after nighttime crisis calls with government officials japan's prime minister eventually gives the go-ahead the next morning fliker's plane receives clearance to fly from sapporo to pyongyang a flight route that doesn't officially exist when the plane was probably 100 miles east of the north korean boundary the japanese air traffic controller said we're now terminating surf service north korea is in front of you have a nice day and then turned off the radio the pyongyang airport contacts the plane by radio hours later on the ground flickiger's team is escorted to the building where warmbier has been hospitalized for months we were dropped off at the front door of the hospital and the company down a hallway up up the stairs and when we entered the room there were two doctors and four nurses one was the chief of staff of the hospital and one was the doctor who had been in charge of otto's care during the time that he had been in the hospital and so they said you can examine otto my first impression was he's not in a coma he he was awake he had his eyes open he was not responsive purposefully responsive but he was reactive to noise and touch and so on and then the doctors and nurses confirmed that flickager examines warmbier asks the doctors more questions it was a standard physical exam i listened to his heart and lungs checked his eyes pupils did a neurologic exam as best i could i had what i felt was enough time to examine that's when i started asking questions they said well oh what's let's go out you finish your exam then we'll go out and talk you must have had also on your mind what happened to make him fall into a condition right yeah absolutely what did you think well uh the north koreans had two possible explanations one was botulism poisoning which they could not test for they said he had eaten a pork meal as he today went into prison and could he have had botulism poisoning which can cause you to stop breathing but it would not happen that quickly in general didn't sound very possible the other was that they had given him two sedatives on the night he went in because he was very agitated upset and uh that either he had a bad reaction or they gave him too much they said that themselves did you have a feeling in north korea that the doctors were hiding something from you i certainly was looking for signs of torture uh could could this be torture and what i uh concluded for my physical exam was that i could not see any signs of torture uh i had the feeling they were they were forthcoming with their information and didn't seem that they were hiding anything and uh we examined all of his skin and found no evidence of any skin breakdown after a hospitalization of that length that's pretty remarkable so that to me uh indicated that that he got good care he got attentive care and uh yeah it's an indicator did you have in mind the parents waiting not knowing was that something that happened the whole time the whole time we were there since warmbier's parents still won't talk to us we talk to people they have been more open with a two hours drive from new york we meet one of them the warmbiers had turned to him for help early on a former diplomat with korean experience we discuss what strategic patience means for the families should they remain silent to keep from endangering negotiations or not sent their mobile satellite trucks during many many hours of rather emotional conversations that we had on the phone uh i began to hear this argument uh from them and i pushed back against it and i gave them evidence that that there were efforts being made uh not just efforts by me and other civilians but people in the government uh but i also made the point to them that something was different about the way that otto's case was being handled and it made the normal diplomatic intervention that you would expect to work with the north koreans it made that ineffective the warmbiers have even stopped talking to otto's school month after month goes by with no sign of life from their son nobody knows that in far away north korea he was seen from the outset as a prisoner of war with no access to diplomats following trump's inauguration warmbier's parents speak out and accuse the obama administration of failure although they met with his secretary of state john kerry several times they confided in trump's favorite network fox news easy prey for their hosts ongoing partisan crusade against obama's democrats john kerry was secretary of state at the time did you speak to him we met with and what was the outcome of that a nice guy nice person did he help you in any way totally exasperated and overwhelmed with north korea totally did he help you in any way no absolutely not did anyone in the state department help you in any way no no absolutely not the first thing after i got the phone call was did you read the state department blog or whatever on north korea korea before you let them go and wait someone from the state department said that to you in other words blaming you for the kidnapping and imprisonment of your son it was your fault that was the message from the state department right they acted like we were ignorant basically for letting them go we feel it so they judged you and blamed you for your son's kidnapping by the north korean government yes like it was your fault that's what you got when you reached out to the us government for help right you got blame and judgment and they asked us to stay quiet because they said it's better for everyone involved better for the bureaucrats because nobody knows how little they're doing when nobody talks about it do you have a message for this new state department for secretary tillerson what would you like him to do sure i'd like to work with him to bring otto home he can make a difference here he's a doer may be disrespectful to ask for that president trump i ask you bring my son home you can make a difference here i pray this is resolved thanks a lot for joining us one thing i know for sure i i have not been a parent that lost a kid and that's something that i was talking to fred and cindy warmbier throughout is that those things take time it doesn't mean that you need to sit back and and trust that the government is doing everything for it because the government has complex sets of interests but it takes time and on average in north korea it's between a year and a half and two years and in all the scenarios that i've ever imagined working on this and we worked on it for about 18 months um i always imagined that it does get resolved and otto does come home and i had never imagined in all this time the scenario of what actually ended up happening what upset me was that it took them a year to admit that he was in a coma they never told us that the north korean context we had said that they didn't know either that he was in a coma that's possible he was controlled a young man auto by the security services and they don't communicate with each other this is a country of enormous secrecy only the top only the top echelon knows what's going on and they decide who gets the information within their own government the north korean doctors hand over their ct scans of warmbier's brain to dr flickiger he writes a report but still warmbier is a prisoner [Music] the door opens and here comes a judge in a judge's robe he goes to that same spot i was in and he conducted a a little ten minute court hearing to commute otto warmbier's sentence so he was still a prisoner he had to have an official hearing to release him and then at that point they brought in all of otto's belongings and they wanted us to go through him piece by piece and check it off we said just give us his passport his wallet just give us everything on june 13 2017 otto warmbier finally leaves north korea the vibration and noise of the airplane was was really difficult for him and it made him stiffen up and almost as if he were having a convulsion so we gave small doses of standard sedating drugs the two nurses and i said talk to each other about how do we want the parents to see him do we want him to be fully awake or do we want him to be calm and sedated and we decide should be calm and sedated [Music] fluckiger's crew flies home via their planned route until the white house administration's claims of success create another mishap at the president's direction the department of state has secured the release of otto warmbier from north korea he is on his way in route home to be reunited with his family we began to talk with the ground handling people at cincinnati international and they said the media was showing up truck after truck and it was getting out of control and we said look we highly recommend that we change the arrival airport from cincinnati international airport to lumpkin regional airport warmbier's parents and his two younger siblings are waiting outside the hangar the rescue team decides to give them time on board alone with otto we all understood what a terrible situation this was for them we escorted them onto the plane 15 minutes out from the airport we had given him another dose of the sedative and he was very calm and quiet the minute parents got up there started talking to him he woke up so it was my impression of the nurse's impression that yeah he at some level recognized his parents voices i think so yeah he just immediately woke up and was kind of that in that agitated state it was so hard to watch fred warmbier later describes their reunion i knelt down by his side and i hugged him and i told him i missed him and i was so glad that he made it home since the airport doesn't have the necessary equipment warmbier is carried from the plane while his mother and father look on this will be the last public photograph of him for a long time she and i firmly believe that he fought to stay alive through the worst that the north koreans could put him through in order to return to the family and community he loves but the hope that he recovers is short-lived he shows no signs of understanding language responding to verbal commands or awareness of his surroundings a week later the family gives up they have all life support systems switched off otto warmbier dies fred and cindy warmbier continue to stay out of the limelight but when north korea itself claims to be the victim in the case they make another appearance on fox news they describe otto's return home in stark terms otto had a shaved head he had a feeding tube coming out of his nose he had he was he was staring blankly into space jerking violently he was blind he was deaf as we looked at him and tried to comfort him it looked like someone had taken a pair of pliers and rearranged his bottom teeth within two days of otto being home his fever spiked to a hundred and four degrees he had a large scar on his right foot north korea is not a victim they're terrorists they destroyed they purposely and intentionally injured otto with no evidence trump twitter's great interview otto was tortured beyond belief by north korea before and also with no evidence a government official had told the new york times that otto had been repeatedly beaten [Music] however neither the hospital nor the coroner we consulted found any evidence of torture but what was the cause of death we have evidence that his brain was deprived of oxygen for a length of time significant enough to cause severe anoxic encephalopathy in other words brain damage caused by lack of oxygen to the brain has to be at least at least four minutes this is an example of what a normal brain looks like and then this is an example of a brain with changes similar to what otto had where you can see that the ventricles are huge and the rest of the brain tissue is really shrunken meaning that the entire brain was deprived of oxygen for a significant amount of time if he was struck here he might have changes here but then he would may also have something called contracu injury which is across the brain to this side of the head he might have changes as well but what caused the brain injury waterboarding electric shocks a suicide attempt all possible she says including pyongyang's own explanation if they gave him something to sedate him that made him stop breathing for a period of time a long enough period of time absolutely her specialists also examined the scar on his foot their findings were inconclusive i can't argue with anybody that says hey this could have been caused by electrodes it could have been but maybe it was something that was placed in the skin that got infected that could have been too so there's nothing specific about that healed scar what remains is the allegation that warmbier's lower teeth were forcibly twisted yet the coroner says there would be signs of trauma this is an example of the changes that he had in his lower teeth the forensic odontologist looked at it as well and agreed that there was no trauma at all to those roots and you can't pull teeth out and then rearrange them and put them in different places without there being trauma to the roots if i had any evidence and concrete evidence that there was a criminal act here i would be very loud about it and would definitely be stating that unfortunately the evidence we have does not point to anything in particular as far as this is what happened to him at first the coroner withholds the results out of respect for the morning family but in her mailbox she also found warnings it felt vaguely threatening and that i shouldn't that i was being disloyal to the president and that i shouldn't disagree with the president especially in such a public way efforts to get to the bottom of the warmbier case have resulted in countless files and articles much of the information is contradictory establishing the truth would also pose a challenge to the federal court in washington where the warmbiers file a lawsuit against north korea with the help of government-friendly experts and lawyers pyongyang does not contest to the case and the trial takes place with the plaintiffs only and strangely enough without flokiker and the coroner appearing as witnesses one expert witness urges the judge to hand down a spectacular verdict i replied i do believe that this case has the potential to go beyond the personal tragedies offered by the warmbier family and perhaps one day save lives that is deter north korea with the right kind of punitive damages and the judgment that the judge will make the expert continues making controversial claims citing the question of otto warmbier's teeth for example his teeth were imperfect you know fine alignment straight when he was returned it was clear that at least two of his lower teeth had been realigned which is a polite way of saying plucked out and then shoved back in he also claims that north korea tortured warmbier to deter the us from military action but washington didn't even know of his condition i can follow that they need a hostage if they provoke the world as some kind of security issue or asset but that doesn't work if you kill your asset how should that work uh well whether they have to kill so this is a slightly different angle of discussion very important but did north korea intend to kill its victim or not i don't know for sure but that does not matter in the legal case in the end the court orders north korea to pay half a billion dollars based among other things on the president's public confirmation that north korea tortured otto for a while the warmbiers publicly stand by the president lending their support to his fight against the north korean dictatorship after a shameful trial the dictatorship sentenced otto to 15 years of heart labor otto's wonderful parents fred and cindy warmbier are here with us tonight please you are powerful witnesses to a menace that threatens our world and your strength truly inspires us all thank you very much thank you [Applause] at some point the north korean leader clearly decides that his rockets provide the country with sufficient protection maybe he's spent enough time studying the us president to see he only needs to compliment trump to get his way and although kim refuses to demobilize trump starts to praise him like never before he even exonerates kim in the warmbier case i don't think that the top leadership knew about it you know you got a lot of people a big country a lot of people and in those prisons and those camps you have a lot of people and some really bad things happen to otto some really really bad things why are you what he tells me he tells me that he didn't know about it and i will take him at his word yes ma'am go ahead please otto warmbier has served his purpose kim jong-un is now a friend of donald trump he wrote me beautiful letters and they're great letters we fell in love the warmbiers are shocked and react in writing kim and his evil regime are responsible for the death of our son no excuses or lavish praise can change that i had a call and talked to friends in it just to check in every now and then we talk a little bit and that was an important moment because i knew that they that must have been emotional um it's hard for me to explain donald trump president trump's tactics in this um i am supportive of engagement with north korea obviously that's what we do um i am not a fan of the high wire personal diplomacy because it might work on a tactical level but when it fails we're on the brink of war i would hope that he was not trying to use the family i think he genuinely felt for the family and for otto but then his statements about kim jong-un my buddy and are very disconcerting and disappointing in new york we soon come across more disturbing details allegedly the official torture claim was controversial from the outset within the trump administration says ex-diplomat evans revere he received a call after citing the accusation in a radio broadcast i merely cited the new york times story and the fact that a u.s government official apparently had confirmed that there had been torture this made the senior official who called me rather upset and he made a point of calling me directly and saying that there had been no torture that otto came back and it was obvious that he had been well cared for in the hospital that he didn't have any bed sores or the things that you would normally expect of a torture victim to have i said i'm not confirming it i'm not denying it i'm just repeating what what he had said and he said well i just want to let you know for the record that there was no torture we ask in washington if that's true the white house doesn't answer the state department responds by saying we won't have a comment on this when we ask for permission to film otto warmbier's grave his mother agrees to accompany us [Music] hours later it's clear she isn't coming she texts us to cancel the interview [Music] a year later we meet in berlin the warmbiers now see themselves as international campaigners against north korea for otto's sake that's otto and i we did a tandem bicycle race and that's otto playing football and he loved that they also show us previously unseen pictures and that's how otto looked when we got him home that's otto with his mom they are plagued by more than their loss they still need clarity that doesn't just happen and he didn't have any scars on his body that's that's that doesn't just happen think about this a 21 year old kid who's like i described works out all the time eats healthy how do you end up a vegetable otherwise and flokiger how does he feel about the mission that both succeeded and failed shortly after his return home to cartersville georgia news channels claimed that the u.s paid north korea two million dollars for hospital costs which is later denied and north korea insists that warmbier returned home healthy the north koreans said they had released odo in good shape and he died in the u.s what's your comment on that yes i know look at that they took him back to america and he died in six days well when i read that i all i can do is shake my head right too many lies he says and i was only the doctor [Music] you
