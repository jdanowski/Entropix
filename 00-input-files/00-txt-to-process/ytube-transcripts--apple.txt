Dina... Where are you guys headed? ♪♪ what's going on everyone it's justin here and today we've got a very cool video for you and it's the fact that we're about to get a call from craig federighi in just a couple minutes who's the senior vice president of software engineering at apple and you might have seen him from all the events of wwdc for example and we're going to be asking him a couple questions both in terms of his desk setup as well as their approach to communication and what they see in the whole ecosystem moving forward so this is honestly like super cool for me because i started making youtube videos about 13 years ago and i just remember like running to the library and trying to catch a little bit of wwdc's main keynote and i'd run around and tell all my friends about the new releases and i was really really into the tech side of things whether it was software the computers and also the kind of beta side of things where i would download it on my smartphone and try out all the new features for the very first time so it's super cool that we get to do this so without further ado let's just go ahead and jump right into it hello hey greg how are you hey justin i'm doing all right yeah i really enjoyed the event yesterday by the way and um oh good yeah i remember uh i started making youtube videos about 13 years ago about apple products and i would like sneak to the library during recess and try to catch as much of the wwdc uh conference so yeah i really appreciate this opportunity to be able to speak with you oh well thank you so much for taking the time yeah the uh the production quality of the of the events in last year has been really nice the apple park looks absolutely beautiful and um yeah that's something that uh we really appreciate like the video side of things but of course also the the tech and the ios and all the exciting updates um so yeah i thought i would uh ask you um we do cover a lot about like desk setups and like workspaces and i know that's been a huge part of apple's focus both on like the software side but i was curious uh what is your kind of go-to desk set up your favorite accessories your go-to like tech products whether it's the computer and sort of the work from home or the like the office setup like my physical setup well of course uh i i gather i gather you probably have a much more refined setup than i do i when uh we first all got sort of shoved out the door and had to go work at home i was uh uh having to innovate with with what i could find lying around the house and so i had like what was pretty much one of those uh you know tables you'll you'll put out like a card table kind of thing i unfolded and then i uh uh you know stack some books up to put a 27 inch monitor on and then i i open my uh uh 13 inch m1 macbook pro in front of it so i've got kind of an over under you know two circular kind of thing and i like using the track pad um so so that's my my main deal there and then i usually have an ipad um actually a couple of them off to the each side uh but my real innovation was for the the sit sand thing i found a oh yeah a foot a foot stool nearby which i then put on the table and so mid meeting i just lift my display up and uh drop it up there and so you get you get an upper body workout incorporated with the whole uh the whole thing so yeah it's it's pretty embarrassingly low tech but uh does the job well the standing desk has definitely been like a huge trend that we've seen become very popular i know like the setup has really changed like for people in tech who try out a lot of products it's always exciting to see the the new ones coming out the m1 lineup has also been a lot of fun um the imac has become a very nice go-to product for conference calls and everything um so i was like what's like your kind of most exciting feature that that is i know there's a lot of different things that were announced yesterday but what's like your single most exciting feature to to utilize whether it's on the ios the ipad os and the mac os side yeah most exciting so uh of course on the one hand i really love the the new enhancements we made to the swift language but i don't think that's what you're asking about on the on the consumer front the the thing i'm most eager to use more broadly right now is everything we announced was share play because it's one of those things we've been working on so hard but we've only been able to use it with each other at work not the people not our friends and family who they don't even get to know what we're working on until now so now with the public beta just around the corner i hope to have a lot of uh a lot of friends and family i can start share playing with and uh i think that's gonna be fantastic for sure yeah it's always fun to like share videos with and i know like the supported platforms as well i'm constantly sending links to like a funny video i'm watching a lot of tick tock in the past year or so but that transitions into like my main question of like how do you manage the creativity and decide which features get implemented and is it based on consumer need similar to like the big focus on like facetime and the whole like video conferencing experience of people using their devices for both personal and also work life yeah you know i think what's uh really special about apple and i think why a lot of us are drawn to apple is to build the products we want for ourselves which may sound kind of selfish but you know you we grow up using apple products we all dream about what could be and we come here to to do it and so so much of what we build and what we built this time were the kind of things that we said you know what would be great is if i could watch things together with people on facetime and uh you know all of these things and so there are always ideas flowing around this place some some of the ideas that we um implemented this year you know we first were talking about them ten years ago and five years ago but part of what as we look to figure out what we should do in any given year it is a little bit dictated by what do we think we want what do we think that the the world is ready for what do we think uh you know all the the techno technological stars are aligning you know now with uh everyone online to the degree they are with the connectivity we have it was a moment where this vision we've had for so long about being together even when you're not physically together and extending these experiences it felt like we could really deliver on it in a big way this year and so when the stars align like that then you start pulling on all of those those threads pulling them all together and uh and that's what we did this year with uh with share play for sure yeah i think like the whole like unification and the emphasis on ecosystem has been really cool to see the m1 lineup uh of like ios and uh or like the ipad os and the mac side seeing the whole like thing that brings everything together it seems like facetime back in the day it was a lot of fun to be able to call friends uh when video conferencing was still uh relatively new at least for someone in my generation still trying to try it out but it's cool to see especially in the last year the whole sense of community group calls have also become very big for business i think highlighting the the users is also really cool the audio features so it's nice to see that the whole unification of an importance of ecosystem that apple has done not only in facetime but in the different operating systems between platforms as a whole and i think like as a as a tech user who constantly is trying to find the best tools to use both for entertainment and work all the devices are kind of blended in my lifestyle um that's it's all it's all very exciting and we really look forward to the products that are coming out in the future oh well i'm so glad you like it and we you know i mean what makes it all meaningful and worthwhile for us is is when people like you love what we do and so i'm really glad to hear that for sure yeah thanks so much for your time by the way yeah great meeting you hope to see you again sometime so that is the interview with craig and as i said that is a super cool opportunity because after all these years of watching wwdc to be noticed by apple and to be able to check out all the latest and greatest tech products and inform you guys is really the main intention of all of this and to be totally honest you guys know i've been a huge fan of the m1 lineup since it was announced the software side of things has really unified the entire lineup and apple's also focused a lot on features that consumers have been asking for especially in the past couple years i think apple has done a really good job in the m1 lineup and the fact that it is both on the tablets the desktops and eventually maybe even making its way to more mobile devices but it just shows how much power apple's own silicon is and it just shows how much innovation is going to be coming in the future now that apple has full control over their hardware and their software experience to give the consumers the best features possible it was also kind of cool to talk about the desk setup as well and it just goes to show everybody's desk setup is very different and for a lot of people having a shift over to working from home just setting something up that works in the meantime is really nice but on the channel and also on our page eye setups we tried to at least like show some inspiration of setups that you guys kind of build for yourselves as well as the makeover series where we actually went to people's houses and did their setup for them so it was kind of cool to talk about like the personal side of things and the kind of setup that he's gone with but otherwise thank you guys so much for watching this video and if you enjoyed it make sure you drop a like and i'll see you all in the next one [Music] you what's the use in getting an apple pencil if you're not using a lot of the features the apple pencil is a great tool and when i got the first generation pencil with a second generation ipad pro i only used it up to markup documents but since then ipad os has had some upgrades and now there's so much more that you could do with it to really speed up your work make you more productive and save you time most of the tips that i'm going to mention are going to work with both the first generation and the second generation pencils and i'll point out where there are some small differences it's important to note that the devices are not cross compatible so you can't pair the first generation pencil with something like the ipad air 4 or the ipad pro and you can't pair the second generation pencil with the ipad 8. i'll put a compatibility list on the screen for each version and make sure that you get the one that's right for your device all right so let's get to my list of favorite apple pencil tips and tricks to help you get the most out of your apple pencil first i want to cover working with text and scribble the ipad can now recognize your handwriting and convert it into text in notes tap on the pencil icon to show the markup toolbar tap the handwriting tool and then start writing with the apple pencil and scribble will automatically convert your handwriting into typed text if you want to select some text you can double tap on a word to select it or triple tap to select a whole line or paragraph if you're looking to select multiple words you can either draw a line through them or circle them to make the selection they're also going to be times when you need to add or remove space between words simply draw a line between the two words to remove a space or a line between two letters to add a space and once you get used to how this works it becomes second nature the next tip has to do with deleting and adding text to delete a word just scratch it out and you'll see that the ipad immediately removes it if you're looking to add some text touch and hold in a text area and then wait for the gray space to appear now write what you want to add and the space will close around your new text moving on i want to talk about charging the apple pencil the second generation apple pencil can be easily charged wirelessly by attaching it to the ipad itself this is also how you pair the pencil with the ipad the first generation pencil has a lightning port so it can be paired and charged by inserting it into the lightning port on your ipad i'm always worried that someone won't notice and will either grab the pencil or the ipad and damage one or both of the devices and apple does provide a lightning adapter which i think i lost within a week rather than buying another one i bought a female lightning cable which i linked to in the description and now i can just plug the pencil directly into it and i don't have to have a loose adapter on my desk at all time moving on to the next tip you can also copy handwritten notes and then paste them as text first use the selection tool at the bottom and then circle the handwritten notes you want to copy tap on the selection and choose copy as text you can now go to another app or another note hit paste and you'll see the handwritten note was converted into typed text if you're still with me and have gotten value from this video give it a thumbs up it very much helps the video and the channel and it lets me know what kind of content you like so that i can make more of it and if you haven't yet hit the subscribe and notification button next i want to talk about one of the original reasons that i got the apple pencil and that's to mark up screenshots and documents i develop websites for small and medium-sized companies and a lot of times it's just easier to explain something with a small note so what i do is i'll take a screenshot of a website and then add comments right on the image i can quickly point to a design element and show where i'm thinking of moving it into or just add notes about what changes i'm proposing the next tip is one that i didn't think i would use much and i was really surprised at how often it comes in handy using the apple pencil you can compose and add a sketch to an outgoing email just open the mail app and create a new email then hit the drawing icon on the bottom right you'll get a dedicated interface to work with where you have all the tools that you're used to having inside of notes you can sketch out whatever it is you need hit done on the top left when you're finished and then insert drawing and you're good to go another tip which is an absolute necessity now and an incredible time saver is signing documents using the apple pencil this is a tip i mentioned in my ipad tips part 2 video and there are three different ways to accomplish this depending on which app you're using so i'll link to that video at the end i'll show you how it's done in dropbox where you just open the pdf then click on the open with icon and select add text or signature you can now add a signature using the apple pencil place and resize it on the screen and you're good to go i love this interface because it lets me add today's date and my signature is saved for future use so i don't have to add it every time all right moving on i'm all about saving time when i can and even if it's just a few seconds here and there because it makes me feel more productive and it makes my workflow feel smoother when i want to quickly add a note i have my ipad set up to where i can just tap the pencil on the lock screen and it will automatically open a blank note to activate this go to settings scroll down to find notes then scroll all the way down to where you'll find access notes from lock screen you have two options there either always create new note which is what i do or resume from last note which is also a good option if that works better for your workflow once you activate this you can go back to your lock screen tap on it with the pencil and you'll see the notes app open with a blank note and you're ready to start writing next one of the things that i find challenging to do is to create precise lines when i'm drawing now some other apps which i'll get to in a minute allow you to modify the line after it's drawn so you can draw it short and then you can like grab the tip and reposition it or lengthen it and it's less important to get it right the first time but the notes app isn't quite as versatile so if you want to make sure that your lines are precise you can use the ruler just click on it from the markup toolbar and you'll see a ruler appear you can align and rotate it and then use it to draw more precise lines now earlier in the video i talked about charging the apple pencil and the battery life on these little guys is actually really good and they charge very quickly you can get approximately 30 minutes of use after a 15 second charge and a full charge normally takes about 15 minutes now to check the battery on your apple pencil you have a couple of options if you're using the second generation pencil you can just dock it on the top of the ipad and you'll see the battery icon appear with a percentage if you're using the first generation pencil or you don't want to put the second generation pencil away you can add the batteries widget to your home page i have my widgets locked on my home screen so i can always see the battery life of my ipad apple pencil and airpods or airpods pro whenever i'm using my ipad if you don't have the keep on home screen option enabled you can swipe right from the home screen to see the widgets it's possible that you removed the batteries widget from this section so if you don't see it touch and hold any widget until the edit screen appears and then tap the plus icon on the top left scroll down to find the batteries widget and then drag it onto today's view then click done and you're all set now most of the tips i showed so far have been using apps that come with your ipads but there are a ton of other functions for it i use it with different note-taking apps like good notes notability nebo and evernote i also use it with procreate and pretty much every time i use lightroom because it makes it so much easier to do things like tracing an outline or creating a mask if you have questions about any of the apps that i mentioned or even other ones and you want me to cover them in a future video let me know in the comment section remember that i have links in the description to all the products that i talked about hopefully this video was helpful click on my face to subscribe and then watch one of these videos you know what i always say buy it nice or buy it twice good luck and see you soon [Applause] [Music] [Music] thank you good morning and welcome to the Steve Jobs theater we've always believed that by giving people wonderful tools you enabled them

new iPad joins the new ipad mini ipad air and iPad pros all taken further than ever before with iPad OS so that's the news for iPad now back to Tim fakes jaws this new iPad will enable so many more people to experience the power and versatility of iPad now next up let's talk about Apple watch Apple watch puts groundbreaking health fitness and communications capabilities onto the risk of millions and millions of people today Apple watch is everywhere and it's making a difference in so many ways all over the world we hear firsthand everyday about the truly personal and profound impacts that the Apple watch is having on people's lives so we made a video for you this morning to share just some of these stories with you dear mr. Cook dear Apple dear Tim so the run began as usual I was 32 weeks pregnant getting ready to go to bed the next morning I'd have notifications on my watching my phone saying your heart rate is elevating I was like ah that's strange and I run my EKG and it says 220 beats and I'm like something's not right I told my husband like we need to go he was like I'm in the middle of cutting grass and like we need to go and then suddenly I woke up to be abused this is my husband Kyle he's going out to cut the grass when I fell it automatically call 911 cause my wife when I think about what happened and what could have happened once we got to the hospital they realized it was some sort of infection my heart rate was spiking and it was causing the baby's heart rates to get lower and lower so emergency c-section and she was born had surgery it summated that I would have had a heart attack within less than 12 months I mean like I'm like you have goosebumps I don't know if you can see them through like the camera it's crazy it's not something you think of your watch blah saving your life anyway hi in the past I didn't prioritize taking care of myself but now I've gained the ability to be active in ways that I never would've dreamed of all because the computer my wrist told me it was time to fill the rings yeah closing weeks like this little reminder going okay you can do a little better today when I see the little rings of light get your moves in today sometimes it used to be like mind your business Apple watch but then it's like you know what I do need to get my movement I like the idea of achievements that you get for every small things done it has I just reminded me I should stand out by the way to go shoot you to NATO missile early on you stay home and put makeup thank you [Music] he's the blur and that's his nickname as the blur Harrison is on the autism spectrum and he's on the cross-country and track teams here at the school he was having some issues with anxiety and crowd noise the sound of the cheering just there's mail so I paired up my watch with my headphones and the music helps me focus when he started running with music playing it was like seeing a different athlete this moment of triumph goosebumps and tears and cinematic Apple needs to know this happened but you did in your brainstorming sessions came to life and helped save mine dear I just had to tell my story I will be forever grateful I had no idea that one day it would save my life what I want to say is thank you thank you thank you [Music] thank you okay thank you thank you it is it's truly inspiring to see the difference that the Apple watch is making they the hearing these stories really make my heart sing and these are just a few of the amazing stories that I get every day now in addition to helping individuals Apple watch is having an impact on another important area that affects all of us and that is health research we're excited about how Apple watch can make a tremendous difference in this area and to tell you more about it I'd like to invite sümbül to the stage Sumbul what makes the amazing stories you just saw even possible are the incredible capabilities built into Apple watch each one requiring extensive development and research this deep focus on science is the foundation of many of our product features especially the ones focused on health for example the irregular heart rhythm notification was developed from the using the data from the largest study ever focused on atrial fibrillation over 400,000 people participated in the Apple heart study and this showed for the first time that a SmartWatch could help in the early detection of afib it transformed how we look at cardiovascular science we were so encouraged that today we are announcing three new health research studies starting with the Apple hearing study since apple watch is on you all the time and can now measure sound levels in your environment this study will analyze how your daily sound exposure impacts your long-term hearing health for this study we're working with the experts at the University of Michigan and the World Health Organization for our second study we're using the new cycle tracking feature that we introduced in June the Apple women's health study focuses on an area that hasn't received much attention in many years it'll look at how menstrual cycles can inform the screening for important conditions like infertility and osteoporosis for this novel study we're partnering with the Harvard School of Public Health and the NIH finally the apple heart and movement study will look at how metrics from apple watch can serve as early warning signs and help create innovative interventions to improve overall health for this study we're so excited to be partnering with the American Heart Association and the cardiovascular experts at the Brigham and Women's Hospital if you would like to participate in this research and make a contribution to potential medical discoveries you can enroll using the new apple research app where you can enroll perform tasks and view your data of course you decide what data you want to share and with whom Apple cannot access any information that directly identifies you the new apple research app will be available in the US later this year now back to Tim thank you some more we're really excited about the impact the research app can have it gives us all of us an amazing opportunity to participate in health research that could lead to innovations to improve our health and the health of future generations so I hope that you check it out since the beginning innovation has been the core of the Apple watch innovations that really matter to people from the life changing to the potentially life savings many of these technologies were barely imaginable just a few years ago Apple watch has become the most advanced and most loved SmartWatch in the world and to tell you all about what's next with the Apple watch I'd like to invite up Stan in Stan thanks Tim we want to make apple watch even better for all the things you do in place as you go and so today I'm so excited to share with you the next generation of Apple watch [Music] [Music] [Music] introducing Apple watch Series 5 featuring an innovative new display that is always on the new always-on Retina Display Never Sleeps so the watch face is always visible with previous models of Apple watch when you lowered your wrist the display would go completely dark but now with series 5 you always be able to see your time and complications hey risks razor a tap brings everything back to full brightness now the new always-on display is just loaded with advanced technologies so I want to tell you about it it all starts with the industry's only low temperature poly-silicon and oxide display or LTP Oh LTP allows the display to refresh dynamically from as high as 60 Hertz to as low as one Hertz which is extremely power efficient there's also a new low power display driver an ultra efficient power management integrated circuit and a new ambient light sensor which all work seamlessly together by combining this incredible hardware with innovative software we're able to deliver this always-on display while still maintaining the same all-day 18 hour battery life now all of the watch faces have been carefully tuned for the new display so you'll always be able to see your time in your complications we've also optimized the screens for all of the workouts in the workout apps so you'll be able to see your workout metrics without raising your wrist this always on display is perfect for those times when you can't raise your wrist or tap the display or when you're in a social or work setting where you kind of want to just sneak a quick glance at the top right or when you're the middle of a crazy hard workout where a wrist raise just isn't possible the new always on display is gonna be useful for so many different situations throughout the day we can't wait for you to try it next let's talk about another new feature in series 5 a built-in compass now with the updated Maps app you'll be able to see which way you're facing just like on your iPhone you can add the compass to your watch face so you can see your direction at a glance and there's even a new compass app which allows you to see not only your heading but also your latitude longitude current elevation and incline now our developers can take advantage of the compass as well so the direction is always clear when you're hiking with wiki elope paddleboarding with goes up or searching out the constellations with night sky next let's talk about safety features Apple watch has some important safety features built right in like fall detection emergency SOS medical ID now emergency SOS could be life-saving should you ever need it and so we wanted to make it even more capable now with series 5 every cellular model has international emergency calling so you can call emergency services in over a hundred and fifty countries around the world just by pressing and holding down the side button even without your iPhone we think this will give you great peace of mind if you ever travel internationally next another important benefit of Apple watch is being able to express your personal style and Series five has the widest assortment of case finishes ever aluminum models come in silver gold and Space Gray and now the cases are made from a hundred percent recycled aluminum stainless-steel models come in gold space black and polished and were introducing new models for the first time in titanium this natural brushed titanium maintained his color through a special surface treatment than Apple custom engineered and there's also a second model in titanium in this brush space black with a diamond light coating Sears five will be available in ceramic as well in this brilliant white color really beautiful there are new Apple watch Nike models featuring new Nike sport band's new reflective sport loops and cool new Nike watch faces and there are new Hermes models in these beautiful color block bands with a classic or mass print aren't they cool this year we're also introducing Hermes models in black featuring space black stainless steel cases featuring handcraft noir leather bands these are just stunning of course every Apple watch is designed and manufactured in the most environmentally friendly way possible we're so excited about Apple watch Series 5 with its always-on display compass international emergency calling and all the other great features like its swim proof you can take an ECG fall detection Apple pay all the new features of watch the what six it truly is the most capable Apple watch ever series five GPS models will start at just three ninety-nine and $4.99 for cellular models you'll be able to order series five starting today right after the keynote and they'll be available in our stores starting September 20th we're also keeping the very popular series three in the line series three is a great watch it has GPS heart rate sensor it's swim proof the new features of watch illah six and now starting at a low price of just $1.99 and that's Apple watch thank you back to you Tim Thank You Stan I'm really excited about this new Apple watch lineup and with all of the new amazing features Apple watch is going to enable you to do even more than before we created a fun video to demonstrate just this I'd love to play it for you now this watch tells time and takes phone calls this watch tells time and turns on lights and opens up doors this watch tells time and communicates with satellites twelve thousand four hundred and twenty seven miles above the earth it wakes you up and gets you onto subways and place every Elton John studio album hey Siri play tumbleweed connection ever recorded play goodbye yellow brick road say madman across the window this watch tells time and sets timers and set your pace and warns you when it's too loud and text your friends and opens portals kidding and tracks your distance underwater and starts competitions and accepts challenges and tracks your workouts and tells you which direction you should be going and reminds you to breathe and has an app that measures the exact timing of the electrical waves traveling through the upper and lower chambers of your heart otherwise known as an electrocardiogram so in conclusion just to reiterate this watch tells time I love that video I love that video it really helps you understand so many of the amazing things that the watch can do next up let's talk about iPhone iPhone in the incredible capabilities that it puts into people's hands has changed the way we live our lives in ways that we never could have imagined it's become so essential for hundreds and hundreds of millions of people all over the world it's changed industries and led to the creation of entirely new ones and it's made a profound impact on all of our daily lives customers love I phone and we keep striving to make it better and better last year we launched three incredible iPhones the iPhone 10 R became the most popular iPhone and the most popular smartphone in the world we also launched the iPhone 10 s and the iPhone 10 s max the most advanced iPhones we have ever created these three iPhones together have a combined 99% customer satisfaction this is the highest in the industry really unbelievable customers love I phone because we focus on technologies that matter most in their lives today I am thrilled to share with you the newest iPhone [Applause] [Music] [Music] this is iPhone 11 the next generation of iPhone and it is jam-packed with great new capabilities in an incredible new design to tell you all about iPhone 11 I'd like to invite Cayenne to the stage pan Thank You Tim the innovations an iPhone 11 are truly remarkable and that starts with a design iPhone 11 has a beautiful anodized aluminum and glass design and that glass it's a toughest ever in a smartphone on the front and back in the glass it surrounds the camera has a sculpted 3d geometry and it was precision milled down from a single piece of glass to achieve this elegant look iPhone 11 comes in six new colors with an all-new purple white yellow green black and product red it has a 6.1 inch liquid Retina display with true tone white color tapped awake and haptic touch in even more places with Iowa's 13 like contextual menus now videos are wonderful to watch on this display and now we have spatial audio which provides an immersive theater like experience by creating a sound field around you using an apple design virtualizer and we support Dolby Atmos for an incredible sound experience now let's talk about camera iPhone is the world's most popular camera and it gets even better with iPhone 11 we have an amazing dual camera system with an all-new wide camera with a new sensor with a hundred percent focused pixels for faster autofocus three times faster and low-light and we have a new ultra wide camera with a hundred and twenty degree field of view this will let you capture way more in your photos and videos because now you can take a wide camera shot like this but switch to the ultra wide to reveal the so now see the beautiful framing my mother nature but the details still are there in the sky the rocks in the sand this is doing an optical zoom out to X so you can capture way more without moving so now when you're taking a wide camera shot you'll see our new immersive camera interface but lets you see outside the frame hinting at a bigger shot then you can simply tap to switch to the ultra wide revealing more of your scene this is great for these epic landscape shots where you can see edge to edge all this detail and it's also great for tight spaces where you can't physically back up but the ultra wide lets you do that revealing more of your story you can use an angle like this to take a heroic and dynamic shot because the ultra wide can elongate your subject it keep all these details sharp from her red dress all the way to her face now these are some examples of great ultra wide photos we've also updated our image pipeline which processes over a trillion operations per photo and it's got our image signal processor and it has our neural Engine for machine learning and now we've added semantic rendering this allows us to more intelligently detect subjects and relight them with detail so they look even better now we use this across your photos including in our next-gen smart HDR you can see the gorgeous smile in her warm face accentuated by the backlit Sun now we're using multi scale tone mapping so we can treat highlights differently in different parts of the image depending on what's best for them now it works here in portrait mode and people love taking portraits on iPhone 11 and either 11 has this wide-angle camera so you can take these beautiful wide shots of portraits for people but now with two cameras we have stereoscopic depth so now you can also take portraits of your favorite pets and you can also use creative depth-of-field for shots like this now we have a new portrait lighting effect and that's Heike mono you can take a stunning studio quality portrait like this from a pretty ordinary background alright let's talk about night mode this is for those very low-light environments like outdoors at night or inside a dimly lit restaurant and night mode comes on automatically when it's dark enough to brighten photos and reduce noise here's an image with night mode turned off here it is with night mode turn on we determined the image fusion time and use adaptive bracketing based on what we see in preview so shorter frames if you have subject motion or longer frames if you have deep shadows to recover them then we intelligently fuse images together reducing motion and blur all right we know you love taking videos and you're capturing more than ever an iPhone so I'm really excited to show you the first video shot on iphone 11 entirely on our wide and ultra wide cameras [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so the quality is just astounding that was shot in 4k resolution and all the shots including the ones overhead or handheld so it's making use of our even better cinematic video stabilization so in taking video you can easily tap to switch to the ultra wide camera to capture even more on your scene you can also use the zoom wheel to just transition easily between the two cameras now we make it great to capture in all the formats you love because we support 4k resolution up to 60 frames per second slow-mo time-lapse cinematic video stabilization and now extended dynamic range at 4k up to 60 frames per second and this is across both cameras which is pretty cool we also wanted to make it easier for you to take a quick video with quick take so now when you're taking photos and you decide you want to take a quick video simply tap and hold the shutter button to record a video you can do that without changing frames so video really shines on iPhone 11 in fact it has the highest quality video ever in a smartphone this is enabled by a real time processing across our camera hardware our software our video encoders and our chip so that's the amazing dual camera system on iPhone 11 with their new wide and ultra wide 4 2 X optical zoom out night mode a brighter flash next gen smart HDR and the highest quality video it will change the way you take your photos and videos we've also updated our front a true depth camera to a wider 12 megapixel sensor so now you can still take your 7 megapixel selfies as you normally would but simply rotate to landscape to capture even more people using that wider sensor also on the front camera we've added 4k video with extended dynamic range up to 30 frames per second and you can also capture on the front at 4k 60 as well now we've also added slow-motion video to the front camera for the first time now we think this is going to be really fun it's so fun that we created a little ad about it and we couldn't resist showing you [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay so we want this to inspire you to go take some awesome slow fees because we can't wait too soon all right now so much of our great camera is also enabled by performance and iPhone 11 has leading performance for your everyday to the most demanding tasks in fact our Apple design chips have led the industry for many years Ben says the a12 is so far ahead of the industry that it will still be competitive with the best Android smartphones in two years well now we're introducing the a13 Bionic the next generation of our industry-leading chip so if you look at CPU performance with the iPhone 10 hours a 12 Y onic chip it still leads the pack in terms of the latest smartphones and chips well the a 13 Bionic is just going to extend that leave even further the a 13 is the fastest CPU ever in a smartphone and that's great because everything you do every day from morning till night makes use of the chip so what about graphics well if you look at the a12 still leading the pack in GPU performance and the a13 Bionic is just going to get even faster because the a13 Bionic is also the fastest GPU ever in the car and to show you more about that because this is great for mobile gaming I'd like to introduce giant Network they are the force behind some of the most popular mobile games in China and now with their studio tips works they're preparing to release their first global title it's called Pascal's wager and I'd like to introduce yang Yang the founder of tips works thank you we have been working on in exciting action wrapping gear let's take a look past Casa wager it's a dark fantasy action game your take on a journey through a messy for world the game happens in a place that you're surrounded by internal darkness and a few minutes must make a pass by state blow to joints does illuminate you will notice the fantastical creatures which look amazing with meta to shaders please can select the one of four characters and can change throughout to use different skills now we will change it to Bonita whose powerful web can take out enemies middle engine we spent hours of recruiting the perfect sounds of footsteps change and even blade slashing details are clear with the iPhone spatial audience let's watch a spenita fight this monster [Applause] so we trailed albo we see the benefits of hunter processing effects including anti aliasing and bloom which are only possible with a GPU of the new iPhone of this with an incredible 60 frames-per-second of smooth performance which comes in handy as we keep evil at bay speaking of evil our hero could use some help we don't want to spoil anything this is a preview of Pascal's wager pre-order exclusively on the App Store next month thank you so I just have to say how remarkable it is that a game like that with those kinds of phenomenal graphics can run on a small and powerful chip in the palm of your hand a 13 Bionic so just kudos to that and our incredible silicon engineers we can't wait to see Pascal's wager and what else other developers will come up with with the a13 all right so battery we know that battery life is really important to customers and last year with the iPhone 10 are we already have the longest battery life in an iPhone ever and it was a big leap and our customers loved it so with the advancements in iPhone 11 it'll still have an hour more and vim battery that your iPhone 10 R 4 the advances in iPhone 11 really touch areas that customers experience every day this is innovation that matters powerful dual camera system night mode and things we didn't even have time to talk about like faster face ID water and dust resistance wireless charging Wi-Fi six and more we think customers will love iPhone 11 and we've created a really fun video all about it [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] i phone 11 offer so much meaningful innovation and we want even more people to experience it so we're really excited to offer iPhone 11 at just $6.99 we think this is an amazing phone that everyone will love thank you and now back to Tim Thank You Cayenne the new iPhone 11 is simply amazing we designed it with our customers in mind and it will impact their lives in meaningful ways every day but we didn't stop there for our customers that want the most sophisticated technology that really pushes the limits we've created something truly special and I'm thrilled to introduce it to you now [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] this is the iPhone 11 Pro and these are the most powerful and most advanced iPhones that we have ever built in a stunning new design I'd like to invite Phil up to tell you all about them Phil thank you Tim and good morning everyone how you doing out there but this is the first phone that we've called pro and for us that means it's a device that pros can count on to get their work done but it's also product for all of us who want simply the best product made even if we're not a pro so let's talk all about it we'll start with this incredible stunning new pro design this is the most advanced and detailed iPhone we've made yet it's made of a surgical grade stainless steel that back is a single piece of machine glass with an optical PVD coating there's a beautiful new mat textured finish that looks great and feels awesome in your hand iPhone 11 pro comes in some gorgeous new finishes this is an all-new midnight green there's a very pro Space Gray a beautiful silver and a new gold these are incredible all right let's talk about this pro display it comes in two sizes five point eight inches and 6.5 inches they have the highest pixel density of any display Apple makes our super Retina display is the most advanced we've ever built into an iPhone it's a new OLED panel that has 2 million to 1 contrast ratio P three-wide color true tone have to touch and now a much brighter up to 1200 nits that's incredibly bright while also being 15% more energy-efficient now this incredible new display has a love of a brightness contrast ratio color in detail well really it's the experience that we're building into the new display for the Mac Pro we call that the pro display XDR and now that experience is being built into an iPhone in addition to that it has the spatial audio sound the Cayenne told you about as HDR 10 we vision dolby atmos so we decide it's worthy of a new name we call it the super retina xD our display alright let's talk about performance a pro level performance as you know our a series chips have kept Apple ahead of the industry for years now and the a13 Bionic is going to extend that lead well to tell you even more about the a13 Bionic I'm really excited to bring up three some phantom is our vice president of silicon engineering sri thank you hello everyone our engineering team at Apple has been designing chips for iPhone for over a decade and today I'm excited to talk to you about eight 13 Bionic our latest creation and we have touched everything now at Apple we have the benefit of owning the entire vertical stack the software the system hardware and the chip design and we work together to optimize every block on the chip all the way from the transistor up through the package design to work efficiently for iOS and iPhone we've touched so many things that improve so many things in the 813 Bionic but today I'd like to talk to you about two specific improvements machine learning and low-power design first machine learning we use machine learning all throughout iPhone and in our chips our CPU GPU and neural engine are all optimized for different types of machine learning workloads and in a 13 Bionic we made them all faster 4ml particularly the cpu it we added brand new machine learning accelerators in our CPUs these accelerators are built on matrix multiplication very fast that's an operation that's used frequently in ml computation these dedicated accelerators allow the CP to process matrix math operations up to 6x faster making the CPU capable of over one trillion operations per second now as developers experiment on the bleeding edge of ml the CPU can accelerate these nascent evolving models in addition the chip works our latest generation of the Apple Design machine learning controller so that ml models can be automatically and seamlessly scheduled on the CPU GPU and neural engine balancing efficiency and performance together with iPhone 11 Pro this creates a fully integrated platform where developers can do some incredible things like natural language processing image classification in photos and videos and character animation and people occlusion in AR apps all of this makes i phone 11 pro the best machine learning platform in any smartphone the second thing I'd like to talk to you today about is how we lowered the power of the a13 Bionic it is our most efficient chip today and here are a few reasons why first it starts with the transistors the fundamental building blocks of our chips and 8:13 Bionic uses an advanced improved 2nd generation 7 nanometer transistor the most advanced in the industry and we carefully tailored each transistor for high performance and low power and we did this with over eight and a half billion transistors that's the most we've ever put into any iPhone chip but it's not just a sheer volume of transistors to get both high performance and low power you need great architecture one example of that is our hot apple architected high-efficiency CPU cores these cores are the most efficient place to run lightweight tasks and powerful enough to use most of the time giving you great battery life finally at the design level we apply many many low-power design techniques to increase the efficiency of our design for example we have hundreds of voltage domains on the chip so we light up only the sections of the chip that need to function at any given time but that's not all we have hundreds of thousands of got caught gating domains so we only turn on the smallest amount of logic in the chip dramatically reducing power the result is our highest performing highest performing most efficient design ever all of our core CPU GPU and ural engine are all up to 20 percent faster in addition at the same time as we move performance up for those applications and tasks that don't need more performance in the a 12 we were able to reduce the power of all our engines for example or GPU by up to 40% all of this translates to great performance and battery life for our customers and in addition combined to the thermal design of the iPhone 11 Pro we have our best sustained performance ever and that's 813 bionic it is our most efficient most performant chip we have ever built for iPhone we can't wait for our customers and developers succeed in action thank you and back to film well thank you three so what is our team done to help the battery keep up with this incredible level of pro performance we are so excited to tell you that with iPhone 11 Pro you now get up to four hours longer in your day with iPhone 11 Pro max up to five hours longer their day we're also including our fast charge 18 watt adapter in the box you can charge them all faster too so I know I know what you're waiting for I am too let's talk about the cameras now question my favorite part about iPhone this is the first iPhone that we've had a camera system that we call pro it's really worthy of this name so what does it have first it has a new wide camera that has a fast F 1.8 aperture and focus pixels to cover a hundred percent of the sensor it is a new telephoto camera with a larger F 2.0 aperture it lets in 40% more light and has a new ultra wide camera with a super wide 120 degree field of view and a tremendous range of focus across the entire image now all these work together with the a13 Bionic chip and its new generation image signal processor and that enables a whole new level of photography pro photography and you're just going to love it so let's let's go to one that some of the things that does first with the telephoto camera and the ultra wide do the ability to zoom in two times and zoom out two times that's a 4x optical zoom range with these three cameras you have incredible creative control so for example you can use the telephoto and getting close on your subject to really zoom in on it or you can use the wide to tell bit more of a story or you can pull all the way out to the ultra wide and reveal the full surroundings you can take all three shots from one vantage point now we've given iphone 11pro to some pro photographers to use to see what they can do with this incredible new camera system and first they absolutely love it and they are excited to share with you some of the photos they've taken so we've picked from all the incredible shots they've taken six we're gonna go through six shots that pros have taken to show you some of the different cameras and what's possible and they're just stunning and here's a perfect one to start with look at this image it is shot with the wide camera shot by Jordy wood shot it in a perfect named place for this photo Picabo Canyon and Kanab Utah that's just the awesome name for this look at the eye the detail in the eye the it's the details in the eyelashes the incredible skin tones this is a great photo show the power of this new camera system here's another shot very different kind of shot also taken with that wide camera this was shot by Jake Michaels in LA you can see caught a moment frozen in time the fast shutter speed and capture the light just bouncing off those frozen water droplets and it uses our black and white pro level image filter which gives incredible tonal grayscale to it all right now let's switch over the telephoto is an incredible shot taken by Francesca Alan out in Malibu just the incredible image clarity stunning environment skin tones are beautiful shot by the natural light and that's just the natural depth of field of that aperture with F 1.8 F 2.0 it is amazing and the Blues of the sky in the water just stunning so now let's look at a portrait mode shot of the telephoto camera it's very different than than than what you would take this is backlit a backlit portrait mode telephoto shot by Jeff Jake Michaels and you just see the incredible silhouette but so much detail in the hair look at the blue and gold backlit just such vibrant colors a stunning image all right now let's look at a photo taken with our new ultra wide camera Jake Michaels took this down in Venice Beach over a skateboard park how did you take this got up on a cherry picker 50 feet above the ground I think many of us would would be a little nervous doing that but for us he did it took a shot down with the wide-angle the super wide camera just see this incredible abstract image looks stunning the focus is incredible because of the depth of focus of that camera all right one more example this is shot with the ultra wide by Kiara's Anka shot this in Arizona see this amazing contrast between the lights and the darks and mid-tones the sky the landscape is just surreal this is just this otherworldly kind of shot that we'd all love to get so those are six examples of photos using the three cameras there what pros can do if you put it in their hands with their incredible talent it's amazing stuff well now what we want to do yep now we want to give you a sneak peak of a new feature coming in the camera that will be available with the software update this fall but it's so cool we have to tell you about it it's using the knurl engine of the a13 Bionic to create a whole brand-new kind of image processing system we call it deep fusion and this is so cool so that to tell you what it's doing when you do that while we look at an image so this is a photo that was shot on an iPhone 11 pro using this deep fusion technology and this kind of an image would not have been possible for we use machine learning to take this photo and low to medium light and it's unlike anything possible with the iPhone camera before so what what is it doing how do we get an image like this all right you ready for this what it does it shoots nine images before you press the shutter button it's already shot for short images for secondary images when you press the shutter button it takes one long exposure and then in just one second the knurl engine analyzes the fuse combination of long and short images picking the best among them selecting all the pixels and pixel by pixel going through 24 million pixels to optimize for detail and low noise like you see on the sweater there it is amazing this is the first time a neural engine is responsible for generating the output image it is computational photography mad science this way all right now let's talk about video iPhone 11 Pro is a powerful new video camera system all three cameras shoot 4k 60 frame a second extended dynamic range video with beautiful highlights and shadow details so of course we gave iPhone 11 Pro to a professional cinematographer and director and asked them to take it to a back lot in LA shoot something and show us all what's possible with this brand new camera system and that's what we want to show you now [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] that incredible that was not always shot but also edited entirely an iPhone 11 pro by director of photography Guillermo Garza and director at Diego Contreras thank you guys that is just stunning video and the team works hard to make sure that you can get consistent image capture across all three video cameras we actually paired the three cameras right at the factory calibrating them for color and exposure and then all the time while you're using them we actually do some smart things like we in real time take data from the camera you're shooting with and prime the other cameras automatically for auto focus auto exposure color temperature even tone mapping so you can get a smooth transition across all three cameras while we minimize any shifts in color or exposure and for pros who want to edit this video quickly on device now with iOS 13 we have new advanced video editing features built into the Photos app so you can do things like edit a video for exposure color temperature even cropping and scaling right in the palm of your hands so this is the new camera system in iPhone 11 Pro we think pros are gonna love it we're all gonna love it it is incredible new wide ultra wide telephoto cameras a highest quality video ever four times optical zoom new smarter HDR new night mode on and on it is an incredibly we even have reach designed the camera out there's a new font in it called SF camera it is so pro you're gonna love using it now on top of all of this iPhone 11 Pro it's really the only pro camera with a native app ecosystem there's App Store has over 50 over 30 thousand photo and video app so you can do just about anything can imagine right on device so a great example of this is filmic they make a great app called filmic Pro that makes it possible for award-winning directors to push the boundaries of what's possible with cinematic filmmaking on iphone so we're really honored to invite up their CTO Christopher Cohen and along with them director of acclaimed films the Florida Project and tangerine the first theatrical trailer shot entirely on iPhone Shaun Baker welcome guys I shot tangerine on iphone using filmic Pro and I've been working closely with Chris and the filmic team ever since now every shot has the right lens as a filmmaker it's my job to figure out which lens that is unset I use a tool called the directors viewfinder it helps me find a frame and choose focal length filmmakers have been doing it like this for nearly 75 years but what if you could use what we're all going to have in our pockets we're delighted to preview the next version of filmic Pro it's gonna move filmmaking forward let's take a look at the next generation of lens selection we've divided the viewfinder into individual feeds visualizing every field of view available on the new iPhone with the new a 13 and the higher sustained performance of the new iPhone you can shoot with our most complex capture pipeline up to five times longer than before but now you can shoot with multiple cameras at the same time giving filmmakers even more options and I love that because it's totally transformative with two cameras rolling in filmic Pro I get twice as much coverage on the same take reducing my number of takes and giving me more options in post to facilitate that we employ a compound overlay representing the primary and secondary cameras while both are being recorded simultaneously I can focus in on my akin to compose or back up to see my widest field of view I'm always excited when I see evolution in filmmaking style and craft and this multicam feature will give me new creative options for covering scenes such as how I would approach the traditional shot reverse shots right Sean we can even couple this incredible ultra wide camera with the front-facing camera this enables me to capture the organic and intimate interaction between two individuals in one unbroken take with a single unobtrusive device so I can literally take the audience and slap them right in the middle of a conversation it's not only incredible for narrative storytelling it will be wonderful for documentaries and journalism as well the ability to record multiple videos this amazing sustained performance and this incredible ultra wide lens it's all in one device it's going to change this industry the all-new filmic pro will be available later this year only in the App Store thank you Thank You Christopher and Shawn so this is iPhone 11 Pro in addition to the triple camera system a 13 Bionic longer battery

every day and just like last year's wwdc this entire conference will be made available for free we've got a lot of exciting news and breakthrough innovations to share with you today so let's get started by turning it over to craig to tell us what's new in ios thanks tim all right let's dive right in for many of us our iphone has become indispensable and at the heart of iphone is ios ios powers experiences we've come to rely on and this year we were inspired to create even more meaningful ways iphone could help you our new release is ios 15. it's packed with features that make the ios experience adapt to and complement the way you use iphone whether it's staying connected with those who matter to you most finding the space to focus without distraction using intelligence to discover the information you need or exploring the world around you let's start off with features that will let you stay connected in brand new ways in a year when figuring out how to get face to face has felt more essential than ever we've all found ourselves using video calling for just about everything and when it comes to making calls that are easy spontaneous and connect us with the people who matter most face time is a standout with its incredibly intuitive design and end-to-end encryption since day one facetime is how we catch up with friends around the world and how we stay close to family members when we're apart enjoying these deeply personal moments over video can bring so much joy but it also has its challenges when talking in person our brains process hundreds of social auditory and visual cues when talking on a video call many of those signals can get lost leaving us feeling drained so this year we've set out to make facetime calls feel more natural comfortable and lifelike first is a feature that makes facetime calls sound like you're sitting in the very same room we're bringing spatial audio to facetime creating a sound field that helps conversations flow as easily as they do face to face now your friends voices are spread out to sound like they're coming from the direction in which their position on the video call making your calls more comfortable and more natural next let's talk about two powerful new options for your microphone the first is voice isolation when you're on a facetime call your mic is picking up a cacophony of sound so in voice isolation machine learning distinguishes these sounds blocks out the ambient noise and prioritizes your voice so that it comes through crystal clear check it out i wish i could be there me too let me fix this better right yeah she wanted for her birthday sometimes though we want every bit of sound to come through and that's when you switch to wide spectrum in wide spectrum your mic picks up an entire symphony's worth of sound your voice and everything around you next let's turn to video when you want to see every face in the room you can now turn on grid view giving you another way to view your group facetime calls here you see people in the same size tiles and you'll be able to clearly identify who's speaking while seeing everyone else's reactions and to make your facetime video capture more beautiful than ever we're introducing portrait mode where we've taken inspiration from iphone stunning portrait photos in facetime portrait mode blurs the background and naturally puts the focus on you next to help you schedule your facetime calls we've created facetime links now you can generate a link for a facetime call and share it anywhere it's a terrific way to plan ahead for a call you can send the facetime link in places like messages email whatsapp or jump into calendar and make an event for your facetime call so everyone will know exactly where to meet and when and it's not just apple devices that can use a facetime link to join your call your friends with android and windows devices can use your facetime link to join the call right from their browser and even on the web facetime calls are still end and encrypted so your privacy is never compromised some of our favorite ways to connect involve more than just talking like getting together for a weekly movie night or listening to an album with friend brings back amazing memories we love enjoying shared experiences and so we built share play share play is a powerful new set of features for shared experiences that you can enjoy when you're on a facetime call with share play you can bring music into your call for a shared listening experience unlike any other watch movies and tv shows while having rich real time connection with your friends and share your screen giving you limitless possibilities for bringing apps right into your facetime calls let me show you how this works starting with listening together say you're hanging out on a facetime talking about a new album that came out over the weekend with share play you can bring that album right into the conversation when you're on a call all you need to do is press play in apple music and you can choose to listen together and like magic high quality music playback will start in sync for everyone on the call and you're still connected with facetime while listening everyone on the call can add songs to a shared queue and shared playback controls let anyone press play pause or jump to the next track now let's check out what it's like to watch together when you're on a facetime call jump to a streaming app and press play and boom you and your friends are watching the same video totally in sync shareplay is unlike any other shared content experience out there because it moves fluidly throughout the whole system maybe you want to order takeout while you watch picture in picture lets you see your friends and the video you're enjoying together and controls are always accessible with just a tab if the group wants to stay connected with no interruptions to the video sound you can jump into messages and keep the conversation going there and when the moment calls for a bigger screen you can extend the video to your apple tv and watch it there while sharing the moment with your friends over face time on your iphone even when you're using share play across multiple devices everyone will remain in sync we wanted to make sure you have a ton of incredible experiences to share in facetime so in addition to apple music and the tv app shareplay is designed to work with your other favorite apps and streaming services with an api built for easy adoption developers can bring their own apps right into facetime and today we're so pleased to announce that we're already working with some incredible partners watch blockbuster movies with your friends on disney plus and hit tv shows on hulu catch originals from hbo max and see your friends react live to a buzzer beater in the nba app or a speed run on twitch jump on tick tock to watch the funniest videos of the week learn a new skill with a friend on masterclass and so much more finally check out screen sharing you can use it to browse zillow listings live with your future roommates or show off a tricky move in your favorite game screen sharing is also a simple and super effective way to help someone out and answer questions right in the moment and it works across apple devices so that's share play a whole new way in facetime to connect and share experiences with the people you love next when it comes to staying connected throughout the day our go-to is messages and these days so many of our conversations are inspired through sharing articles photos and more so this year we're introducing great new ways to enjoy all of this amazing shared content and the exchanges that follow here's mindy to show you how it all works thanks craig i'm so excited to show you what's new in messages let's check out my family's conversation everyone's sending me pictures from our fun trip down to joshua tree look at this brand new collage design in this cool stack with even more photos from taylor i can quickly swipe through them tap to view the full bunch and even add a quick tap back now let's see what's going on with my friends they're always sending me all kinds of things like this fun playlist from leah and this mission critical article from casey about what type of pizza is best the thing is the time when i receive this great content is often different than when i'm ready to enjoy it for example i'm not going to read this right now but i'd love to the next time i catch up on the news let me show you something we designed just for that called shared with you so now if i head over to the news app there's a new shared with you section that conveniently surfaces that pizza article and a few from my other friends now that i'm ready to learn more i can take a look and check this out up top it shows me who it's from and i can tap from casey to pick up our conversation and remind her that deep dish is obviously the best kind of pizza and then get right back to browsing so now if i want to check out that playlist leah sent earlier i can head over to apple music and it's right here let's take a listen [Music] love it definitely adding this one to my library now one i really love is photos remember those great pictures from my family's trip to joshua tree well over in the photos app the new shared with you section makes it super easy to get back to them they'll also appear in my featured photos and memories and what's really cool is they're automatically brought over to my library too so if i scroll back to that joshua tree trip and drill in you can see all the great photos my cousins sent are right here with the ones i took making my collection so much more complete with zero effort and photos are smart enough to only bring over the ones i actually care about like the ones i was there for so i don't have to worry about screenshots or memes cluttering up my library so that's sharing in ios 15. back to you craig in addition to photos apple music and news we've built shared with you into safari apple podcasts and the apple tv app and if something especially important comes through you can quickly pin it and it'll be elevated and shared with you and places like search so that's messages we shared with you bringing connection to the places you love to enjoy content together with share play and other powerful updates to facetime we're giving you even more meaningful ways to connect of course that means making the time for it so we have new tools to help you focus on what matters most today iphone plays so many roles in our lives it's where we get information how people reach us and where we get things done this is great but it means our attention is being pulled in so many different directions and finding that balance between work and life can be tricky we want to free up space to focus and help you be in the moment and that starts with notifications they have a fresh new look contact photos for people and larger icons for apps making them even easier to identify notifications are useful so they can pile up throughout the course of a day breaking your focus in those moments when you're trying to get in the zone and the truth is while some notifications require your immediate attention others could be dealt with later to help you engage on your own time we're introducing the notification summary a helpful collection of your notifications you can schedule to be delivered at any time you choose like in the morning and evening we use on-device intelligence based on how you interact with your apps to arrange the summary so it's easy to quickly catch up notifications in the summary are ordered by priority with the most relevant ones rising to the top notifications from people will not end up in the summary so you won't miss important messages as they come in if now really isn't a good time you can use do not disturb to silence all notifications and it turns out it's even easier to step away in focus if people know we're busy so we created an easy way to signal to others when you're doing that now when you're using do not disturb your status is automatically displayed in messages when you reach out to someone who's indicated they don't want to be disturbed you'll be reminded in that moment and for truly urgent messages there's a way to get through while an important part of finding focus is about reducing distraction from others it's also about drawing boundaries for yourself there may be periods in your day when you want to be totally focused on work or maybe you just want to be fully present with your family at dinner in these moments you can use do not disturb or strike more of a balance with focus focus is a new way to match your device to your current mindset with focus all you have to do is choose what you want to focus on you can carve out time in your day for work or your personal life when setting up a focus we use on-device intelligence about your past activity to suggest apps and people to allow notifications from so if you're at work you could choose to only be notified by co-workers or apps like mail calendar or slack you can even dedicate a page on your home screen to match your focus and organize your apps and widgets in a way that reduces temptations by making only your work apps visible for your personal life we'll suggest being notified only by friends and family or apps like calm and for a home screen to match you can have your favorite entertainment apps like youtube or widgets for keeping up with your friends and family we'll even intelligently suggest using a focus based on your context using different signals like location or time of day of course you can create a custom focus too and when you use a focus on one device it automatically sets on all your other devices we think together these tools are a really powerful way to help you find balance not only does ios give you space to focus it also uses intelligence to elevate your experience helping you discover more in your photos quickly find what you're looking for and even relive special moments let's get started with a feature we call live text today our photos are full of rich and useful information from photos of places we visit to hand written notes of family recipes and now live text unlocks this information in a way that's really natural it starts with the camera let me show you let's say i just finished a meeting with the team and i want to capture my notes from the whiteboard i can now just point the camera at the whiteboard and an indicator appears here in the lower right when i tap it the text just jumps right out i can use my normal text selection gestures just drag and copy now i can switch over to mail and paste those in and then send this off to tim how cool is that and this is great for photos already in your photo library here's a photo of a friend you may notice that here at the top there's some text now i can just select it like this and i have the option to use lookup to find out more about this restaurant and even look up its location oh and here's a picture from a friend now you may notice here in the background is a phone number i can just zoom in and with live text it's recognized with a link i can just tap it and give this place a call just like that hi wanderless creamery oh uh whoops sorry uh just applying a deep neural network here to a photo of your shop no actual need for ice cream at this time uh gotta drop bye live text works with photos across the entire system including screenshots quick look and even photos on the web and it understands seven languages including simplified and traditional chinese and works across iphone ipad and mac and it's not just text you can also look up information on recognized objects and scenes just tap and you can look up information like the breed of a dog or type of a flower and this works for art books nature pets and landmarks we're also making it easier to search for your photos by adding photos to spotlight spotlight is the universal place to start all of your searches now with photo search and spotlight you can quickly find your photos right from the home screen spotlight leverages intelligence from the photos app so you can search by people scenes elements in your photos or a location like san francisco and leveraging live text spotlight can even find text in your photos which is great when you're looking for a photo of a recipe a receipt or even a handwritten note we've also added all new rich results for contacts you'll have quick access to call text facetime or email them and spotlight intelligently includes everything related to them their location is shared through find my recent conversations shared photos calendar appointments notes and files and we've added all new rich results for actors musicians tv shows and movies as well that's spotlight next let's talk about how photos uses its deep understanding of what's in your library to enable powerful emotional features like memories memories intelligently curates your favorite moments stitching photos and videos together into heartfelt movies to take a closer look at what's new here's chelsea thanks craig this year we've got the biggest update ever including bringing apple music into your memories for the first time let me show you

relevant personalized song from apple music that brings the memory to life [Applause] [Music] these new memories are built on the fly they're interactive and alive and our pace to the beat of the music i can touch and hold to pause and the music continues to play when i let go the pacing adjusts to get back on beat and to see a photo again all it takes is a swipe to customize my memory i'll use a new feature called memory mixes i can tap to bring up the controls then tap this button to jump in swiping on this carousel lets me try out different mixes with intelligently chosen songs pacing and a look to match notice how the feel of the memory changed with a calmer song slower transitions and a black and white look [Music] this faster song has a more energetic feel and these looks aren't just filters we analyze each photo and apply consistent color and contrast just like a colorist at a film studio to check out more intelligent song suggestions i'll tap on the music button you'll notice these top suggestions are a great fit for my climbing memory with tens of millions of songs in the apple music library experts have curated sets of songs that are combined with my music tastes and the knowledge of what's in my photos to create personalized recommendations just for me i can search for a specific song by tapping on the magnifying glass but i'm gonna go with something from my listening history this song from imagine dragons will be [Music] perfect [Music] and i can keep watching related memories personalized with my favorite songs from apple music and now back to craig

maps apple maps is the best way to navigate your world it's easy to use and beautifully designed while providing the confidence that your privacy is protected here's meg to tell you more [Music] two years ago we started rolling out our new map offering richer details and more accurate navigation to help you get around built from the ground up we've launched our new map so far in the us uk ireland and canada and we're excited to announce we're bringing the new map today to spain and portugal and later this year we'll add italy and australia our goal has always been to build the world's best map so we looked at everything we've done so far and asked ourselves how can we push things even further we started by building a gorgeous interactive globe that invites users to tap and explore this is a whole new way of looking at the world but it's in cities where we're taking apple maps to an entirely new level our current map is great and our users have told us it's a lot more useful for navigation and exploration but in ios 15 maps will offer incredible new details for commercial districts marinas buildings and so much more we've added things like elevation new road colors and labels as well as hundreds of custom designed landmarks for places like coit tower and the golden gate bridge and we built a beautiful new nighttime mode with a moonlit glow we think all of these improvements are going to make exploring a city so much fun for maps users and when a user is ready to go somewhere maps on ios 15 will make getting there way better let's start with driving we've added a great deal of new road details to the map so we can help drivers as they move throughout a city to better see and understand important things like turn lanes medians bus and taxi lanes and more this outstanding attention to detail including the addition of crosswalks and bike lanes will help drivers more safely navigate complex intersections and when driving on highways maps now renders overlapping complex interchanges in three-dimensional space making it much easier to see upcoming traffic conditions or to know which lane you need to be in and of course we'll be bringing this driving experience to car play later this year but it's not just driving we've also made big improvements for transit riders by helping them easily find nearby stations users can pin their favorite lines to the top and even keep track on their apple watch so there's no need to take your phone out of your pocket maps also automatically follows your transit route notifying you it's time to disembark as you approach your final destination and if you've ever exited a station unsure of which direction you need to go maps will help get you back on track simply hold up your iphone scan the buildings in the area and maps will generate a highly accurate position delivering detailed directions and augmented reality to help you complete your journey we're launching this beautiful new three-dimensional experience in these cities by the end of 2021 with many more to come next year and that's the all-new apple maps back to you craig so that's just some of what's new in apple maps an

airpods have helped us enjoy music like never before and they've helped us stay connected in so many different ways whether to friends and family to our devices or to our favorite entertainment with ios 15 we have some great new features coming to airpods starting with conversation boost which is designed to help people with mild hearing challenges stay more connected in conversations through computational audio and beamforming microphones conversation boost focuses your airpods pro on the person talking in front of you making it easier to hear and follow along in a face-to-face conversation and to help you hear the conversation even better you can also reduce the amount of ambient noise next when you can't reach for your iphone announced messages with siri helps you stay

you set a location for your reminder like the grocery store siri will read your shopping list to you right when you need it you can easily choose which apps to enable and select do not disturb when you don't want to be interrupted and if you're using the new focus feature your notification preferences are already taken into account next we have significantly improved how airpods work in find my with ios 15 you can locate your airpods pro and airpods max using the find my network your airpods simply send out a secure bluetooth beacon that can be detected by other apple devices they can relay your airpods location to the network and then back to your find my app and if they're nearby just choose play sound listen for the chirp whether they're in their case or out and the new proximity view in the find my app lets you know when you're getting close to make it even less likely to lose your air pods you can now receive a separation alert to notify you if you leave your airpods behind finally last year we introduced spatial audio with dynamic head tracking for airpods pro and then elevated the experience even further with the high fidelity audio of airpods max enabled by computational audio the three-dimensional theater-like sound really makes movies come to life this fall we're excited to extend spatial audio to tvos so now you can enjoy the full surround experience tuned for the big screen in your living room without disturbing the rest of the house and with dynamic head tracking it properly responds as you move about the room we're also bringing spatial audio with dynamic head tracking to mac os on our new m1 powered max so you can enjoy spatial audio on all of your devices in addition we recently announced spatial audio for apple music with the incredible multi-dimensional sound experience of dolby atmos and we're excited that it's available starting today with albums from some of your favorite artists like ariana grande the weeknd jay balvin and casey musgraves with the benefits of conversation boost the convenience of find my in the enhanced experience with spatial audio there are some great new features coming to the airpods family now back to you craig [Music] it's time to talk about ipad os ipad is an incredibly versatile device with its unique blend of mobility innovative technologies and touch first user experience and this experience is powered by ipad os with ipad os we build distinct capabilities that make it possible for ipad to become whatever you need it to be like when you're browsing your photos an ipad becomes an album of your most precious memories held right in your hands or when you pick up apple pencil and it becomes your notepad a markup tool or a canvas for new artwork or when you attach a keyboard and trackpad and it becomes a powerful way to work on your most important documents this unique set of capabilities mean that you can get things done right in the moment and can seamlessly move from capturing and working on your ideas to sharing them with ipad os 15 we're taking this versatility further making ipad even more capable and more intuitive and we started right on the home screen with widgets they offer beautiful glanceable information at just the right moments and this year we have a big update now you can place widgets among the apps on your home screen this is a huge deal let me show you how it works okay here i am on the home screen you can see that i already have a few widgets placed along the top let's start by adding a widget i'll bring up the widget gallery here you'll notice some new widgets like the beautiful new find my widget and the contacts widget which helps you reach family and friends with just a tap let's find a good spot for this towards the top here now i'll go back to the gallery and grab the parcel widget for tracking my incoming packages right on the home screen perfect now of course a bigger canvas means more room for widgets so we're adding a new larger format for widgets designed just for ipad's larger display here's the new apple tv widget i can easily dive into my favorite shows with a tab and here's my gaming page the new game center widget lets me jump into my games faster and discover what to play with friends and check out the new large size photo widget it really puts my favorite photos front and center and with this larger files widget i can keep tabs on all my work projects now with pages full of these great widgets some of my less frequently used apps have gotten pushed to later pages we wanted to make it easier to get to all of your apps so we've brought app library to ipad you can see all my apps are here automatically categorized for me and what's really cool is we built access to app library right into the dock so no matter where you are you can always get to your apps and now that you have app library you can hide pages that you no longer need just like this and even reorder them right from here that's widgets and app library we think this is going to change how you get information and access all your apps on ipad we also have a major update for another key part of the ipad os experience multitasking this year we've made it easier to discover easier to use and even more powerful to give you a closer look here's shabam thanks craig in ipad os 15 there's a new control that appears at the top of your apps tapping on it reveals the multitasking menu from here i can take an app full screen or work with two apps at the same time by creating a split view or slide over i'll tap on the split view icon and the app slides to the edge of the screen giving me quick access to my home screen where i can select from any of my apps i've been working on a podcast so i'll choose ferrite and now i can work with ferrite and notes at the same time in split view it's also really easy to switch apps in split view if i want to replace ferrite i can swipe down and notes moves aside letting me pick another app from the home screen let's select mail this works exactly the same way to choose a new app for either side of the screen and we brought the same ease of multitasking to apps with multiple windows in mail i can touch and hold on this message to open it centered on my screen this allows me to read the entire email without leaving my current view and i have the same multitasking controls here too so i can easily move this into split view or slide over but i want to save this email and come back to it later so i can just swipe down to minimize it into a new area we're calling the shelf the shelf gives me easy access to all open windows of an app let's go to safari and you'll see that the shelf appears automatically when i switch apps i often have a lot of safari windows open many in split view paired with other apps and now i can just tap to quickly switch between them i can also add or remove windows right here from the shelf we've made the app switcher even more powerful i can now create a split view just by dragging one app over another so that's multitasking in ipad os 15. now back to you craig thanks shabom these new multitasking features will help our users be more productive and do even more on their ipad and what's really cool is we now have a new set of keyboard shortcuts that let you do all of this without lifting a finger ipad os 15 also gives you more powerful ways to capture and organize your information with notes this year we're adding powerful new features for collaboration and organization first we're adding mentions just mention someone in a shared note and they'll get a notification linking them back there's also an all new activity view that quickly shows you what's changed in a shared note while you were away and to give users new ways to organize their notes we're adding tags you can add a tag anywhere in your note and then use the tag browser to quickly find your notes but sometimes you just want to quickly jot down a note to remember something important for later and that's why we're taking notes system-wide with a feature we call quick note quick note is a fast and easy way to get to a note no matter what you're doing here's will to show you how it works thanks craig starting a quick note is easy when i swipe the note appears out of the corner of the screen now that i've started a note i can type or i can write with apple pencil it's perfect for jotting down something like a phone number and when i'm done i just swipe it away let's open safari what's super cool about quick note is that it's aware of the app i'm using i'll start a new quick note on top of safari and now i can easily add a link from the website into my quick name i can tap this link anytime to return to this exact site let's go to a website i added a link to earlier a small thumbnail pops up in the corner that allows me to quickly get back to my quick note containing any useful information i found you'll notice there's text highlighted on the page i added this text to my quick note and tapping on a link from a highlight takes me right to the content on the page i can add a link from almost any app i'm using including third-party apps here's a link from yelp and if i tap it takes me right to the restaurant listing i can swipe across my quick note to see my most recent ones and anytime i want to see all my quick notes i can find them right where you'd expect in notes now back to craig thanks will so that's quick note a new way to capture information anywhere quick notes can be created on ipad os and mac os and you can access and edit them later on ios now let's talk about translate in just one year translate has already helped users make billions of translations on ios so we're excited to bring translate to ipad with experiences that leverage ipad's unique capabilities like practicing handwriting in another language with apple pencil or translating right next to your document with split view and translate was designed for conversations so we're making conversations feel easier and even more natural with auto translate auto translate detects when you're speaking and in which language so no one needs to tap a button to respond just speak and let translate do the rest we're also excited to announce system-wide translation so you can translate text anywhere just select the text and tap translate with live text you can even translate text in a photo system-wide translation is available on ipad os ios and mac os and of course you can download languages to use all of these features on device whether you're working on a document or meeting with someone translate makes ipad even more powerful now let's talk about swift playgrounds and how it's bringing a whole new dimension of productivity to ipad swift playgrounds is a great way to learn to code through a series of apple design lesson plans that are interactive and fun this year we're taking it even further by adding the ability to build apps on ipad you build these apps with swift ui which makes development easy the code you write is immediately reflected in the live preview of your app this new project type even works with xcode on mac swift playgrounds now supports improved code completion so you can just start typing and quickly add the suggestion to your code you also have access to the whole library of ui components and the documentation to go with it and if you're new to app development there's a guide to creating your first app while you're developing your app you can run it full screen to try it out and when you're ready you can even submit it to the app store this is amazing you can now build apps for iphone and ipad on ipad we think this will take ipad to new places that's ipad os 15 taking the versatility of ipad even further with new widget layouts for your home screen app library and a redesigned multitasking experience new note-taking and translation features and the ability to build apps with swift playgrounds combined with the great new features we talked about in ios it's time to completely rethink what you can do with your ipad next let's get into privacy at apple we believe privacy is a fundamental human right we don't think you should have to make a trade-off between great features and privacy we believe you deserve both since the beginning we've worked to help you keep your personal data under your control and over the years we've integrated powerful privacy controls into our operating systems most recently adding privacy nutrition labels and app tracking transparency today privacy is more important than ever because when you use the internet and third-party apps you can be tracked by a complex ecosystem of data brokers and ad tech firms often without your permission we don't think this is right we believe in protecting your privacy and giving you transparency and control over your information and to tell you about the new ways we're giving you even more control here are katie and eric [Music] thanks craig let's start with mail if you're like me you get a lot of marketing emails like this what you may not realize is that many of these emails use invisible pixels to collect information about your mail activity like when you open a message and even your ip address we think you should be able to choose whether to allow this or not so now in the mail app we're introducing mail privacy protection here's what it does it hides your ip address so senders can't link it to your other online activity or determine your location and it prevents senders from seeing if and when you've opened their email so now you can catch up on email with greater peace of mind safari leads the industry in protecting you against cross-site tracking with intelligent tracking prevention and this year we're making it even stronger by also hiding your ip address from trackers so they can't use it to link your activity across different sites or learn your location you can see which trackers are prevented from profiling you in the safari privacy report we wanted to bring this same transparency to apps used too so we're introducing the app privacy report this new section settings gives you an overview of how apps treat your privacy you can see how often apps use the permission you've granted to access your location photos camera microphone contacts and more during the last seven days and to find out who your data may be shared with you can see all the third-party domains the app is contacting so these are our new privacy system controls now let's talk about siri siri is available across all of your apple devices allowing you to quickly get things done with just your voice and siri is being used more than ever on over 600 million devices each month we recently added more diverse siri voice options and they sound incredible hi i'm siri if you need anything just ask now siri has a ton of great new features this year but today we want to focus on a major update to privacy series designed to process as much data on device as possible keeping your information private and with the power of the neural engine we're able to do this more than ever today we're introducing on-device speech recognition this means that by default your audio is all processed right on your iphone or ipad this addresses the biggest privacy concern we hear for voice assistance which is unwanted audio recording and this has some great benefits beyond privacy first you can now make many requests without an internet connection launch apps change settings control music and more second on-device processing speeds things up check this out i'll do a few requests back to back open photos [Music] open calendar turn on airplane mode [Music] set a timer for 20 minutes switch to dark mode wake me up at 7 a.m it's amazing how fast siri is with on-device processing so those are some of the powerful new privacy protections in mail safari and your apps along with on-device speech recognition for siri back to you craig [Music] next another part of our ecosystem that puts your privacy first is icloud here to tell you about some great new updates is mike [Music] many of us rely on icloud to safely store a lot of personal information and it's important to always have access so let's start off with two improvements we're making to your apple id first we're adding a new way to get back into your account if you ever forget your password or get locked out you'll now have the option to have people you trust like family and friends to a recovery contact list they won't get any access to your account but if you ever forget your password you can call them to get the code you need to get right back in it's fast easy and secure second we're launching a new digital legacy program we don't often think about it but it's important that we can easily pass down information to family members or friends when we pass away you'll now be able to add people to your account as legacy contacts so when you're gone they can simply request access and your information can be passed along quickly and easily icloud has always kept your important information like photos documents and notes safe up-to-date and accessible across all of your devices and today we're making some big updates we're upgrading our paid subscription to something that we call icloud plus icloud plus combines everything you love about icloud with some great new features starting with something to help protect your privacy online on any given day we all use a variety of networks to browse the web from the internet in our own homes to public wi-fi on the go and behind the scenes network providers and websites can combine your identity and browsing history into a detailed profile about you so now in addition to everything safari does to protect you online we are introducing a new service called private relay it lets you browse with safari in an even more secure and private way and the way it works is really cool it ensures that the traffic leaving your device is encrypted so no one can intercept and read it then all of your requests are sent through two separate internet relays it's designed so that no one including apple can see both who you are and what sites you're visiting and it does all this without compromising performance next let's talk about another icloud plus feature hide my email we've all had moments we've thought twice about sharing our personal email address like when we're filling out a form on the web with hide my email you can share a unique random address that forwards messages to your personal inbox and it's built right into mail safari and icloud settings so it's easy to set up as many addresses as you need and delete them at any time keeping you in control icloud plus also includes built-in support for homekit secure video more and more of us are using security cameras to keep an eye on our homes with icloud plus you can connect more cameras than ever and none of the video counts against your icloud storage it's just a part of your subscription of course you'll still get everything else you love about icloud including photos backup and icloud drive and the best part is we're not changing our prices at all you'll get all of icloud plus our new private relay service hide my email and expanded home kit secure video support for the same low prices we offer today we're really excited to be giving users an even more private and connected experience with icloud plus now over to symbol for the latest developments in health your health and the well-being of your family is always important to you and never more so than this past year apple's commitment to health is stronger than ever we're collaborating with medical experts to accelerate health innovation and we're empowering individuals to improve their health as well as make it easier for them to participate in large-scale research studies with our apis developers are using our devices and health app to come up with ingenious ways to push things forward here's an example i'm francoise marvel i'm a cardiology fellow at johns hopkins seth martin i'm also a cardiologist at johns hopkins seth and i spend our days alongside our patients at the bedside you know six white coats hovering over a bed and we're trying to actually share what the patient's condition is how they need to improve their life we use medical jargon we speak quickly we confuse patients and they're left on their own there has to be a better way than just treating a patient handing them a bunch of papers and expecting that they're going to understand how to change their life we thought well what if we completely re-engineer the process for a heart attack patient by using research kit care kit health kit and then connecting it with an apple watch so we can bring in key cardiovascular metrics that help us to know patients are doing well when francoise was in the technology accelerator program at hopkins the work there led to this phone call with apple and towards the end of the phone call francoise said to divya at apple what can we do to accelerate this and divya said you guys gotta come out to cupertino let's turn your vision into reality and we had a silicon valley airbnb and we started side by side coding with our ios developers and then every couple hours we would talk about their vision and tools they could leverage we go to a whiteboard and we lay out here the things you guys should go tackle when we go back to our airbnb pour more coffee you know order some bubble teas eat some food and then we would go into cupertino they'd come back into cupertino piled in a minivan and spend like almost a full day there getting more feedback working with their teams and then they would leave our offices and work through the night building and implementing the things we had talked about with our tools and their vision we ultimately made magic together we left cupertino invigorated and guess what our clinical trial was able to save an incredible amount of people from having complications and come back to the hospital and it reduced hospital readmissions by 52 and likely saved a lot of lives i remember we were just sitting outside beautiful cupertino weather i know just one of those moments where don dennis victoria app was going to have an impact on so many people's hearts around the world this is the start of something incredible it's the spark and now let's light the fire this is just one of the many inspiring stories out there and is a testament to the innovative work happening in the medical community a critical part of taking care of yourself is monitoring changes in your health which can be subtle and easy to miss over time so this year we're offering three new features to help you to identify measure and understand those changes and here's adithy to tell you about the first of these features let's start with mobility the way that you move and walk can indicate balance issues and gait impairment this is the leading cause of falls in adults currently fall risk is assessed by a care provider through a questionnaire and an in-person evaluation that this can miss out on your everyday movement so important changes can go unnoticed your iphone already captures mobility data as you walk with scientifically validated metrics we're building on this to introduce a completely new way to assess your risk of falling called walking steadiness for the first time ever you can get inside if your fall risk increases and take action early to improve your steadiness let's take a quick look at some of the science behind this as you walk with your iphone the built-in motion sensors automatically measure how fast and how evenly you walk the length of your steps and the timing of each step right down to how often you have both feet on the ground combined these metrics provide powerful insight on changes in your balance stability and coordination we used real world data from the apple heart and movement study with over 100 000 participants across all ages this is the largest data set ever used to study fall risk and it's helped create this first of its kind health metric you can view your walking steadiness in the health app you'll see a classification of okay if the metrics show that you're stable while walking you can see how your walking steadiness may change as the months go by and receive a notification if your steadiness is low or very low and you're at increased risk of falling you can also learn how to improve your steadiness there are movement exercises right in the health app and these can help you increase your strength and balance and reduce your risk of falling now back to symbol to tell you about another way to monitor health changes you can already view lab results like your cholesterol right in the health app in the u.s alone 14 billion clinical laboratory tests are performed each year that is a lot of information to keep track of when you see your own results come in it can be hard to understand what these tests mean or what has changed the health app will now include detailed descriptions to help you better understand your lab data for example when you receive a cholesterol result you can now see that the ldl is a bad cholesterol and having too much may put you at risk for heart disease you can also now see whether your labs are within expected ranges together these views will help you get even more meaning from your lab results many health changes happen over time so to better understand your health even more holistically we're introducing trends you'll get insight on long-term changes across areas such as steps resting heart rate blood glucose sleep and much more you'll also be alerted when there's a new trend in your data which may be something you want to monitor more closely or even discuss with your physician so if you're getting more daily walks in your health summary will show that your steps taken have increased over the last few months this is a great way to celebrate progress towards meeting your health goals and a powerful new way to get early insight into potential health issues with trends walking steadiness and a better labs experience you have three new ways to see changes in your overall health another really important part of managing your health is having meaningful conversations with your doctor during your visit physicians look at your vitals and labs but we'll also ask you about everyday health activities like exercise and sleep and patients can often have difficulty remembering all of these details but the health app has all of this valuable information so to support this conversation you can now share health data that you choose with your health care provider in a private way for example if you have a concern about your heart health you can now share your heart data this is shared securely no one else including apple will see this information your doctor can then view this data directly from their electronic health record system and look for important trends such as changes in activity and a history of alerts like high heart rate access to this information helps give your doctor a more complete view of your everyday health outside of the clinic we're so excited about this new capability to share your data from the health app directly with your doctor these electronic health record companies in the u.s will be the first to support this feature and we look forward to expanding availability even more in the coming months now for many of us it's not just the changes in our own health we care about it's the health of our family and loved ones too whether they live with us or far away for some of us that means taking care of our kids and for others it's our aging parents and for many of us it's actually taking care of both generations above and below to empower you to care for others we're introducing health sharing a private and secure way to view health data trends and alerts for the people most important to you for example i could set up a sharing relationship with my mom and with her permission i could view data like her heart rate activity and labs and just like with my own health data trends proactively highlights changes in my mom's health data for me i can also receive notifications including high heart rate alerts changes in mobility and more and it's easy for me to connect with her about her health so if i see a noteworthy change like her resting heart rate increasing i can simply tap messages and start a conversation with my mom this is a powerful new way to stay connected to the well-being of those you love you'll have peace of mind and they'll know they have a trusted partner on their health journey since the beginning of our work in health all of our health features have been architected to keep your data secure and protect your privacy your health data is under your control and is encrypted in transit and at rest the permissions built into the sharing experience give you granular control over which types of data you share and with whom and you can make changes at any time right from the sharing tab data you share is sent in an encrypted form and apple does not have access to any of this information privacy is fundamental in the design and development across all of our health features we're so excited for what's coming in health a first of its kind metric to assess fall risk richer insights to understand changes in your health and completely new abilities for you to privately share selected data with your doctors and loved ones now i'll hand it over to kevin to talk about watch os [Music] apple watch is already the most loved watch in the world it keeps you healthy active and connected with features like fall detection ecg and cycle tracking apple watch is an essential health companion it motivates you to close your activity rings and transforms the way you stay fit and staying connected to the people and things you care about most is easy with apple watch all from your wrist in watchus 8 we're introducing more capabilities in each of these areas let's start with health more than ever people are realizing the importance of dedicating time to practice mindfulness in fact the breathe app has grown in popularity particularly over this last year in watchos 8 the breathe app has been enhanced to give you more opportunities to slow down and be mindful including a new animation that has a beautiful look and feel to help you center and calm as you breathe we're also introducing reflect a new way for you to be more mindful for example a reflection could be think about something you love to do and why it brings you joy a gentle animation helps you focus and studies show that regular mindful moments like this can lead to increased positive emotions and overall psychological well-being the reflected brief sessions live in the new mindfulness app this will help you reduce stress and relax your body and mind with the sleep app we introduce an entirely new way for you to meet your sleep goals and track metrics like time of sleep heart rate and even blood oxygen in watchos 8 apple watch can track another key metric while sleeping respiratory rate this is a vital sign that measures how many breaths you take per minute and since your sleeping respiratory rate tends to be consistent over time a change may indicate a shift in your overall wellness you'll be notified of a meaningful trend and your respiratory rate has been identified and you can see even more details and respiratory rate in the health app now i'd like to turn it over to jules to tell you what's coming to help you stay active apple watch is the perfect companion to motivate you to be more fit and watch os 8 adds two of the most popular workout types that are great for bringing more mindful movement to your routine first a new tai chi workout this chinese martial art is thousands of years old and is often described as meditation in motion

some of the great experiences we're bringing to the home this fall with incredible new features like home keys share play for shared viewing and access to siri in more places than ever before your smart home has never been more capable back to craig let's talk about mac os mac os has always been about the fusion of power and simplicity and with our current release mac os big sur we introduced a bold new design that gives users more control and huge updates for apps all while making everything even easier to use and when combined with the m1 chip big sur delivers unmatched levels of performance and battery life with people using the mac more than ever mac os has become an even bigger part of our daily lives and our next release is focused on helping you do even more but what should we call it well that brings us to the latest exploits of our crack marketing team with their annual vision quest postponed our merry band of nomadic neighbors wandered aimlessly through the california hills before donning their technicolored wetsuits and immersing themselves in the inspiration of the beautiful rich waters of monterey mac os monterey gives you the power to accomplish more than ever and helps you work fluidly across all of your devices the incredible features we talked about earlier are going to be great for the ways you work on mac like the new capabilities in facetime which help you look and sound your best while talking to co-workers or friends with shareplay it's just plain awesome to watch movies and shows together on your stunning mac display or share an app window as you collaborate on a project shared with you offers a totally new way to discover photos articles and more that people share with you over messages right in your mac apps and when you're working hard on mac you can choose a focus that syncs across all your devices helping reduce distracting notifications so you can get the job done plus quick note and notes give you versatile new ways to capture and organize your thoughts these powerful features are just fantastic on mac and we have even more new features that make it easier to work across all your devices starting with continuity every device we make is powerful in its own way and when you use them together you unlock new experiences that feel truly magical this year we've created a completely new way to work across your devices with greater precision and speed and we call it universal control with universal control you can now use a single mouse and keyboard to move between your mac and ipad for a seamless experience universal control is so incredible you just have to see it in action let me show it to you now i'm putting the finishing touches on an illustration here on my ipad it's the last piece i need to finish a presentation that i have open on my macbook now i'll just set my ipad down next to my mac and check this out without any other setup i'm going to simply move my mac cursor towards my ipad and the ipad automatically recognizes it and if i move a bit further boom my cursor is now on the ipad how cool is that and now i can move my cursor back and forth effortlessly between the two now it's easy to control my ipad with just the keyboard and trackpad on my mac for instance i can click and close this document and flick on my trackpad to return to my ipad home screen of course i can swipe between my pages of apps and i can use my macbook's keyboard to open spotlight and say launch nodes and even use command tab to switch back to procreate this is really powerful with universal control i can even drag and drop files between my devices i'm just going to take this drawing i finished on my ipad and drop it on the keynote on my mac awesome for our pros out there universal control works with more than two devices so let's add this imac into the mix now i can use the trackpad on my macbook to control my imac as well i can also switch to use my imacs keyboard and mouse and this is so cool watch this now i have a title text image i've been working on here in procreate on my ipad now i'm going to take this image and drag it across all three devices and drop it in to final cut just like that let's see the final product nice that's a quick look at universal control on mac os monterey universal control makes it effortless to move between your devices so you can be more productive and focus your energy on the task at hand another way our devices work great together is with airplay we all love the way airplane lets us watch a movie or share a presentation from your iphone to a tv just like that but there's another screen with its stunning retina display that makes everything you watch simply amazing that's why we're introducing airplay to mac it works just like airplay today so it's instantly familiar you can play present and share just about anything as you draw a sketch on ipad your colleagues can follow along on the bigger display and you can even take advantage of any mac's high fidelity sound by using it as an airplay speaker airplay brings your mac to life in whole new ways with mac os monterey your devices work together like never before making it more fluid to work across them and we're not just reinventing how you work between devices we're also giving you powerful new tools to get more work done on your devices the mac has a long deep history of automation with command line shell scripts applescript and automator and on ios we've made automation even easier with shortcuts shortcuts take all the taps and swipes you usually need to order your favorite lunch and makes it as simple as tapping a button or asking siri shortcuts is all about helping you get more done faster because you can let your device do the work for you and this year we're bringing shortcuts to the mac the mac is after all where we turn for so much of our creative work and now you can automate the everyday stuff to achieve peak productivity you get access to a rich gallery of pre-built shortcuts designed just for mac you can set up a shortcut to instantly share selected files with your friends so they never miss a moment and with the shortcuts editor you can easily link together a series of actions to design shortcuts for your specific workflows for instance if you're a designer get right to work with a shortcut that opens pinterest in one window affinity photo in another and start your favorite playlist in apple music all in one click we've weaved shortcuts throughout mac os so you can run them no matter what app is open they're in finder menu bar spotlight and of course you can ask siri to run them hands-free shortcuts is the future of automation on mac and this is just the start of a multi-year transition automator will continue to be supported and you can import automator workflows into shortcuts beginning day one with shortcuts there are more ways than ever to create express yourself and get stuff done finally we have some really big news about an app that's central to the mac experience safari we built safari from the very beginning to provide the best browsing experience on mac and it continues to blow the competition out of the water safari is the world's fastest browser it makes navigating even the most complex websites lightning fast and safari is known for its legendary power efficiency on an m1 macbook pro safari users can get up to 17 hours of browsing and of course safari sets the bar for user privacy on the web with features like privacy report and intelligent tracking prevention our users are doing more in the browser than ever before work school shopping entertainment and that often leaves them with a lot of tabs windows and other distractions we think using the browser should feel natural and uncluttered so we've reimagined the browsing experience we distilled the toolbar to its essential elements tabs are more compact modern and lightweight and there's a completely new way to use tabs with tab groups they allow you to easily save and manage your tabs without cluttering up your tab bar i'll hand it to beth to show it in action [Music] thanks craig let's start with safari's gorgeous new tab design all of my tabs are right here in the new streamline tab bar one of the really cool things that we did this year is we built the search field right into the active tab safari is more space efficient than ever and i can see more of the page i can click on the active tab to see the page's full address and then i can search right from here reader is in the tab bar whenever i need it and everything else is right here in the more menu check this out as i switch tabs the tab bar takes on the color of the site that i'm viewing so it feels like a part of the page it looks beautiful next i'm so excited to tell you about tab groups tab groups are an easy and lightweight way to save your tabs and pick them back up later i'll open the new redesigned sidebar and i have a few tab groups here already each of these groups is a whole set of tabs i use them for meal planning for news and for gift shopping here in my open tabs i'm planning a road trip to los angeles and i'm not done with my research yet i can save these into a tab group and come back to it later i'll click the new tab group button and call this trip to la what's so powerful about tab groups is that they're on all my devices i've got my macbook here and look my new tab group is here already as i make changes to my tab groups they update everywhere i'm going to open a bunch of tabs and my imac just keeps up and if i change my current tab my tab group is always up to date and i never miss a thing i can't wait to share these trip ideas with my family i can just drag this tab group into an email and send it off once you start using tab groups we know you're going to want to get to them all the time so we made it super easy to switch from right here in the tab bar that's the new safari on mac we didn't stop there though back to craig to tell you more thanks beth when we were designing the new tab experience we wanted to build something that worked consistently when you switch from your mac to your iphone or ipad on ipad the new tabs and tab bar work just like they do on mac tab groups are especially helpful on ipad and the instant syncing means you can continue a project from anywhere on iphone we've done something really special we took all the thinking that went into mac and ipad and pushed the envelope even further for this smaller screen size we're introducing something that's easier to reach and maximizes the page on screen the new tab bar appears with just a tab and it's directly under your thumb and when you scroll the bar moves seamlessly out of the way it's now easier and more natural to access your other tabs too you can just swipe over the tab bar to move quickly between them or swipe up the tab bar to reveal a brand new grid view of all your tabs plus your tab groups when you get to the end of your tabs you can swipe again to open a new one and the new customizable start page syncs with mac so you have the same safari experience everywhere there's one last feature that we're really excited to share extensions mac users love to deeply customize safari with extensions like grammarly honey and momentum and now we're bringing web extensions to iphone and ipad just like on mac you choose what website you want extensions to be active on and developers can easily tap into an entirely new audience because these extensions can share code with existing safari web extensions this is a huge year for safari a totally new tab design and tab groups simplify your browsing and safari is more customizable than ever with a new start page and extensions on ios and ipad os and with that we have mac os monterey it's a fantastic release with great new features that help mac users do more than ever you can work across mac and your other devices using universal control and airplay to mac it's easy to get productive and creative using shortcuts and the totally new design for safari along with incredible features like share play shared with you focus and quick note we do have more we'd like to talk about but first let's get out of here [Music] probably should have just taken the car as i mentioned a moment ago we've made incredible advances in mac os and across all of our platforms this year these are going to be awesome for users they also create new opportunities for our developers the heart and soul of wwdc and to tell you about the new developer features and technologies we've been building to help you take your apps to the next level here's our vp of wwdr susan prescott it's such a privilege to come together with our developer community and to connect with your creative energy over the course of the week apple engineers are going to share all kinds of exciting new technologies and features that we think you're going to love and there are a few announcements that we just couldn't wait to share apis that will help you create even more incredible apps swift features that make the language both easier and more powerful and app store features that will help you better connect with users let's start with apis and there are a lot of new apis this year like the ones for shareplay that make it possible to build new shared experiences for iphone ipad mac and apple tv and system level enhancements like voice isolation wide spectrum audio and portrait mode that can work in any video conferencing app new apis for focus and notifications a new extra large widget size for ipad the screen time api always on apps for watch os new advanced rendering apis in reality kit and we've gone even further in this release to make it easy for all developers to create realistic 3d objects with object capture object capture is a revolutionary new api on macos rather than manually creating 3d models which can take weeks object capture uses photogrammetry to turn a series of 2d images into realistic 3d objects in just minutes leading developers like maxon and unity are already using object capture to unlock entirely new ways of creating 3d content it's as simple as taking photos of an object on your iphone or ipad then importing them into cinema 4d to create a lifelike 3d model for the first time developers can generate an ar preview of the model to ensure they've captured what they need while on location and wayfair is using object capture to develop tools for their manufacturers so they can use an iphone and mac to easily create a virtual representation of their merchandise this will allow wayfair users to preview more products in their homes with ar to make sure they choose the right product for their space this is a massive step forward for 3d content creation what used to be the most difficult and expensive part of building ar experiences in 3d scenes is now available to all developers in mac os monterey object capture and all of the apis we've talked about today are built on this swift programming language swift has made a huge impact on our app ecosystem and today the majority of the top thousand apps are built using swift to tell you about the improvements you are making this year here's ted thanks susan we designed swift to make it easy to create great apps it has an approachable modern syntax incredible runtime performance and safety features that eliminate whole categories of programming errors in recent years we've worked with the swift open source community to build tons of new features that make swift easier and more powerful and this year one of the biggest features we're building into swift is concurrency concurrency is one of the most requested features for swift and it's key to building apps that are responsive to user input while doing work in the background concurrency also makes it dramatically easier to write code that does work in parallel so your app can take full advantage of multi-core processors without language features that simplify concurrency you need to write a synchronous code that's hard to write hard to understand and hard to debug our approach to concurrency swift builds on the same core principles of swift itself making it easier to write fast modern safe code with fewer mistakes we build structured concurrency deep into the swift language and use the common async await pattern combined with a technology called actors this means you can write code as a simple sequence of steps with actors safely isolating parallel tasks from one another so building code for concurrency goes from something complicated like this to something simple like this that kind of power and simplicity is what swift is all about and we're excited to share more with you this week now back to susan we created swift and all of these other technologies and frameworks for one reason to help you build the best possible apps and the best place to discover those apps is on the app store to tell you about some of the exciting features we've been working on here's ann since the beginning we designed the app store to be a safe and trusted place users can just focus on finding the right app knowing apple has reviewed every app to make sure it meets our high standards for security privacy and safety and that's why the app store now serves nearly 600 million weekly visitors in 175 countries and regions making it a great business opportunity for all developers and an engine for innovation and growth and apple has now paid over 230 billion dollars to developers since the app store launched today we're introducing some incredible new ways to help developers like you reach even more users starting with the app product page this year you'll be able to create multiple custom product pages to showcase different features of your app for different users you can also try out different screenshots videos and even app icons to understand what users like most these improvements will give you even more ways to tell the world about your app it's also important to showcase the dynamic things happening inside your apps the most popular apps and games are constantly introducing new content and limited time events like pokemon go fest film premieres like in the heights and nike fitness challenges events across the entire app ecosystem help users find the next big thing this year we're introducing new ways to discover amazing events like these we call them in-app events with in-app events the dynamic content and experiences within apps will be front and center on the app store so users never miss a big moment and this is huge for developers in-app events can be surfaced throughout the store to millions of users whether they're brand new to the app or they use it every day you can showcase them on your app's product page users can learn more sign up to be notified or quickly join the action if it's happening now they can discover events with personalized recommendations and in search our expert editors will curate the best and biggest events and the new app store widget will feature upcoming events right on the home screen with in-app events the app store continues to be the best place to discover what's happening in apps and games and this will be open to all developers whether they already have events or they're just getting started and now i'll hand it back to susan there's something else we're doing this year and it's going to take app development to the next level it integrates the cloud with our developer tools in a powerful new way and it's called xcode cloud today creating an app requires multiple steps building testing and delivery and a number of different tools xcode cloud simplifies the workflow by bringing everything together so as an individual developer you can focus your energy on being creative and development teams can collaborate more effectively here's how it works when you commit a change to your code xcode cloud can automatically build the app because it's built in the cloud your mac is free for other tasks and for teams everyone can see if the change introduces errors so everyone can find and fix issues faster then xcode cloud runs your automated tests in parallel so they complete in a fraction of the time even as they simulate running on every kind of apple device and platform and the test results are displayed in xcode so you can easily see what worked and fix what didn't finally once the app passes all its tests xcode cloud can automatically distribute it to the testers on your team and even external beta testers with test flight and all of these essential continuous integration and delivery features are right there in xcode so you can work without switching tools and you can stay focused on your code xcode cloud is the quickest easiest way to build test and deliver your apps and it's built with advanced security to protect you and your projects your source code is only used in a temporary build environment and the only things xcode cloud stores are the products of the build xcode cloud and test flight make it easy to distribute betas to users on iphone ipad apple watch and apple tv and we want xcode cloud to be able to automatically distribute beta apps across all apple platforms to make that happen we're bringing test flight to the mac so you can use test flight to easily test your mac apps including features like in-app purchases xcode cloud is incredibly powerful and we can't wait for you to use it and see how it will help you to build better apps faster we'll be providing access to a limited beta starting today and expanding access to this free beta throughout this summer and fall and xcode cloud will be available to all developers next year we'll provide more details on pricing and availability this fall we're really excited about these announcements and these are just some of the highlights we continue to innovate with the app store and tools and technologies to help you do extraordinary things and we're going to be telling you even more in sessions throughout the week now back to tim but first much better take it home tim thank you susan and thank you craig and thanks to all of our presenters what a big day of announcements and innovations for our users and our developers we took giant steps forward with all of our software platforms and they will enable our users and developers to do remarkable things our os releases will be available as developer betas today and each of them will have a public beta next month and all of this incredible software will be available to all of our users this fall i am so excited for these new releases and how they will make our products even more powerful and more capable they will provide users new ways to enrich their lives and developers new tools to change the world we hope you've enjoyed today's event and that you're excited for the week ahead for those developers who want to take a deeper dive into our announcements we have the platform state of the union coming up later today and we have a week full of in-depth sessions and one-to-one labs with apple engineers we will also provide pavilions daily recaps and other experiences to help you get the most out of the conference thank you for joining us let's have a great week [Music] [Music] chances [Music] you hello

and get ready for his sports. I was on my way home
with my son Parker. At the time he was
nine months old. There was one morning I had
these incredible heart pains, and I was short of breath, and we were walking
up this hill. My watch just kept dinging
at me, and it was like, "You have
an elevated heart rate. What's going on?" I'm like, "I'm just walking,"
you know? That heart rate alert just kept
going off, off, and off, and I was like, "OK. This isn't normal,"
you know? [LAUGHS] I was probably
about a mile offshore. This kite is, you know,
bobbing underwater, and the lines are underwater, and it's all wrapped
around the fin. So I sort of swallowed my pride
and began to gather my gear to do what's called
a self-rescue. ♪ Jim had come downstairs
and told me that, you know, "Hey, Dad. This is really
weird, but look at my watch. It's showing my heart rate
is 150 beats per minute." So we called his doctor. She said, "You need to just
take him to the hospital." We were stopped at a red light. Out of nowhere,
completely blindsided, Parker and I got hit
by a drunk driver going 62 miles an hour. I go get the scan,
and sure enough, they find a bunch of clots
in my left lung. And they rush me out
of there immediately. They're like,
"Stay put. Don't move." Like... [LAUGHS] "These things can dislodge
at any second." I kept swimming,
and I kept swimming, and it didn't seem like
I got any closer. And I looked at my watch
and thought, "Wow, I'm going
to try this out." I hadn't even tried
a call from the water. Called my son. He was able to text me
the number for the rescue boat. It was weird, they just started
filling the room. So I go from having two nurses
and a cardiologist and the attending emergency room
doctor in there to suddenly more and more people
are getting in there. By this point, his heart rate
was just going 175, 180 beats per minute, and it's just steadily
staying there. The only thing that I could
comprehend was sound. And in that moment, I grabbed
down and I felt my wrist, and I felt my watch. And I immediately said,
"Siri, call 911." The ambulance was able
to ping where I was at, and the police officer was able
to hand us over to the medical team. [EXHALES] Yeah, so when I found out
that I had the clots, my entire life flashed
in front of my eyes. The main doctor
at the ER was like, "If you waited a couple days, you probably would
not have made it." They were getting ready
to push another medication, and then the cardiologist
comes in there. He looked at me,
he says, "I just want you to be prepared, if this does not work,
you're going to be airlifted." And it just kind of hit me
how serious this was. Everybody in that room
was just quiet, I mean, just watching that
monitor, all staring at it. And then all of a sudden,
it... [CRYING] ...it came down. And he was --
he was OK. The Apple Watch enabled me
to take control of my situation, whereas previously,
I wasn't able to do that. It saved my life,
it saved Parker's life. That was hard,
the idea that I almost lost him makes me appreciate him
a little bit more. ♪ the apple iphone 13 has now been finalized with some incredible hardware and i'll be sharing the details right after this [Music] so the iphone 13 series have now been finalized in production of many parts has begun thanks to this we now have plenty of information to share on the design and the specifications and for once it's all good news before we get started though please like the video if you're an apple fan let me know in the comments what device you're actually watching today's video on and make sure to hit subscribe now and don't miss any future info so the first story of the day is about the launch date of the iphone 13 series across the globe we've had many people struggling with product supply thanks to the chip shortages but it would appear that as previously advised apple are not going to be affected by this and that the iphone 13 is going to launch on time according to digi times tsmc who manufacture the chips from apple have already started production on the a15 bionic not only that but they're producing it in greater numbers than the a14 so we shouldn't have a short supply of iphone 13 phones now not only does this confirm that the iphone 13 is going to be launching on time in september but as i said many times before we're not going to see an m1 in the iphone 13 and it is going to use the a15 bionic we also have another report from digitime stating that all versions of the iphone 13 are going to be equipped with voice coil motors and it's not going to be limited to just the pro max now voice coil motors or vcms are behind what apple calls sensor shift stabilization and it makes for a much better camera it makes the sensor actually move on its axis and apple say that it stabilizes over 5000 times a second compared to the 1000 times a second that we get on their normal optical stabilization we also had early rumors of a lidar scanner on all iphone 13 models but we haven't heard much on it since i'm going to try and find out for you guys that but given that production for many parts has now started we should have an answer for you soon now next up we've got great news on the iphone 13 displays and this comes courtesy of the elec who have been a huge source of the iphone 13 reports according to the elect samsung displays have already begun producing the oled panels to be used in the iphone 13s and they are 120 hertz ltpo displays now these displays are for the iphone 13 pro and the iphone 13 pro max and they're reportedly going to be called pro motion displays as they have been called in the past now according to the report lg have also began producing the iphone 13 displays for the lower end models so it looks like boe weren't able to pass the quality checks again so it's great news that not only is the iphone 13 coming on time but it's coming with all of the specs that were rumored so early on now there was plenty of disappointment with 60hz displays last year and i for one am very pleased to see these updated displays now for those of you out there that are excited for the iphone 13 we're now going to run through the specs design launch date and pricing for all four models for my regular viewers you guys have already seen this so just jump to the next video but if you're new here then make sure you hit subscribe and we'll get right into it so to start us off with that we've got the entry level model the iphone 13 mini although there were low sales on the predecessor reports suggest that we're still going to see a 13 mini but it may be the last time now the iphone 13 mini is a 5.4 inch phone with an oled super retina display it's expected to have a resolution of 2340x1080 and this will give us 465 pixels per inch we only get a 60hz display on the mini but we still get a thinner notch with the cool speaker move to the top with apple continuing to prove that huge amounts of ram are just not required it should be equipped with four gigs of ram and a choice of 64 128 or 256 storage we're expecting another aluminium frame to reduce cost but the body will look similar to that of the pros of course we get the selfie camera on the front and the iphone 13 mini comes with a dual camera setup on the rear this can be a 12 megapixel wide angle and a 12 megapixel ultrawide and the layout has changed slightly with the lenses now diagonal to each other and it will of course ship with ios 15. now for those of you that want the 4 gig ram with 64 gig storage it's likely launching at a price of 700 for 128 gig it's gonna be around 750 and for 256 it will be around 850 dollars now next up we've got the iphone 13. the iphone 13 is going to have a 6.1 inch oled display with a resolution of around 25 32 by 1170 giving us 460 pixels per inch again we only get a 60 hertz display and no ltpo technology but we do get a reduced notch up top we expect four gigs of ram along with a choice of 64 128 or 256 gig storage and the iphone 13 is gonna have an aluminium frame we're expecting a 12 megapixel wide angle and a 12 megapixel ultrawide giving us a dual camera setup and the iphone will of course ship with ios 15. for the 64 gig model it's expected to be 800 for the 128 it's 850 and for the 256 it's 949 next up we've got the iphone 13 pro coming with some big improvements over the predecessor the iphone 13 pro is expected to come with a 6.1 inch oled display with a resolution of 2532x1170 and this gives us 460 pixels per inch it's not only going to be brighter but it's also going to be using ltpo technology and provide us with a 120hz variable refresh rate and it's still going to be capable of 120hz at its full resolution the a15 is more than capable with ios so we expect them to stay with six gigs of ram and it's going to come with a choice of 128 256 512 and maybe even one terabytes of storage because this is the more premium model we're expecting a still frame on the iphone 13 pro and of course we're getting a quad camera setup this is going to be a 12 megapixel wide angle a 12 megapixel ultra wide a 12 megapixel telephoto and of course the additional lidar scanner the phone will of course ship with ios 15 when it comes to pricing we expect some small price increases with the new display technology so we're estimating it for 128 gig it's gonna be 1050 for 256 gig it's gonna be 1150 for 512 it's gonna be 1350 and if there is a one terabyte version it's likely to be around fifteen hundred dollars now finally we've got the iphone 13 pro max the iphone 13 pro max is coming with a 6.7 inch oled display with a resolution of 2278 by 1128 giving us 458 pixels per inch again it's going to be a brighter display using ltpo technology and provide us with 120hz variable refresh rate at its full resolution we can expect six gigs of ram a choice of 128 256 and 512 storage and if the leaks are true then we could see one terabyte because this is the most premium model we expect another still frame on the iphone 13 pro max and we're also getting a quad camera setup again it's gonna be a 12 megapixel wide angle 12 megapixel ultra wide and a 12 megapixel telephoto along with the additional lidar sensor the phone will of course ship with ios 15 when it comes to pricing we expect some small price increases with the new technology so for 128 gig it's likely to be around thousand one hundred and fifty dollars for 256 it's going to be 1250 for 512 it could be around 1450 and if one terabyte happens we could see something huge like 1 600 so that's it for the whole iphone 13 series the launch is expected to be in september and although there have been many delays across the industry this year reports suggest that the iphone 13 is not affected while no date has been confirmed yet it's likely to be the 40th of september so it's not too much longer to wait of course as always i'd like to know your thoughts in the comments who out there is excited for the apple iphone 13 and what model are you waiting for but thanks for watching the video if you liked it smash the thumbs up if you didn't hit the thumbs down twice and i'll see you guys in the next one [Music] you ♪ >>> THIS IS A GROSS ABUSE OF POWER. IT’S AN ASSAULT ON THE SEPARATION OF POWERS. THE NOTION THAT ANY PRESIDENT VIA POLITICAL APPOINTEES COULD MANIPULATE OUR DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM TO TAP INTO PERSONAL DATA HAS THE FINGERPRINTS OF A DICTATORSHIP, A DICTATORSHIP, ALL OVER IT. >> HI AGAIN, EVERYONE, IT’S 5:00 IN THE EAST. WHATEVER WE LEARN NEXT ABOUT THE EXTRAORDINARY OCCASION OF A SITTING WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL WHO EMERGED AS THE SINGLE MOST DAMAGING WITNESS TO DONALD J. TRUMP IN THE SPECIAL COUNSEL INVESTIGATION INTO THE EX-PRESIDENT’S EFFORTS TO OBSTRUCT A PROBE INTO HIS TIES WITH RUSSIA, DON’T LOSE SIGHT OF THIS. THE DOJ SPYING ON ITS OWN CONDUIT TO THE PRESIDENT IS SOMETHING SERIOUSLY SCREWED UP. "NEW YORK TIMES" CITING TWO PEOPLE FAMILIAR WITH THE MATTER REPORTING THE BOMBSHELL REVELATION THAT WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL DON McGAHN AND HIS WIFE WERE SPIED ON DURING THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY BY THE DOJ AND, THIS IS IMPORTANT, THAT A GAG ORDER TO KEEP IT UNDER WRAPS WAS EXTENDED THROUGH AT LEAST TWO TRUMP ATTORNEYS GENERAL. FROM THAT "TIMES" REPORTING, QUOTE, IT IS NOT CLEAR WHAT FBI AGENTS WERE INVESTIGATING, WHETHER MR. McGAHN WAS THEIR SPECIFIC FOCUS OR WHETHER HE WAS SWEPT UP IN A LARGER NET BECAUSE HE HAD COMMUNICATED WITH SOMEONE WHO WAS UNDER SCRUTINY. STILL, THE DISCLOSURE THAT AGENTSAD COLLECTED DATA ON A SITTING WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL IS EXTRAORDINARY. NBC NEWS HAS REACHED OUT TO APPLE AND DON McGAHN, WE HAVE YET TO RECEIVE A RESPONSE BUT HERE’S WHERE THIS NEWS MAY GO FROM SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY TO A FIVE ALARM FILE. THE EXTREME MEASURES TAKEN TO KEEP THE INFORMATION SECRET FOR YEARS, TIMES REPORTING THIS, UNDER JUSTICE DEPARTMENT POLICY, GAG ORDERS FOR SUBPOENAS MAY BE RENEWED FOR UP TO A YEAR AT A TIME, SUGGESTING THAT PROSECUTORS WENT TO COURT SEVERAL TIMES TO PREVENT APPLE FROM NOTIFYING THE McGAHNS EARLIER. THEN THERE’S THIS FROM THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION. A TINY DETAIL THAT WOULD STRONGLY SUGGEST THAT THE THEORY THAT THE McGAHNS’ INFORMATION WAS INADVERTENTLY SWEPT UP BY THE MUELLER PROSECUTORS MIGHT BE LESS LIKELY THAN OTHER EXPLANATIONS, THAT IN THE FINAL DAYS OF THE OBSTRUCTION PROBE, PROSECUTORS ASKED McGAHN TO PRODUCE HIS OWN RECORDS TO CORROBORATE HIS COMMUNICATIONS WITH TRUMP AROUND THE FORMER PRESIDENT’S INSTRUCTION TO FIRE MUELLER. IF YOU REMEMBER, THAT WAS ONE OF THE FLASH POINTS OF THE OBSTRUCTION INVESTIGATION. FROM DONALD TRUMP VS. THE UNITED STATES BY MICHAEL SCHMIDT, THE INVESTIGATORS KNEW THAT McGAHN HAD SPOKEN ON THE PHONE WITH TRUMP THAT WEEKEND. MAYBE THEY THOUGHT IF THEY COULD GET McGAHN’S PHONE RECORDS, THEY COULD SHOW THAT TRUMP HAD INDEED BEEN CALLING HIM. PROSECUTOR ANDREW GOLDSTEIN WENT BACK TO McGAHN’S ATTORNEY, BILL BURKE, IN LATE 2018 WITH A HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT. PLEASE TELL McGAHN TO GET THE PHONE RECORDS HIMSELF. THIS PROCESS TOOK SEVERAL WEEKS. BUT FINALLY, McGAHN RECEIVED THEM IN THE MAIL AND SENT THEM THEM IN THE MAIL AND SENT THEM TO BURCK WHO GAVE THEM TO GOLD SOOEN OF THE GOLDSTEIN OF THE MUELLER PROBE. STILL, IT’S JUST A THEORY, A HAUNTING ONE. DID TRUMP SO SUCCESSFULLY AND SO THOROUGHLY THOROUGHLY THOROUGHLY CORRUPT HIS DOJ THAT McGAHN’S RECORDS WERE PURSUED AROUND THE TIME HE BECAME A KEY WITNESS FOR THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION AND DID THE SECRECY AROUND THAT DATA COLLECTION FROM A SITTING WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL WHICH WAS OPERATIONALIZED BY MULTIPLE DOJ ACTORS SIGNAL A COMPLETE PERVERSION OF JUSTICE? ONLY TIME WILL TELL. SPEAKER PELOSI AND SENATE MAJORITY LEADER SCHUMER ARE CALLING FOR HEARINGS ON CAPITOL HILL. ALSO TODAY, NEWS THAT THE TOP DOJ NATIONAL SECURITY OFFICIAL, WHO WOULD HAVE OVERSEEN ANY LEAK INVESTIGATION, IS LEAVING AT THE END OF NEXT WEEK. THE OBLITERATION OF THE RULE OF LAW UNDER THE DISGRACED EX-PRESIDENT IS WHERE WE START THIS HOUR WITH SOME OF OUR FAVORITE REPORTERS AND FRIENDS. THE AFOREMENTIONED "NEW YORK TIMES" WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT MIKE SCHMIDT IS HERE, JEREMY BASH, FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF AT THE CIA AND DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, AND FRANK FIGLIUZZI IS HERE, FORMER FBI ASSISTANT DIRECTOR FOR COUNTERINTELLIGENCE AND HOST OF THE BUREAU PODCAST, LUCKY FOR US, ALL THREE INSTINCT CONTRIBUTORS. MIKE SCHMIDT, TAKE US THROUGH WHAT YOU REPORTED TODAY IN "THE NEW YORK TIMES" ABOUT DON McGAHN, AND HIS WIFE, MRS. McGAHN’S DATA BEING COLLECTED. >> WELL, YOU KNOW, BASICALLY, AS YOU WERE LAYING OUT, THEY FOUND OUT ABOUT THIS THREE YEARS AFTER THE FACT, SO THIS HAPPENED IN FEBRUARY OF 2018. IT’S A PERIOD OF TIME THAT WE NOW KNOW THAT THE FBI AND THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WERE LOOKING AT A RANGE OF FOLKS AND A RANGE OF DIFFERENT LEAK INVESTIGATIONS. IT COULD BE RELATED TO THAT. IT COULD BE RELATED TO SOMETHING ELSE. BUT IT TAKES THREE YEARS FOR THEM TO FIND OUT ABOUT THIS, TO FIND OUT THE FACT THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD ACCESS TO THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION. AND AS YOU WERE SAYING, THE BIGGEST PROBLEM HERE WITH ALL OF THIS IS A PROBLEM OF, WELL, BASED ON WHAT WE KNOW, AND WE DON’T KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS CAME ABOUT, BUT THE BIGGEST PROBLEM THAT WE DO KNOW IS THE PROBLEM OF PERCEPTION. THAT THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT DONALD TRUMP WANTED. IT WAS IN A PERIOD OF TIME IN WHICH DONALD TRUMP WAS CALLING McGAHN A LIAR AND A LEAKER. HE WAS VERY UPSET ABOUT REPORTS THAT McGAHN HAD TOLD MUELLER ABOUT THE ATTEMPTS TO FIRE MUELLER. HE TRIED TO GET McGAHN TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE SUBPOENA WAS ISSUED TO GO BACK ON HIS STORY, AND THAT, UNFORTUNATELY, IS THE MOST THAT WE KNOW ABOUT THIS. IT IS VERY POSSIBLE THAT McGAHN’S RECORDS COULD HAVE BEEN SOAKED UP IN ANOTHER INVESTIGATION, IN ANOTHER LEAK INVESTIGATION. THERE WERE A TON OF LEAKS IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION THAT THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY AND THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT BELIEVED NEEDED TO BE LOOKED AT. SOME OF THEM HAVING NOTHING TO DO WITH DONALD TRUMP, SOME OF THEM HAVING A LOT TO DO WITH DONALD TRUMP. BUT THAT IS WHERE WE SORT OF FIND OURSELVES IN THIS STORY, TRYING TO FIND OUT WHAT IT WAS THAT LED FEDERAL PROSECUTORS TO GO AFTER THESE RECORDS. DID THEY KNOW THAT THE NUMBER AND ADDRESS THAT THEY WERE TARGETING WAS OF McGAHN’S? WAS IT SLOPPY INVESTIGATIVE WORK? INTERESTINGLY, THERE’S A FAIR AMOUNT OF SILENCE FROM THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ON THIS. AS YOU WERE POINTING OUT, MERRICK GARLAND HAS PUT OUT A STATEMENT TODAY ABOUT THIS. THERE IS AN INSPECTOR GENERAL’S INVESTIGATION THAT HAS BEEN REFERRED, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, NO EXPLANATION FROM THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ABOUT HOW THIS HAPPENED. >> MIKE SCHMIDT, IF YOU COULD JUST TAKE US UNDER THE HOOD IN TERMS OF HOW THIS WORKS, I MEAN -- AND I UNDERSTAND THE RESPONSIBILITY OF GIVING THE MOST GENEROUS EXPLANATION TO OUR VIEWERS, SO WE’LL DO THAT. INADVERTENTLY, A SWEEP OF SEIZED DATA THAT YOU SUBPOENA APPLE FOR COLLECTS THE SITTING WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL. THAT JOB IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE ONLY HUMAN BEING WHO TALKS TO THE UNITED STATES JUSTICE DEPARTMENT DURING A FOUR-YEAR PRESIDENTIAL TERM. SURELY SOMEONE AT THE UNITED STATES JUSTICE DEPARTMENT BECAME AWARE OF IT AT SOME POINT, IF NOT AROUND THE ORIGINAL SUBPOENA, WHICH HAD TO HAVE BEEN SIGNED BY SOMEONE AT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, THEN AROUND THE THREE OR FOUR GAG ORDERS THAT WERE RENEWED BASED ON YOUR REPORTING. WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE -- WHAT KINDS OF ROLES ARE INVOLVED IN THAT? >> WELL, I THINK WHAT YOU’RE HITTING ON IS THE NOTION THAT IF THIS WAS A MISTAKE, THEN YOU THINK THAT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WOULD HAVE REACHED OUT TO McGAHN TO SAY, HEY, LOOK, WE WERE LOOKING AT SOMETHING ELSE, YOUR STUFF GOT SOAKED UP IN THIS THING, YOU’RE OBVIOUSLY A VERY IMPORTANT PERSON THAT WAS IN THE GOVERNMENT AT THE TIME, YOU WERE THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT’S CHIEF WITNESS AGAINST THE PRESIDENT AND AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO THE PRESIDENCY, TO DONALD TRUMP’S PRESIDENCY, AT THE TIME. WE JUST WANTED TO GIVE YOU A HEADS UP ON THIS. INSTEAD, THE McGAHNS LEARNING OF THIS THROUGH NOTIFICATION FROM THEIR PROVIDERS OR FROM APPLE OR SUCH. SO, YOU WOULD THINK THAT SOMEONE -- THIS MAY HAVE COME ACROSS SOMEONE’S DESK EARLIER IF IT WAS INADVERTENT. IN TERMS OF PERCEPTION, ONE OF THE UNFORTUNATE THINGS HERE IS THAT HERE WE ARE A FEW WEEKS INTO THIS STORY. WE KNOW THAT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SUBPOENAED OR TRIED TO SUBPOENA RECORDS FROM FIVE SORT OF DIFFERENT ENTITIES. ONE BUCKET OF THOSE PEOPLE WAS THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE, DONALD TRUMP’S, YOU KNOW, BIGGEST ENEMIES, "THE NEW YORK TIMES," "THE WASHINGTON POST," AND CNN, OKAY? SO THOSE WERE THE FIRST THREE. THE NEXT ONE WE KNOW ABOUT IS ADAM SCHIFF, THE PRESIDENT’S CHIEF CRITIC ON CAPITOL HILL WHO WAS LEADING THE INVESTIGATION INTO RUSSIA’S MEDDLING IN THE ELECTION. THE NEXT ONE IS DON McGAHN, THE CHIEF WITNESS AGAINST THE PRESIDENT IN THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION. LOOK, MY GUESS IS THERE’S OTHER SUBPOENAS OUT THERE AND SUCH, BUT THE FIVE THAT WE KNOW ABOUT FIT VERY NEATLY INTO THE CATEGORY OF THE PRESIDENT’S GREATEST ENEMIES, AND THESE ARE NOT ENEMIES THAT DONALD TRUMP TALKED ABOUT BEHIND CLOSED DOORS. THESE ARE ENEMIES THAT DONALD TRUMP TWEETED ABOUT, THAT DONALD TRUMP TALKED ABOUT IN PUBLIC INTERVIEWS, IN PUBLIC STATEMENTS ON THE SOUTH LAWN OF THE WHITE HOUSE, AND IN PRIVATE TO HIS AIDES. AND OBVIOUSLY, BECAUSE OF THAT, THERE IS A LOT OF SKEPTICISM ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED AND HITS ON THE UNDERLYING NOTION THAT WHEN THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES TALKS ABOUT USING THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OR USING HIS POWERS TO GO AFTER HIS RIVALS, DISCLOSURES ABOUT INVESTIGATIONS If you’ve ever tried using the flashlight
on your Apple Watch, you may’ve come across this red screen. Apple has never mentioned why they included
it, but it does serve a useful purpose. And that’s what I’ll explain right now. When using the flashlight on your phone or
even the white flashlight on your Apple Watch, it gives off a pretty bright light may that
not be an issue if you’re alone, but can be pretty disturbing with other people. For example, lying in bed next to someone,
trying to find something you dropped in a movie theater, or just trying to find your
way to the bathroom at night. Also, when using a bright white light in dark
conditions, your eyes are forced to transition from night vision to day vision, and then
back again once you turn the light off. So to address these issues, Apple added a
red flashlight to the Apple Watch. Since the color has some unique qualities
that make it useful in certain situations. Red light doesn’t break your night vision,
which is helpful for someone working in a dark setting. Like an astronomer observing the night sky
while using a red light to reference their star charts. Or a photographer checking their prints in
a dark room. It’s also helpful in the wilderness. Being less disturbing to wildlife and even
attracting less bugs, since they have a harder time seeing red light. But if you’re someone who’s a little less
adventurous, the red flashlight on your Apple Watch still comes in handy. If you’re in bed at night reading, using
the red light is much less distracting to the person sleeping next to you. If you dropped something in a theater, the
red flashlight won’t bother other audience members. Which is why, if your Apple Watch is in Theater
Mode, the red flashlight will appear by default. And if you wake up to use the bathroom at
night but don’t want to break your night vision or interrupt your sleep as much, using
the red light to find your way would be much more comfortable. And just as a bonus, there’s also a strobe
light mode on the Apple Watch, which is great to use during night runs or early morning
walks to increase your visibility for other pedestrians. This is Greg from Apple Explained, thanks

come on work faster work huh we're here let's see working alright so today I'm gonna be I wanted to do this is a live stream on the main channel unfortunately I probably won't be able to because of an internet I fully expect this dream to have a ton of drops in it because spectrum is garbage I've called it one of the problems the calling spectrum is that you're gonna be on hold for about an hour to three hours before you actually get to somebody and typically I don't even think it's on purpose I just think because their system their PBX is even shittier than mine it hangs up on you it drops a lot so you're gonna you have to dedicate a day to dealing with spectrum anytime you have a spectrum issue I did last time I got a new modem barely really did much and again they're the only choice so I don't have a lot of choices when it comes to dealing with spectrum so what I'm doing is I'm gonna record a copy of this and then upload it to the main channel I want it to be able to have it back and forth with people so I was kind of hoping I could do this in the main channel I did a speed test and it I I fully expect the stream to fail halfway through if it does do keep in mind I am recording this and I do plan on uploading a proper edited version of this assuming that this stream completely goes to [ __ ] that being said I wanted to talk about something where I think I got something wrong in a very important way and I want to try and correct that with this video now that I have new information and have had time to sift through all the information that was available me to silent my phone so I was talking about this case in a previous video this is the case the Henrik who's be case where Apple lost lawsuit against independent iPhone repair shop in Norway over unauthorized parts and I did a video about it here on April 17th of last year called Apple Susan and they lose now the idea behind this video is that somebody was ordering screens which were refurbished screens assembled by a third party and that when he imported them they were seized by customs and then Apple wanted or and then Apple went after this guy's repair shop now this is something that was triggering to me because it's something that many people do on a regular basis refurbishing iPhone screens is very common so it's became very difficult around 2015 and get original screens anymore it became very difficult to do so what we were doing is if we fix the customers device we and this LCD was good but the part that makes the picture the glass was bad the part that I was trying to explain to the court in Norway for like the 19 minutes before I just gave up was essentially that the LCD is good the glass is bad you send the screens back to somebody who has the equipment to refurbish them and then you're good and then you know you pay them to refurbish it you get that part back and then use it in another customers device and so on and so forth it's very common so one example well Sonny he has a store and his store is much better than mine when it comes to any sort of iPad screen repair iPhone screen repair he's got all the equipment and all the knowledge to refurbish iPhone screens to a pretty close to factory standard in his shop and I can't do [ __ ] with that I I essentially I am like a monkey this chain we're putting screws in and out and placing a new Zanu with fully assembled screen in the phone I can't do what Sonny does Sonny's not exactly as great as logic board as good at logic board repair as I am so we we trade back and forth services and I often give him screens he'll give me back working screens and we pay him for it it's normal so when I read about this case and I see that somebody's Rhian porting refurbished screens and now Apple is saying well they have a logo on it so that makes it counterfeit my first thing that I think is that's [ __ ] so we look at this over here and it says they were refurbished screens assembled by a third party in Hong Kong and so I did my video saying if you have a part and then you send it to China to be refurbished and they refurbish it and then they send back to you you can't say that it's counterfeit the same way that I cannot say that a Ford Focus is now counterfeit because I put different brake pads in it that's not the way that this works now I got to testify in this case on I believe it was the fifth or the sixth or something like that I did my testimony here you saw it all at live at 4:00 a.m. I was not exactly as awake because I usually am but I got the document Haitian for that case about one day before I did my testimony so I'm reading through all the documentation drying and I like dot the i's cross the t's figure out what all the information is that I may not have had as a result of the emails that I had back and forth with Henrik and his attorney and also the news coverage but what did I miss let's get into all the nitty-gritty facts so I figure this is gonna be easy I got an invoice from him purchasing and I have an impact that states screens that got sent to China let's see what Apple has to say let's say what he has to say so I take a look at it and there's an invoice for purchasing screens from I believe it was Jack Telecom I forget the exact company I think it was Jack Telecom so there's an invoice purchasing screens from Jack Telecom and the invoice says new OEM the box is saying new OEM and then there's another sheet that looks like a you know a sheet that you would expect when you're selling screens to somebody else so for example I can have my screens refurbished by Sonny and then he gives them back to me and I pay him to refurbish it or I simply give my screens to Sonny and then he will give me a sheet that says these are all the LCDs that worked these are the LCDs that didn't work these are the LCDs that work or copy and these are the ones where the only thing useful was the frame so he'll give me a breakdown of what I gave him and then he'll tell me how much money he can give me for each one so I saw a sheet whereby I'm Henricks company with selling screens to some a company in Asia then there is another sheet for a totally different company that says I am buying new OEM LCD screens so the first thing that I'm wrong about here the first thing that I am wrong about is the idea that these were being sent to China to be refurbished or that this was advertised as refurbished to begin with because when I look at every single piece of news coverage on this case online it all says that they were either being refurbished or that they were refurbished when the invoice now that could potentially be the case that they may be made out of refurbished parts but that does beg the question of why the invoice says new and OEM and if parts were being sent to China to be refurbished it then also muddies the water because the company that was buying the screens was separate from the company that was selling the screens and that piece of documentation that I saw look like a piece of documentation that was for selling screens to another to a vendor rather than a sheet for having his own LCDs refurbished by that vendor and that is that paints a very different picture than what it is that I set in my video so when I said in my video if somebody sends screens to somebody and then has them refurbished that's not counterfeiting I agree with that I agree that there's nothing wrong with that but that does not appear to be what occurred in this case now then I looked through Apple's evidence and apples evidence says that this Apple logo on a device it's not that Yuri imported something with an Apple logo it's that Yuri imported something that has an Apple logo that we never put there to begin with and that's a very different argument so if I send parts to China to be refurbished and then they refurbish the LCD and send it back to me it's still going to have the original Apple logo on the flex cable because it's still it's the original part of course it's still gonna have the logo it's not like we are going above and beyond to to scrape that off you know you don't scrape the Ford logo off a car when you replace the brakes however if you buy a product from China and it says new OEM it should have the Apple logo that was there originally now technically here's the sad part is that this would still get seized by customs if it had a logo on it whether it is a badly printed knockoff [ __ ] logo or the actual logo that the factories were were putting on there in China when they were making the original it still would've gets seized by customs so this is somewhat of a red herring however it does break down the arguments in favor of the repair side of it because you know why D why is there a fake logo on the product to begin with why is that product sold as new OEM if it is actually refurbished that is was really important information this is information that I really wish that I had when I did that video it was really important information that I wish I had when I discussed this case prior and for me to not tell you that information now that I know it that I have the documentation in front of me that would be me holding myself to the standard of Fox News or CNN and I in there any people who've said well Lewis you're beating yourself up over this you didn't have this information how could you have even had access to this information before was sent to you by the individuals involved in the case a day before you asked to testify but if I say well I didn't know that's why I didn't say that I'm essentially holding myself to the standards of TV cable TV news and that would make me [ __ ] sick to my stomach or do they you know like post this little tiny correction in the bottom of the video no I think it's important to do a video where I say I was wrong I did not have all the facts involved in this case all the facts were not presented as a result of it I said things that were not correct and I'm wrong then I'm sorry and I [ __ ] up and that's important it's not a small [ __ ] it's a big [ __ ] up because it makes the people who were actually doing refurbishing it it puts those people in the same pot now when it came to this particular case what it came down to the nitty-gritty that it really came down to his a those Apple logos were crossed out so even if they were [ __ ] Apple logos even if they were Apple logos that were you know drawn on there by a [ __ ] toddler with his little pencil it shouldn't matter because they were crossed out that is the way Norwegian law works that is the way it was presented to me as how the Norwegian law works by attorneys in Norway and that is what should matter the second thing is does that type of copyright and trademark apply to logos placed inside flex cables of internal products that customers don't see in that case henrik is still technically correct within the bounds of the law he still technically did not do something wrong by norwegian law because a those logos whether or not they were real were crossed out and blacked out and B those low it does answer the question of are you actually allowed to copyright it to put your copyright and Trademark in in like size 2 font inside flex cables of pieces that are not customer-facing that go inside the product and in that way Henrik was correct however it does vastly change the story it changes the way many of you would have reacted to that story and that is what's important even though he is still within the bounds of the law that does not mean that it would have elicited the same reaction from you had the actual truth been there from the beginning and laid out the way it was laid out to me in that documentation now to be clear this is not any sort of thing that was hidden from the court this is not something that was hidden from the case these were all documents all of the these were all documents that were submitted that were a part of this trial the entire time so it's not like I had some special information this is information that was presented to me one day before testifying at 4:00 a.m. and I was like going over this stuff at like 1:00 or 2:00 in the morning before doing my case because I have no time to go over this but I did have time to ask all the relevant questions now I thought that I was going to be questioned in some way shape or form based on this I thought okay the end of the attorney for Apple is getting up he's going to ask me if this was a refurbished part why is it sold as new OEM on the box in the invoice if this is a refurbished part why does it have the original Apple logo printed there with a marker over rather than this logo that we claimed was not printed by us and that attorney appeared to not do his job in any way shape or form and ask questions that actually would have bolstered Apple's case and made Apple's case look better he simply held up a little piece of paper and said it seems like you have problems with Apple because they destroyed $10,000 worth of your merchandise with a software update and have been lying to customers for three years on their own forums about how data recovery is impossible is that you well yes yes I am pissed off that they lie to their customers on a regular basis and I am aggravated that they took perfectly working merchandise and with an operating system update waive their magic wand and said poof doesn't work anymore yes that is a fairly legitimate point but that had nothing nothing to [ __ ] do with the case because the thing is had he actually asked relevant questions the Apple attorney would have had an excellent and better bolstered case for why this was wrong but he didn't do that because he's a shitty attorney and because I actually have some shred of integrity and don't want to simply obfuscate things just because it doesn't push my narrative I'm kind of doing his job for him but now technically I am NOT an expert whether an Apple logo is original technically they did cover up the Apple logo with a marker and then the only way they were able to see that the Apple logo was there was to use alcohol or something to remove it perhaps that logo was damaged in the process of using the alcohol and the q-tip or whatever to remove it maybe that made the logo look like it's poorly printed so if I'm saying there's a logo on my shirt and let's say I cover up that logo with some silly putty or something and then you really scrub my shirt to get it off obviously you're gonna affect the way the logo looks underneath I cannot say beyond a shadow of a doubt that that's a fake logo I could all I can say is that that's what Apple said the logo was Apple said the logos on those screens we're not the original one and based on the then there is that issue that I have with them saying well these are made of refurbished parts then if that's the case a why are you presenting a document that shows you selling screens to China and then presenting another document from a totally different Chinese company that says I bought new new ones that doesn't make sense and the only thing that comes to mind is and I hate to say this is are you simply trying to confuse a court system of ninety five year olds by overwhelming them with technical evidence that they're not going to be able to read maybe if I'm simply being a pessimist but that's what comes to mind why is it that me selling screens to company a has anything to do with me buying news screens from Company B now if I was sending screens to Company A and they sent me a document saying here is the breakdown of the what stuff that you got here is what is fixed and here is oh here's what is fixable here's what's not fixable now we're gonna send them back to you fixed if you pay us that documentation would then be relevant but if you're selling screens to company a and then six months later buying screens from Company B that transaction where you sold screens to Company A in in my mind has no relevance to the case and I remember asking about that and the answer that I got was well that stuff doesn't matter because what really matters here is that the logos were crossed out on the product and that that means that the there was no damage of trademark now that could be technically true and as I explained there is no repair shop on plan that I know of that actually puts effort in to remove the Sharpie over the Apple logo on anything before putting it into a customer device I have never removed if I see sharp being on a logo even if it's on a [ __ ] battery I don't remove that before I put it into the customer device because it doesn't make a difference and what I was able to sell it makes no difference and what I'm able to sell I can still sell a product to a customer I don't need an Apple logo on to sell it I don't need an Apple logo on a hard drive cable to sell it to a customer I tell them this will fix your problem I will warranty it if it doesn't work the way that you want it to work you come back here and we make it work white or we were funding that's what matters the Apple logo on it I don't care it doesn't add value to me I'm not sitting here going through my box of [ __ ] screens yeah you know when I if I buy a thousand screens with a little q-tip and the alcohol rubbing off the markers that I can now sell it as an apple product the idea that we are purposely trying to represent these products as if they were had Tim Cook's blessing that to me is [ __ ] I'm not trying to do that no repair shop I know is trying to do that because that is not where the value is in this business it's not maybe that's where the value is in the Chinese seller that's trying to sell this [ __ ] and pass it off as original when it's not to other people in China maybe in their market it's relevant in my market it's not relevant but I could see why Apple would be aggravated I can definitely see why Apple would be aggravated and pissed off if they see well somebody's importing parts that have Apple logos and it's not an Apple logo that we ever put there somebody else put that Apple logo there and they're advertising it as new and they're advertising it as OEM and if Jack Telecom is watching this my question would be for them what the [ __ ] five years ago I did a video recommending that people buy from you I recommended people buy from Jack Telecom for a good reason for all I know henrik may have seen that video and decided to buy from Jack Telecom for that [ __ ] reason that I did a video recommending Jack Telecom I recommend that people buy from Jack telecom because I think Jack telecom is an excellent vendor of screens at the very least at the time I did the video in 2013 or 2014 and all the vendors I had purchase from when I had a professional supply company from 2011 through 2014 they were the ones that had the lowest defect rate the screens always fit in the phone properly none of that the frame is thicker [ __ ] like you had a lot of the iPhone fours and fives or the frame was thicker and wouldn't fit properly you admitted or the glass would lift up or the touch was they had the best quality that you could get and it was important to me that they had the best quality you can get and they had good prices on the best quality you can get and they had a low defect rate and they honored our mas you sent them back and stuff that didn't work no questions asked to send you good ones I forget what I'm going into a tangent here and my chat is not being do I have mods in this why is my chat like such a shitstorm why is there so much spam where mods hi hi one second sorry this part sucks I have to ban spam oh my god Lee I'm getting overloaded with spam holy moly okay looks like piernas was actually doing a good job here anyway so I recommend that people buy screens from Jack Telecom because they're a good company so if you're watching this Jack Telecom e if it is the case that you put Apple logos in the products when they were not there to begin with if you're selling screens that did not have Apple logos but then you put your own Apple logo on it what the [ __ ] I recommend to people buy from you that sucks stop doing that stop [ __ ] doing that we don't need fake-ass Apple logos on products I don't need them to sell them to a customer I sell a customer based on I grab the best parts I can at the best quality that I can at the time what if that's refurbished great if that's knockoff great if that's new great if it's original great but it's not your [ __ ] job to put logos on flex cables if that was not the original LCD and if it's batteries if it comes to anything because we have to we have to work on this as an industry we can't simply bash Apple for everything although bashing Apple can be fun there there are companies that do decide we are simply going to put an Apple logo on something because we think it's going to sell better we are going to make it look like this came from Apple when it didn't and I think we as a business have to a push vendors if they are doing this big if can't confirm it but if they are doing this stop [ __ ] doing that and be stop buying from people who do that it's something that we actually have to make part of the process when we purchase has to be part of the okay so what is the quality what is the price what is the turnaround time but also by the way are you going to print [ __ ] crap on the product that is going to result in me having a difficult time importing it because if your product has a logo that was there originally fine I don't care but if the product did not have a logo and then you decided to make it more difficult to import it by putting on a logo on it that did not belong here that does not have to be there then [ __ ] you stop doing that and it's something that we as an industry are going to have to start valuing and it's going to be important to Prague I'd love whether this case decides that a logo on an internal component is not a logo that is valid so I'll read some of your questions and let's see what we go from there most of my chat is completely useless garbage spam but it looks like much of his belated thank you for integrity and correcting yourself so we're in today's world yes thank you I don't think I have much integrity if I did I would have actually had this information to begin with I don't know how I would have gotten it but I would have found it Apple stole the logo from the Beatles record company the only way they were allowed to use it whether they stayed away from the music industry and we see how that Sallah that promise was you know I didn't know about the Beatles record company but I looked that up no one cares about trademark all they want is that the part working is good enough exactly that is what I care about I don't give a [ __ ] about an Apple logo being printed on the LCD because it's simply not a metric I've had customers ask me so how does the LCD look what is your warranty what does it cost I've never in 10 years had somebody say let me look at the flex cable to examine whether it has an Apple logo it's not one of the key performance metrics that matters when determining legitimacy in the eyes of a customer and it's not something that matters when when selling the product so for me I don't care if it has a logo which is precisely why if and big if if come in China um I recommend our pudding Apple logos on products that did not originally have Apple logos [ __ ] stop doing that and one of the things that bothers me when it comes to most political or social movements is that people are very unwilling to call out bad activity within their own group because they think it will not because the thing they think that their entire cause will be just tossed out or what's the word I'm looking for it hindered their progress will be hindered by the fact that they've called out bad activity within their own group I see it the exact opposite way I think that if you don't call out bad activity or if you don't call out bad actors that or bad practices within your industry then it winds up getting everybody painted with the same brush so again if I send screens to China to have them refurbished and then I reinforce them I would like for that to be considered separate from a vendor that stamps Apple logos on products that did not originally have Apple logos sells them as new OEM and then gets claimed in a court case that they were assembled from refills yet do I know exactly how these were assembled No do I know if that Apple logo that was printed incorrectly was damaged by the process of removing the Sharpie paint that was covering it no but the idea of them all having identical serial numbers was all the parts having identical serial numbers that kind of makes it look like it's just printed on there to make it look legit when it's not Lewis has integrity would be a bad politician no I would be a bad politician for many other reasons I don't think I have much integrity the spam is ridiculous yes it is we have any good questions I need your help and I'm in California can you fix the 2012 to early 2013 MacBook Pro that beat several times and won't turn on okay I'm gonna guess that beat is bad autocorrect for beep potentially yes if it's a Retina maybe if it's not a Retina you take out the RAM from the non-working Ram slot and put it in the working RAM slot what is the stream about you're not paying attention I can't help you [Music] if Apple loses this time do you think they will appeal again I'm not sure because again while I can understand what their point is and that this product has a logo on it that was put on by somebody else and you imported it I can understand the Norwegians Court we're saying eh once they put a Sharpie over it for the importing into the country they were essentially saying that doesn't matter that doesn't exist so you unearthing that logo by scrubbing the product is is [ __ ] and there's the other point of is it even is it even legally enforceable for you to put your copyright in your trademark on the inside of a product where than the outside of the products again a customer is going to look and say this is an iPhone based on the Apple logo on the outside of it do you have to have your do you is it okay to put your flex get your logo on everything on the inside so that you can have come big control over it lewis's testimony was still accurate is up to the courts to apply to the case yes everything I said was accurate I was asked very stupid questions in my opinion so what is the difference between new refurbished and knockoff I answered that completely honestly do did I have access to looking at the screens that were involved in the case I answered honestly I said no do I have a problem with Apple answered honestly I said yes why is it that you are a better price than Apple authorized service centers I answered honestly what I'm allowed to fix things that they're not why are you not Apple authorized I answered honestly I would not be allowed to do a lot of the work that I do and I still believe that this entire situation which I think has many good actors and bad actors is Kriya is made worse by the fact that Apple I allows to no access to parts room and internal documentation even if I wanted to apply to become an Apple authorized service provider with somebody else in the business name there's a they're not accepting new AAS PS in many regions and further you need specific machinery in order to do these screen repair as I recall for a good amount of time you needed this horizon machine to do it not only did it cost a lot of money but they were not even selling it to most independent repair shops so even if you were an Apple authorized service provider you would have to offer your customer one to two we turn around time mailing the iPhone back and forth to get it fixed which is completely ridiculous and not something that is viable I am NOT saying and further there's also the idea of how am I supposed to I'm getting punished because I decided to purchase something that was advertised as new so I can't buy out screens from Apple I can't buy screens from the factories that make them for Apple I can't buy them either I'm forced to buy them from these vendors so I message a vendor that I see good ratings for on the intern you got to see this from the point of view of the individual like henrik so somebody like henrik is doing what i'm doing so henrik says well I want to offer iPhone screen repair because it's not being done well by the companies in my country and it's not being done by very well by the stores in my country maybe they have long wait times maybe they just don't do it maybe they mail it off well maybe they just say no so I'm gonna go online I'm gonna find a reputable company and I want to buy the best screen cuz that's what Henrik did Henrik did not buy copy he did not buy he did not pay for copy he did not pay for refurbished he did not pay for a low-quality copy or anything like that Henrik paid for new OEM and the pricing in the invoice that he got was for new OEM his intention was to purchase the best quality screen for his customer that's the fucked-up part here so Henrik goes online and says I want to buy the best quality screen for my customer he finds a company that is considered reputable he finds a company that charges a little more than the others get jacked Telecom typically at a price premium which is why my supply business reselling a lot of their parts that not do well because people don't want to pay top dollar all the time but he and when he imports them he is now punished because there is an Apple logo that is covered over on a how is he supposed to know without actually visiting China further is it does it make sense to put all of the what's the word I'm looking for all of the liability on the individual on the small business doing the import what if the logos look perfect what if this what if the serial numbers and the logos look perfect but the chemistry is than the oleophobic coating was improper is he are we now supposed to be doing chemistry tests do we need to hire a chemical engineer at every single independent repair shop to see if the chemistry used in the oleophobic coating matches the original so that we know that it's genuine that's not realistic it's not something that we are set up to do maybe a company CSAT SWAT maybe SESAC can do that they got the money to employ five hundred people although I imagine the five hundred people working there probably have a lower salary than the twelve people working here but it's a joke but for another video but it's not something that we can reasonably be expected to do this is a and this entire problem could be alleviated if a it was eat they would sell parts B they would allow the people who make parts for them to sell to us C stopped being dicks and putting a logo on the inside of everything again like why is this problem created in the first place I'm not saying that it's right nor am i saying that the way the case was portrayed as I'm sending screens to China to get refurbished or I'm purchasing refurb from China when you're actually buying something it says new OEM and it has an Apple logo on it that may not be original I'm not saying that's right but let's let's like zoom out here and try to figure out why that's happening in the first place I'm nuts okay speaking of chemistry how is Erica erica is doing very well thank you very much right so I just drop my mouse let's see what are the rest of the questions I have here can we if it integrity requires Chinese cables because apple cables aren't available Thank You being transparent more companies should have the same mindset it's hard to know things are misrepresented yes it is and that's the other thing it's easy to have a bias forum where you is where you don't think that what is being presented is misrepresented if you're used to dealing with bull sugars on a regular basis when I see Apple I'm used to dealing with a company that doesn't bother to tell customers that their phone is slowing down because of a battery I'm used to dealing with a company that contacts me and says hey I saw you made a video where you showed how to replace a fuse that commonly blows on our products can you just take it down I'm used to dealing with a company that I'm used to dealing with a company that issues an update that just destroys screens that don't have the exact EDID code that won't tell us how to program an EDID code over DisplayPort into the screen or that won't sell a screen I'm used to dealing with a company that says it's going to cost you $2000 when you have a [ __ ] bent pin on your LCD connector I don't that's the other thing why is it that I assume the worst of Apple and the best of somebody else because every single day I'm bombarded with evidence that Apple did the I do there's no good reason for me to assume goodwill of you you know we're dealing we're talking about a business that pays over almost a hundred thousand dollars for a community support moderator to delete posts every single time somebody says data recovery may be possible don't throw away your phone call out bad actors making a group look bad yes do you speak for the part in it part trade and comment do you buy the fakes yourself I try to avoid buying fakes so here's the way this works for people who are not aware I will message my vendor and say I want the best quality of this I am NOT reselling these I'm not taking $25 screens and trying to put them on eBay for $26 that's not how I make a living I make a living by doing repairs that never come back so I make a living by taking the $25 part charging 70 to 90 dollars to put it in and then praying that if that part works that colors are good the screen is good it doesn't crack easier than the original that it never comes back get me the best quality thing now when it arrives I don't have a way of telling if it's a yeah it's about time to open actually get out of here hello you're the twelve yet let's see are we actually open its eleven fifty seven so you have three minutes what's up okay so so J she'll help you so we don't actually know unless we get it and it's clearly obviously for so sometimes I will get something and it will look like an original like the retina batteries that I get I can look and I can see this has a this has the original control are you using a Texas system in some higher-end controller or are you using some controller from some no brand coming that's a great way of telling if the battery that you bought is actually original or [ __ ] and that's one of the reasons that I thought that the batteries I was getting I were getting were good because I looked in the controller was the same control that's in the original that you don't see in knockoffs now if I get something in and I see the controller is different the font is not even remotely close to the label and that the but you put an Apple logo there that barely looks like it was drawn there then that's where you tell the supplier you didn't send me what I asked for you did not send me what I asked for what's wrong with that okay so back to what I was discussing so if you if I receive something and it's very clearly not original then I'm going to say what the [ __ ] it's not most people are not asking hey I would like to buy something that has Apple logos on it to make importing it more difficult even when it's not original because what a repair shop is mostly concerned about is is it going to get through customs and is a good quality if it is a good quality knockoff I don't want it to have Apple logos on it because that's just gonna make it more difficult to import you understand now if I'm buying something new that's supposed to be the original I care not not really about the Apple logo I don't give a [ __ ] if you spray I prefer that you [ __ ] scrape it off just to not have issues with customs but if I buy that and I paid for new and original and it shows up and I can tell that the labeling is just looks like it was done by a toddler and has an Apple logo on it that's where there is an issue and yeah there are a lot of vendors that are gonna sell you cheap crappy ship the thing is you don't and one of the big problems when you start in this business is you don't know who those people are until you've already given them your money so that first one thousand or three thousand or five thousand dollar order is gonna have you like biting your teeth like crazy because you don't know if you're getting good stuff or bad stuff that's why I started my supply company in 2011 because I didn't want to have to deal with it and it's something it's one of the reasons one of the selling points was I am using the parts that I'm selling you it's not simply that I'm selling them to get feedback or whatever and if I sell one person one that doesn't work I just refine them and hope I don't get bad feedback it's I am a repair shop I am buying these things for use from my own clients who are going to cut my balls off if I give them something that doesn't work and I also happen to sell them to you so that was the selling point behind rossmann supply in 2011 until it went out of business so that's so no I would not but the thing is I do like Jack Telecom and I would typically so I would ask Jack Telecom I want the best quality iPhone screen you could get me they would say new OEM so I would be in that exact same boat that henrik is in if I were buying from that same vendor at the same time don't beat yourself up over new information learn to make a change and have a great day we'll try see just so your internet is $409 what a joke you're telling me Thank You Jamie Richard ultimate this is a right to repair thing making um parts available for reasonable price offices it does and I don't want to say that I don't want to force a company to do things that are they don't want to do but at the same time I want if you're gonna if if you're gonna expect to not be forced to do things that you also kind of to stop being a dick you kinda have to if you want freedom you have to also not be a dick I think to some extent Obed rivera dollar thank you very much oh bit how the kitty is dealing with Erika Kitty's love there there's almost no counterfeit market Williams stuff available only connoisseur by counterfeit stuff then that's the thing it's about you not knowing that it's counterfeit when you buy it most repair shops don't actually know that and again when it comes to something like the serial number so when I get these parts in do I have am I gonna read the QR code off of every single LCD flex to see if the serial numbers match further do I even have a way of telling if a serial number is valid let's say that I do what they did in that case so in the case and documentation they said these serial numbers are not our products how am I supposed to know do I have a database that I can cross-check these with can I go to support Apple comm type in the serial number of the iPhone screen that I got from this vendor and see if it matches up to your manufacturing really I guess that's not my problem no [Music] selling fakes as bad practice for your inter pares business yes why not design and create your own swivel laptop or phone because I'm a college dropout who can't even get his ebike controller to work have I covered every question let's see if I've covered every question before getting out of here why do you want to waste your time and knowledge by applying to companies that support ten-year-old certification that is outdated I don't understand what that's a good fall response to thank you for investing and good audio equipment thank you for the $5 today there's a video from strange parts where he was comparing batteries for an iPhone and there were stalls in the Shenzhen market willing to delete the logo upon request even if they were genuine yes and that's the thing I want to see more of that I think that there has to be a shift within the Chinese companies where they that are selling these products to realize that the American and consumers of their products which are the repair shop - do not care if it has a logo and it's up to us to tell them that if we want that to occur remember no logos no problem with customs you know what to worry about whether the logo is crossed out whether the logo is original or not because one of the thing conversations that I remember having with Mark Schaefer at iPad rehab is he said he was speaking with customs individuals at one point in time and the way that they explained it to him is you could actually buy an iPhone at the Apple store on 9th Avenue take the screen off of it go take a trip to China mail that back to yourself and it would get seized in his area because of our strict they are and that's that is a problem but that is separate from what happened here from the evidence that I see in front of me and that's what's important to clarify ok I don't have many questions so maybe if I get interesting comments to this video I'll do a follow-up stream and it looks like my internet actually worked go figure alright see you all in the next video thank you for watching and as always I hope you learned something - Oy, mate.
This you? - I believe it is. - Wicked.
You coaching football. You are a legend for
doing something so stupid. I mean, it's mental.
They're gonna murder you. - This is a bit of news from
the other side of the Atlantic. AFC Richmond announced
the hiring of their new manager American football coach Ted Lasso. - You are an American who is now
in charge of a football club despite possessing very little
knowledge of the game. -Ooh!
I know that AFC Richmond is gonna give you
everything they got, win or lose. - Or tie.
- Right! Y'all do ties here. - You don't know what you're doing!
You don't know what you're doing! - Did you see that?
He must be from England, yeah? - Wales.
- Is that another country? - Yes and no.
- How many countries are in this country? - Four.
- Four. - Like it or not, Richmond
are changing the way we do things, and from now on,
that way is the Lasso way. (car horn honks) - Hey, look! This car's got
an invisible steering wheel! (car horn honks) - What you're doing is irresponsible. This club actually means
something to this town. - You don't think I see that
every day out there on the streets? - Are you kidding me? I think that's what it's all about,
embracing change. - Same team! - Being brave. - Your decision to bench Jamie
was a masterstroke. - I don't think we're allowed to
talk like that at work anymore. ♪ You got no fear of the underdog ♪ - For me, success is not about
the wins and losses. It's about helping these young fellas be the best versions of themselves

[POP] ♪ apple is getting ready to redesign the apple watch this year with a brand new design new display and a faster processor but is this really going to be the year the apple watch takes that next step as the ultimate health device or will you have to wait a little bit longer hey what's going on everyone greg here and we have a lot of information regarding the apple watch series 7 that i have yet to go over including a new report from john prosser going over the design of the series 7 as well as mark german's reporting on what features we should expect to make its way to the apple watch series 7 as well as future apple watch models so if you aren't subscribed already like the 70 to 80 of you that watch my channel well do me a favor and hit the subscribe button to get even more apple news videos like this one and help me reach my 200 000 subscriber goal i mean we're so close now we're just like 25 000 away all right thank you so much and let's get back to the video so the last time i was able to tell you about the apple watch we talked about the possibility of a new design that would mimic the design language of so many of apple's other products from the ipad pro to the iphone 12 and even the new 24-inch imac with their flat sided design naturally i speculated that this type of flatter design would also make sense on the apple watch and it looks like the series 7 will be giving us just that a new design with flatter sides as well as some changes to the speaker placement which now looks like it will have two longer parallel strips again it wasn't really too hard to read the room here this is the design direction that all of apple's products seem to be going in and it just makes sense for them to carry that design language forward to the apple watch as well but don't worry it appears that apple has even more in store than just flatter sides as mark german from bloomberg has also said that apple is testing a model with thinner display borders and less screen bezel and a new lamination technique that will bring the display closer to the front cover the changes to this design will also make the apple watch slightly thicker but according to german it is going to be in a way that is not noticeable to the user so design wise this is sounding like a pretty big update to the apple watch the last time we received a major design update was with the series 4 and it was a huge improvement over the past models this year sounds like it could potentially be even bigger because although the series 4 you know shrunk the display bezels the overall sides and overall design of the watch looked similar compared to the previous iterations however one thing that was great about the series 4 was how much thinner it was compared to the series 3. i'm hoping the overall increase in thickness on this rumored series 7 really isn't noticeable like the report says because one of the issues i had with the series 3 was fitting it under long sleeve shirt cuffs so i haven't had that issue with the series 6 and i would hate for that issue to reappear on the series 7. furthermore we should also expect some new colors for this year's apple watch and this might be a yearly trend now with how apple seems to have an exclusive new color with every new iphone model and with the series 6 we got red and blue color options for the first time and according to prosser this year series 7 might receive an exclusive new green color i've been saying for a long time now that the apple watch aluminum models the one that you know most users buy should come in even more color options than the higher end options and it looks like apple is doing just that i hope they continue to keep the red and blue color options in the lineup however and that this new green color is just another choice to go alongside it and give us even more options alright so while the design of the apple watch series 7 is likely to be the standout reason to upgrade there's still going to be some new features on the inside as well first of all a faster processor obviously we expect the apple watch to get a speed bump every year but that isn't always true because when we got the apple watch series 5 that apple watch actually had the same processing power as the series 4. there was no usual year-over-year bump but in german's report he specifically calls out a faster processor for this year's model which will likely be called you guessed it the s7 chip the apple watch at this point is already plenty fast but any improvements they can make to speed is welcome and gives headroom for future features another additional chip for this year will be apple's u1 chip for ultra wideband functionality this should work the same way as all of apple's other u1 enabled products and you should be able to track and find your apple watch if it's lost the same way that you can do with your air tags or other u1 enabled devices and this is a cool little upgrade there's a few times i place my watch down somewhere after coming home or you know after a workout just before showering or something like that and i'll misplace it momentarily and then spend like five minutes looking for it having the u1 built in means i can pull up my iphone and get accurate pinpoint directions to where my watch is even inside of my house it could also mean you know using your watch to find stuff too so if you have other u1 enabled devices like your air tags or your phone then you can take your watch look at it and then maybe get those pinpoint directions just like with you know your phone and air tags that you know i don't know why i'm overthinking this so much it's just going to be an easier way to help you find your products and now you can use that feature on your watch now again i expect the main focus this year to be on the design of the apple watch and it looks like a lot of expected rumored features are unfortunately going to be pushed back another year german reports that apple planned to include a body temperature sensor in this year's model but it looks like that feature is being pushed back to the series 8 or the 2022 model of the apple watch and other long rumored features like the blood sugar sensor that would monitor glucose levels and be the holy grail of health technologies for users with diabetes apparently that is also unlikely to be ready for commercial launch for several more years so not even next year's model and that really bums me out because we've been hearing so much about the apple watch being able to read glucose levels for so long now and it's been kind of one of those rumors you would hear about at the beginning of every new apple watch development cycle and you know this would be groundbreaking life-changing technology if apple can figure out how to non-invasively take sugar level readings from a device you wear on your wrist that would be amazing so we really shouldn't be surprised that the technology isn't quite ready yet but i was just really holding out hope we would see it available for this year's watch or at least next year but it still sounds like it's a little far out finally to wrap this up i did a video covering some early leaks for an explorer edition of the apple watch that would feature a rubberized body that is more durable and may even come with exclusive features like longer battery life although it was initially planned to be launched this year german is reporting that this explorer edition is also being pushed back again into 2022. we also are hearing rumors for the first time about an updated version to the apple watch sc the cheaper version of the apple watch that came out alongside the series 6. german says that again the sc update will skip this year as well so no update for the se this year hopefully we get a price drop on it but we should expect to see some further changes to the sc model in 2022 but german also says that plans are not finalized and like always these are just rumors so plans could change before launch honestly it's not unreasonable to expect all of these delays especially in the face of this global chip shortage that i've been talking about on my channel for the past few months now and it looks like a lot of apple's products and plans are being derailed for these timely releases but yeah i am really excited to get a redesign of the apple watch and i'm looking forward to seeing what that looks like hopefully sometime this fall but let me know in the comments below what do you think of the new flat sided design for this rumored apple watch series 7 do you like it or do you prefer the current design that we have now also if you like this video be sure to give me a like if you want to see more from the channel help me reach that 200 000

It comes in 7 colors. We're no strangers to surprises from Apple, the company has shocked us
before. There it is, right there. I just take my finger and slide it across. Right? Wanna see that again. Very thin. Looks just like this. The question is, what's next? What shocking thing could Apple introduce? Now get ready for the iCar? What's your take on the resurgence of this Apple automobile rumor? Just imagine Tim Cook taking the stage there before a live audience and
introducing an Apple car. We have confirmed from multiple sources that Apple is in discussions
with Hyundai Kia to build an Apple car. For years, automakers have been trying to integrate your phone into your
car, and now it feels like this has been turned on its head. It's integrating your car essentially into your phone. Rumors of an Apple car started in 2014 with more details flooding the news
cycle in 2015. We've seen this kind of reporting in the past with Apple, and then nothing
happens. If Apple does end up producing a car, it's not going to be easy. Take it from someone who knows a thing or two about starting a car
company. Elon Musk himself has said it was harder than launching a rocket. So, I mean, there it pretty much is. It's important to say that, while Tim Cook has confirmed that Apple is
working on a driverless car, we don't know many details about it at all. During a shareholders meeting with Tim Cook in 2016, he said news about the
car project will be, quote, like Christmas Eve for a while. Apple is one of the most valuable companies in the world, and it could
become massively more valuable if it can make a splash in cars. The global auto and mobility market is worth about $10 trillion compared to
the measly $715 billion smartphone market. The thought of Tesla and what Tesla had shown it could do gave people in
Silicon Valley this idea that maybe building cars wasn't as hard as everybody always thought. There was this new hope that maybe new entrants could arrive and that was
going to be very bad for Detroit. So here's what we know so far and what we might be able to expect
in the future from the Apple Car. Reuters reported in December of 2020 that Apple was looking to start
production of its car by 2024, but the vision of an automobile developed inside of Apple well before
then. Steve Jobs was reportedly considering the idea back in 2008, but the auto
industry was looking grim. The Big Three are asking the federal government for between $7 and
$18 billion each. Bankruptcy at this point in time would be cataclysmic for the economy. I really believe that. Besides, Apple had just launched the iPhone in 2007
and was on its way to redefining the smartphone and the Apple brand. Fast forward to 2015 and it turns out Apple reportedly already had hundreds
of workers assigned to a secret project called Project Titan. There was two things already going on: Google was working on a self-driving
car and Tesla, this small startup in Silicon Valley, was gaining more and more
attention for its cars. In the time since, Apple has made some interesting
investments and partnerships; the company gave a billion dollars to Chinese Uber competitor Didi Chuxing in
2016, which strengthened Apple's ties to the mobility industry and self-driving
technology boom. Talent from BlackBerry, NASA and others have been commissioned for the
project. Even former Tesla employees have been courted to Project Titan, including
former Tesla auto pilot, powertrain, mechanical design, firmware engineers and global supply chain
managers. That certainly raised some eyebrows. Musk called it the Tesla graveyard in 2015. When Apple first got into this, a lot of people in the car business were
really afraid that their lunch was about to get eaten. The past six years of speculation have been a roller coaster; Apple's building a car, Apple's not building a car,
Apple's building the guts of a car. And recently, sources told CNBC that Apple will be manufacturing an
autonomous car with Hyundai Kia in Georgia. And now that might be out, too. Pump the brakes. Korean car makers Hyundai and Kia saying they are not
currently in talks with Apple to develop a car. Quite a few years ago, and it was Project Titan, it was so
exciting and everyone was talking about it, then it felt like it died off. And then I feel like had gone through a few iterations of being
resurrected,and then now I feel like all of a sudden everyone is talking about it. Apple stock got a bump after Reuters reported Apple could launch its car by
2024. The stock jumped again on the heels of the news that Hyundai Kia could be
partnering to produce the car in Georgia. Only we still don't have many clues at all about what it's going to be or
what it's going to look like. Tech companies are looking for the next screen in your life to make money
off of, and the bet in the hope is that it's in the car. Reports thus far have been speculation about an electronic vehicle with
better battery technology, autonomous driving technology and a signature Apple design. Just a functional autonomous car is enough of a wow factor these days,
particularly from a company that's not in automotive. You're not necessarily expecting Apple to come out with a
vehicle. Any new car company faces major challenges. If you went back to 2015, there was a feeling that when Apple was getting
involved that this was going to happen immediately. What a lot of people in Silicon Valley realizes that making cars is much
harder than they thought. Tesla is a rare example of how a newcomer can reimagine the slow moving and
exclusive auto industry. If you go back to 19, the 1960s when Hyundai first came on
the scene, since then, there's only been one other company that has become a mass
market carmaker, and that is Tesla. But it took Tesla 17 years before it finally turned a
sustained profit. You're not just opening the Apple Store and, you know, going walking up to
the Genius Bar and ordering your car. It's probably not going to be like that. Or maybe it could, but it's going to take a lot of changes, I'd say,
within the way we retail cars in this country. Like Tesla, a new car company would face issues with financing the
staggeringly expensive task of building an automobile manufacturing operation. Tesla has spent billions of dollars on its battery and car factories, and
it plans to build many more. But we're comparing oranges to Apple. I mean, it's Apple. It's already got the brand recognition, the capital
and the safety net, perhaps more than any other company, from any sector, from any country in the world. In its first fiscal quarter of 2021, iPhone and iPad sales pushed Apple's
revenue to over 100 billion dollars for the first time ever. And Apple's services business is doing well, too. So it's got a pretty solid fallback plan if this whole car thing doesn't
work out. One of the benefits Apple would have is that it has a lot of money and it
has a green shoot, if you will, to do this. That said, one of the disadvantages that Apple has is that it doesn't have
generations and generations of experience designing and building and selling cars. Elon Musk said that Apple might have a harder time building a car than it
did building a smartphone or a watch saying, quote, You can't just go to a supplier like Foxconn and say, build
me a car. Funny thing is Foxconn, Apple's main iPhone and iPad assembler, is now
very much involved in the automotive industry, partnering with Chinese car
manufacturer Zhejiang Geely. We're going to tend to see a lot of mergers and a lot of joint partnerships
of companies having to work together because it doesn't feel like one company can accomplish everything. The future is more than just perhaps selling the metal that's on the
wheels. It's also the value that's being created as those wheels turn, whether
that's the data that the user has or potentially that ecosystem within the car. So there's value there to unlock, and car companies are saying, well, why
are we going to give that to Apple? Why can't we do that? Autonomous driving capabilities are looking to be a
big part of the Apple car as well, a technology that is notoriously difficult
to develop, manufacturing of the cars, the distribution, that's the easy part. The hard part with self-driving, which is what they're aiming at, is
getting the A.I. technology working to the point that you can put these cars on the road
and not have them hit and kill people. And I don't think Apple's at that point right now. Alphabea---t owned Waymo says it has already logged millions of miles of
driving on public roads to fine tune its driverless cars. In 2020 alone, Waymo logged almost 629,000 miles in California, whereas Apple counted almost 19,000. And Waymo is already well on its way to launching its autonomous driving
technology, having penned deals with the likes of Jaguar. And then there's the price. Not for Apple, for us. Apple is known for its pricey products. Apple computers have consistently been pricier than PCs. The iPhone X pushed the smartphone market into a new age of over a
thousand dollar phones. What in the world would an Apple car cost? The average transaction price for a new vehicle in this country is $40,000
as of December. So people are not spending small amounts. And when you think about the technology that's going to go into
electrification and autonomous, it's going to make vehicles extremely expensive. If you look at the average selling price of the iPhone in this most
previous quarter, I believe one analyst was saying it's the highest they've ever seen it. And that is in large part because of the higher end phones, these thousand
dollar Pro models that they're selling. And so Apple has done a very good job over the years of getting the high
end of the market and then getting into the lower end of the market. The question is, what kind of car is Apple seeing the market for? Apple has been a trendsetter for decades; graphical interfaces on
computers, portable music players, smartphones, smartwatches, earbuds, so its introduction to the world of
cars could have a profound impact on the auto industry and the tech industry. There are a lot of people doing the exact same thing that Apple is. But it is very noteworthy because in terms of financial resources and
research and development, Apple has all of that in spades. One of the most interesting things about this move from Apple is the huge
amount of cash the company has. In Q1 of 2021, Apple had $195 billion on hand. You know, for $40 billion, they could probably buy Ford and come out with
the two iconic American brands partnering up for the 21st century. And it would be a home run for everybody, I bet. And don't think Ford wants to be bought by Apple. But I think for Apple it's really that idea of thinking about it
differently and almost redesigning from scratch. I don't think that they want to go with another company that's already
invested in this space. It's kind of like that radical redesign and rethinking about how you can
make a product. The rise of Silicon Valley in the car industry has made a lot of car
companies say they need to be more aggressive in kind of developing car 2.0 if you 
will. Is Apple going to be a player or are they ultimately going to decide that
they don't have the something that they want to offer that is going to be competitive? In terms of, you know, a cell phone unless it can, like, teleport a human
into where you are, it feels like there's not necessarily the possibility for, like you said, that while factor that
like jaw dropping moment, whereas in transportation, I think the opportunity is ripe for all of a sudden a massive leap forward. When Apple launched the iPhone, there were already several other companies
making smartphones. But Apple made a product that was so unique that it changed the industry
for more than a decade. If Apple can do the same thing with a car, it's probably going to succeed. The car companies are just under siege, essentially. I mean, they're fighting for their own survival. If they don't do this, they will literally become extinct. So, you know, in terms of what they do moving forward, it has to be, you
know, they really have to push the envelope. i mean at this point i just i what do i mean at this point i just i what do you want to do they only would like to you want to do they only would like to

I can! This is pretty cool technology
you got here. So, let me try that.  We’re playing footsies!  We should have done this in 
outer space! We could have both been 
sitting on, like, Neptune, in a bubble. Hey, what have you been
doing for fun? I have not left home since 
March 8. At all? I went to an eye doctor’s 
appointment because I could no longer fix
my eye infection on telemedicine. And then I went for 
a mammogram.  I asked what did you 
do for fun. Eye doctors and mammograms
do not qualify. I have never had a mammogram, 
myself Okay, so for fun. but it doesn’t sound fun.  You can do better than that. No, it is, definitely, not.
Here’s what I did for fun: I’ve had two girls here, 
the whole time, who were living in Los Angeles,  who moved here during 
the pandemic They’ve been fun. We have movie nights, just the
two girls, Stedman, and I. We do regular movie nights, and I’ve seen all the movies I 
wished I’d seen and didn’t. We watched every episode 
of “The Crown.” We started a whole thing with 
Popsicles, so we now have— That sounds fun. —twenty-three different
flavors of Popsicles, including pumpkin, 
and sweet potato. And we have Friday-night
dance nights We put puzzles together. And I’ve read a lot. 
What have you done? You know, we went— —for example—Michelle and
I went bike riding yesterday, which was fantastic, because it was a beautiful day. And game nights —big!—although sometimes,
I get too competitive. At least, that’s what 
Michelle says, because she’s been losing. Hello, President Barack Obama! Hey you! How are you? I’m so good! 
You’re in Washington, DC, and I’m home, in Santa Barbara, but—through the miracle 
of technology —we get to be face to face in
the same room, and we don’t even have 
to wear masks!  And we have a fire going, 
apparently! And we have a fire going —a real one, too! I’m excited to talk to you 
about your extraordinary —I mean, I don’t even have 
words for it, —it’s a masterful rendering of
your presidency and life, “A Promised Land.” But first, I just want to 
ask you, What was the one word that would best describe how you felt
when it was announced that Joe Biden 
and Kamala Harris will be the next President and
Vice President of the United States? I was thrilled!  "Joe Biden"! First of all, obviously, Joe is somebody who stood by me on every major decision I 
had for eight years.  He's become a brother 
-a genuinely good friend. Kamala was one of my earliest supporters when I 
first launched my presidency So, I’m personally invested
in them. And they have the character 
and experience, I think, to do an outstanding job in a very difficult time, a very challenging time, in 
this country. But, beyond the personal 
investment I have in them, I think this gives us a
chance to get back to the kind 
of competent, caring government that we 
so badly need, and that the world expects out
of the United States of America. So, it’s not going to 
immediately solve every every problem that we have —because you have enormous
challenges, around COVID and the economic after effects; you’ve got long-standing issues, like racial bias in the 
criminal justice system, and rising inequality —but without this change, I think, things would have continued
to deteriorate, and our democracy would have
been much more fragile. And I’m confident a new President 
and Vice President are gonna help us 
right the ship. welcome back to my channel I am so excited for this unboxing it's been a long time coming this video was actually going to be longer than my usual videos but I will timestamp it in the description if you would like to jump ahead [Music] so as you can tell from the title of this video this is the unboxing of the Apple watch series 5 cellular Edition I did get the aluminum 40 millimeters you can see right here I did have the Apple watch series 3 GPS version but I wanted to upgrade to the cellular and at the time that I wanted to upgrade this was coming out like a week later so I decided to wait because I was gonna get the 4 and I waited right up until the 20th to order because I wanted to see if the series 4 had dropped on the Sport Chek website so that's where I was gonna order it and it didn't it was $10 cheaper than this so I decided to go with the series 5 because why not boom look at this beautiful packaging like it looks so awesome I was gonna use the Apple watch studio to make my own watch and I was gonna pick the Clementine band but when I got it into my cart and I went to pay for it I wouldn't have got it for at least a month so I just went with the pink what is this Pink's and watch band I'm not gonna use it but it made it so I got a lot quicker I really love the way they have the actual piece set up with this sleeve it's just it's perfect it's so sleek and it's just beautiful the way the velvet or whatever it is matches the color of the piece itself [Music] [Music] I have sped this part up but if you would like to skip ahead like I said in the beginning I will leave a timestamp in the description but you know I enjoy watching it so you should too I'm kidding I ain't your mama you do what you want to do [Music] [Music] all right so now we get to unbox this pink sand sport band like I said before I don't think I'm gonna use it but you know I might change my mind at some point and want to feel a little girly though Pink's not my favorite color so let's not count on that one don't worry I've sped this part up too and before you skip ahead I just hope you've had a great day [Music] are you still watching if you are posting avocado in the comments [Music] I must admit this pink sand does look really good with this gold [Music] in case you're wondering what I'm doing here I'm telling you I'm gonna use this watch band on my new watch [Music] now the question is did I speed this part up - yes of course I did don't go skipping ahead on me you're gonna miss all the good stuff and buy good stuff I mean this sexy Apple watch I mean you gotta admit this thing is freaking sexy [Music] did you make it to the end of the unboxing in the setup I hope you did if you did make sure you post two avocados in the comments [Music] look at you you awesome human being thanks for watching but you know you can keep on watching if you want because I'm just gonna do a comparison of my series 3 with a series 5 come on that's amazing too [Music] so because this initial restart for both of them takes so freakin long I've split it up a bit and inserted a couple pictures so I'll be bopping back and forth but the clips are sped up it just takes a freaking long time but fortunately it's not like that right now it's a lot quicker I think it was just the initial boot up for both of them [Music] [Music] legit at this point I'm thinking they both crapped out on me like why the hell is is taken so freaking long [Music] are you still here I hope so you can help me out while you look at these pictures so I upgraded my Apple watch because of a weight loss journey I am currently on the cellular will benefit me a lot anyway I'm going to post a one-year video or a video when I've lost all my goal weight as a subscriber if not you should subscribe should I post it here or should I post it on my weight loss channel where you should also subscribe let me know with the eye in the sky also if you made it this far out of heart to your avocados wait what am I talking about right you skipped ahead didn't you cheese thanks that was nice of you anyway thanks for watching and talk to you all later [Music] [Music] so as you can tell from the title of this video this is the Apple watch series 5 look at you you amazing human being you made it to the box help google i o is done and so is microsoft build that means apple's worldwide developer conference is the last big software showcase for a couple months and the company is clearly planning to make a splash the keynote kicks off at 10am pacific or 1pm eastern on june 7th but if you just you just can't wait to learn about what apple is gearing up to show off this year let's take a few minutes to walk through the stuff that we know is coming and some of the things that we hope make the cut i always got a pretty substantial revamp at last year's wwdc and we're expecting it to get the lion's share of attention this year too that said many of the reports we've seen so far suggest we might be looking at an overall quieter year for iphone software for example the juiciest detail we've seen so far comes from bloomberg which reported that apple has revamped the way notifications will work in ios 15. you will apparently be able to set an iphone to deal with incoming notifications differently depending on what you're doing say driving versus sleeping or working bloomberg also suggests that ios 15 can be set to automatically respond to messages depending on which of those statuses you've set for yourself and i might be showing my age here but that almost sounds like a take on away messages from the aol instant messenger days and i am extremely ready for those to make a comeback we've also heard that apple might be gearing up to show off a new look for the iphone lock screen which would make sense if they're planning to push the concept of statuses or availability like we just talked about that also dovetails pretty nicely with rumors that the iphone 13 could embrace an android style always on display a feature that's only really possible now because apple started using oled screens and iphones last year now considering how vocal apple is about its focus on privacy i can't say i'm surprised that the company seems to be building on the app tracking transparency work that debuted in the recent ios 14.5 release for ios 15 apple has reportedly built a feature that shows users which apps are subtly collecting information about them though at this point it's not entirely clear how apple is coming to those conclusions we've also heard that apple is planning to flesh out imessage with more social features to help it compete with platforms like whatsapp but honestly who knows if that's going to be ready in time for the updates fall launch there is one thing we know for sure is coming to ios 15 though for whatever reason apple highlighted a handful of really interesting accessibility features way ahead of the show including a feature that plays soothing background sound like rain crashing waves babbling brooks and what apple calls bright and dark noise now that might not sound like a big deal and it might not be for some of you but for people like me who get distracted very easily this might be the single ios 15 feature that gets the most use since ios and ipad os share the same basic feature set you can expect just about every change we've talked about so far to apply to apple's tablets too with all of that in mind we are expecting some big new changes this year and that's mostly thanks to the new ipad pro our review along with basically every other one that's been published has called on apple to properly take advantage of the m1 chipset in the company's highest end tablets and after all this is the very same silicon found in apple's current macbook airs macbook pros and imacs there simply has to be a way for ipad os to become a little more desktop like without sacrificing the simplicity that makes the ipad as accessible as it is of course that's a whole lot easier said than done and for now all we've heard about apple's efforts on this front is that ipad os 15 will get a revamped home screen that you can fully load up with widgets remember ipad os 14 only lets you place them in the little today view sidebar that report comes courtesy of bloomberg's mark dortmund and it is about the only reasonably firm rumor we've heard about the new ipad os though we could make some justifiable leaps in logic if full screen widget support is making the jump from iphones to ipads for example we wouldn't be surprised at all if the ios app library or something like it came to ipad os 2. that means you'd finally have a place to stick all of the apps that you do legitimately need but don't want to look at all the time but that might just be wishful thinking on our part for now but let's not forget about apple's other computers last year's wwdc was a big one for max because we finally saw apple ditch intel in favor of its own surprisingly powerful chipsets since apple is still dealing with the ramifications of that ship it's very possible apple might not have many dramatic changes to announce for mac os this year then again it's also possible that apple has just gotten a lot better at keeping secrets but at this point that does seem pretty unlikely case in point a string of rumors from john prosser suggests we might get our first look at some new macbook pros running a new apple silicon chipset if his reports hold up we could be looking at a serious redesign think 14 and 16 inch models no touch bars and the reintroduction of long lost features like the magsafe charger sd card readers and a proper hdmi output that all might sound like apple is planning a return to the good old days of laptop design but let's be clear here there is no shortage of modern touches these macbook pros for instance are expected to use mini led displays like the ones we saw in this year's ipad pro and if you missed our review just know that it looks excellent we should also note that these macbooks will reportedly use apple's next generation high performance chipset allegedly called the m1x moving from apple's biggest screens to its smallest well look we don't really know a whole lot about what's going into the new version of watchos apart from what the company has already confirmed for example the next watch os update watch os 8 will include a new feature called assistivetouch that will allow people to control their apple watches just by clenching their fists and making pinching motions with their fingertips as a concept that's pretty wild but maybe not quite as wild as how the company actually pulled it off the watch will use its motion sensors its heart rate monitor and a dash of machine learning to detect minute motions in your muscles if the name wasn't already a giveaway assistive touch is part of apple's push for greater accessibility for its hardware and this could be a very very big deal for people who only have the use of one hand but i wouldn't be surprised to see more traditionally able people trying it out too i certainly will the rest of the watch awaits story remains a mystery and the same is true of a lot of stuff about wwdc but at the very least we don't have to wait very long to get some answers if you have any predictions or any feedback about our predictions let us know down in the comments and if you don't we'll see you next week after the show to see how right or wrong we were about all of this [Music] you this video is sponsored by muse a unique spatial canvas that's your tool for thought hey it's chris this isn't another video that's going to tell you about apps you already know about like notion notability pixelmator or bear this is a video where i'm going to share some ipad apps that should be basically brand new to most people that own an ipad and of course i'll make sure to link these all up down in the description but don't forget you have a pause button and you can use it if you feel like i'm going too fast but just to make sure that everybody's as caught up as possible let me just briefly recap a few of my favorites from previous episodes mind node is still my favorite mind mapping app for ipad mac iphone and yep even the apple watch numerix is an app that lets you design gorgeous custom dashboards in minutes to beautifully display all the data that matters most to you and both of those apps came from the first episode in this series back in 2019 which now has over a million views previously i also shared an app called ferrite pro which is my favorite podcast and audio editing app for the ipad which is from another episode in this series that has over 2 million views i don't know it's gonna be a tall order to try to outdo the views in this episode but i'm giving it my best effort and then there's endless paper the infinite canvas app that literally lets you keep writing and sketching in any direction for infinity and task heat the app that marries a flow chart with a to-do list both of which came from the third episode in this series now i'm gonna link these episodes up in the description so when you're done watching this one you can go back if you're new here and catch up also if this sounds interesting so far and if you like ipad stuff get yourself subscribed because i don't want you to miss out on all the cool ipad accessories that i unbox and review here but also you got to be prepared for the frequent andy mineo and nitro coffee mentions which happen a lot too and just like adding a paper-like screen protector to your ipad really changes up the whole experience for the better today i want to introduce you to a handful of extra useful apps but as a bonus before we even get to those heavy hitter apps here's just a quick rapid fire list of a few interesting apps that i bet you've never heard of before that will just kind of be like an appetizer before the main course if you'd like to use your ipad alongside your mac you might like to have the not boring apps bundle on deck for a timer a calculator or a weather experience that looks like candy tastes scan thing is an app that will literally let you scan anything and it will give you a perfect cutout that can be pasted anywhere you can trace it or you can use it in a million different creative ways now if you wish you actually knew how to draw so you could put your apple pencil to good use then check out shadow draw and check this out what if you can send messages to your future self from your present self if you're intrigued by that concept then check out time caps it's kind of like a future diary and if you edit video on your ipad you might hate that your favorite video editing app doesn't have built-in stabilization well emulsion to the rescue you can now stabilize footage on your ipad ipad os of course now has widget support which is great but if you need more than the built-in widgets then you can create your own using flex widgets which will let you design widgets your way and the last of the appetizers but certainly not the least if you need some help hitting your goals then check out thrive it's an app that can actually help you get your life together all right are you getting some value out of this video yet i know you are but now it's time to get into the stuff that you came here for the paradigm shifters but before we do let me take one second here to just thank muse the sponsor that has made this video possible in the first place muse is such a great fit for this video definitely an app that makes the ipad worth owning muse is a spatial canvas for your research notes your reading your sketching your screenshots your bookmarks if you're doing some deep thinking at your ipad and if you don't want to be constrained to linear documents of mostly text and if you want to move stuff around and bring new ideas in and easily cull irrelevant material and maybe even get a little messy in the process then muse is definitely the app for you now before muse was even a sponsor i had already featured them in another video because i just love the features like being able to add anything to a muse board from photos to tweets to files and more and i also really love how sketching isn't restricted to a dedicated space so i can write right on top of things without any restrictions or boundaries i think you owe it to yourself to consider trying muse out alright you probably heard me say over and over again that the magic keyboard is my favorite ipad typing experience of all time because it is but the hardware that is only part of the equation you also have to pair it with some really great software to complete the experience and that's why i think you should check out spaces a new minimal writing app that really stands out from the crowd as you can hopefully notice there's absolutely zero clutter when it comes to this interface and if you look closely you'll realize there's no toolbar anywhere to be found instead it uses markdown to do things like make text bold or italic so i can put an asterisk on each side of a word and it will turn italic most markup applications leave those symbols there and just kind of clutters everything up but this gives you a truly minimalist writing interface but one thing that i really like is that you can mark a note as unread then you know oh there's something there that i need to revisit now there's a lot of so-called minimalist writing apps out there to choose from but i've never seen one that so thoroughly cuts down the interface while also thoughtfully leaving you with the functionality that you need and want it's really a magic combo i would say for your magic keyboard now the ipad has a touch interface and macs don't at least not yet so in my mind it makes sense to use a task manager that takes full advantage of the ipad's touch interface something like magnetic magnetic is a list manager whose super powers lie in hotkeys and gestures so watch this area of the screen this is where the magnet resides true to the name if you tap on items they get pulled down to the magnet down here where you can then easily manage them in bulk which is so much faster than having to individually mark items as done or individually delete items or individually move items to other lists or individually schedule items magnetic is such a beautiful app and it really shines here on the ipad or maybe it's the other way around maybe the ipad shines because of magnetic now whereas spaces the app i mentioned earlier was primarily a writing first app hypernodes is a note-taking app but it's mind-bendingly different and more useful it's just on a whole different level that's because it's very similar to rome research which you might have heard of or obsidian except that it has this beautiful native app here so you don't have to use the web interface now instead of having a traditional file or folder structure you instead just write out your thoughts and then reference different pages and blocks so in hypernotes everything is connected using these bi-directional links so you can see those showing up here with these hashtags and if i tap on this one that says pages it takes me to pages if i tap on this one that's hashtag blocks i'll go to blocks which is a different page so if i look on the left here i see pages table and graph if i tap on graph i'll actually get this really interesting knowledge graph of everything that i've stuck into the app and i'll be able to see the relationships of everything that's linking to each other there's just so many ways that you can dissect your information and you'll end up seeing some patterns and connections that you just normally wouldn't and if that sounds complicated i promise it really isn't if you spend 60 seconds within the app and check out the tutorial you'll get it in a snap now an incredibly huge part of owning and using an ipad remains web browsing and for most people out there that still means using safari so we visit websites and we take in all this information sometimes we try to save those websites we bookmark them everybody has a different method right some people use the built-in bookmarks some people have a list and they copy and paste urls into that there's dedicated bookmarking apps but whatever the method is that you have been using there's a great chance that most of the websites you want to remember you never even go back and revisit you forget they even existed and that is where the app called dewmarks comes into play it describes itself as the to do app for bookmarks now subscribers already know that i absolutely love i mean love an app called my mind which is where i store all the stuff that i come across that i find that i want to remember and re-access at some point whether it's a product or a website or an article or a tweet or a picture it all goes into my mind unfortunately there's no native app the only problem is i end up saving a bunch of stuff in there and then forgetting about it even though my mind has such an amazing powerful incredible search function like i've never seen any other app even have you can type blue and all the things with blue in the photos will show up you can type tweets and every tweet that you have will show up it's really cool it's just i don't go searching for stuff all that often saved but not searched do marks though will let you save urls or websites as to-do's which essentially just makes your bookmarks actionable it's a really unique and useful approach and the icing on the cake here for ipad users is that you can come in and actually just drag and drop websites right into your domarks app and then they're labeled for you and you can come in and you can do things like add a category or an action so i can come in and say read watch listen buy eat or drink or do so here's one i made for uncrate if i click on it it will open i can actually browse around and do whatever it is that i wanted to do come back into the app and check it off and it's done and it disappears i can go back and see recently completed or even deleted so it's not like i lose that website but isn't this just a cool way to actually work through the stuff that you wanted to remember the websites i think so now i mentioned an app earlier called flex widgets which basically lets you design the look of a new widget but compared to an app like charty flex widgets kinda ends up looking like child's play that's because charity lets you create charts directly from shortcuts and stick those charts in your ipad's widgets what does that do it lets you create some really cool data driven widgets several different kinds that you can choose from they're just waiting for you to populate with your data i can do my heart rate today or my weekly energy weekly steps there's a bar chart or a pie chart that i can just use for whatever i can look at my weight at a weight chart i can compare distances or maybe do some moving averages or stacked monthly expenses if you have a treasure trove of data which if you have an apple watch you definitely do or maybe you've got a spreadsheet that you've just packed full of interesting personal information and data this will let you display it on your ipad's home screen this is the last app we're going to talk about today looks kind of like a blank screen doesn't it well you're not too far off it's called danger notes and basically what it is is an app that's for you procrastinators out there or for anybody who's just suffering from writer's block whether it's an email or a speech or a term paper that you have to get started on and get into the flow of and get done but you just don't know where to start or maybe you don't want to start this is the app that's going to give you the boost or the kick in the pants that you need to actually get something down let's pretend i'm writing a book here chris's amazing adventures as an apple reviewer if i stop typing it's going to erase everything that i've typed already which i definitely don't want i wonder what i should talk about next here uh i don't know oh no fail it's erased everything that i wrote which was already a masterpiece clearly so if you had i don't know 2 000 words written or a thousand words 500 words and they're perfectly crafted words you would be pretty motivated to not let this happen to you you don't want to see the red fail screen now what you can do is come up here and set a timer so it kind of defaults to five minutes you could have it be one minute or 20 minutes whatever block you want to really make yourself stick to and get some writing done but that's it that's the app i mean sometimes you just don't feel like doing something or you don't know where to start and oftentimes the advice is just right and then once you have something at least down at least out of your head you can edit it later but it's that getting it out part that's a little bit tricky sometimes i already really like this app we're gonna be good friends wow that's it for this episode i don't know if this is episode three or four or whatever it is this is a yearly thing that i'm gonna do so it's been going for a few years if you want to catch next year's make sure you're subscribed and seriously if you're new around here i've got a ton of ipad content it's just going to take your ipad ownership to the next level i'll link up some of the best down below or you can just search daily tech daily tekk ipad or ipad pro ipad air whatever it is check out the review the unboxing or the tips the apps there's a lot to choose from thanks for watching today i'll catch you guys in the next one later [Music] [Music] no [Music] [Music] [Music] now um [Music] [Music] oh [Music] so you Apple has a plan and a promise
to make Apple carbon neutral. Wait, no.
We've already done that. To make every single Apple
product carbon neutral by 2030, even yours. We're working to make every
iPhone, iPad, Watch, and Mac with 100 percent recycled
or renewable materials. We're finding new ways
to extract aluminum, steel, tin,
tungsten, and plastic from recycled Apple products. We're growing enough trees
and recycling enough paper to sustain all our packaging,
but we can do much more. It's not just what goes
into our products, it's also how they're made. Hundreds of manufacturers,
distributors, testers, assemblers, dis-assembles,
and material-makers all upgrading to 100 percent
renewable energy. A lot of them are even going
zero-waste, but it's still not enough. Manufacturing is just
a part of it. What about all of you?
This is a big one. Apple devices are all over
the world, and by 2030, all of the electricity
charging all of your devices will be 100 percent renewable. So you're a part of this, too, because Apple is going
carbon neutral. No, everything Apple

has become indispensable. And at the heart of iPhone
is iOS. iOS powers the experiences
we've come to rely on. This year,
we were inspired to create even more meaningful ways
iPhone could help you. Our new release is iOS 15. It's packed with features
that make the iOS experience adapt to and complement
the way you use iPhone, whether it's staying connected with those
who matter to you most, finding the space
to focus without distraction, using intelligence to discover
the information you need, or exploring
the world around you. Let's start off with features
that will let you stay connected
in brand-new ways. In a year when figuring out
how to get face-to-face has felt more essential
than ever, we've all found ourselves
using video calling for just about everything, and when it comes
to making calls that are easy, spontaneous, and connect us
with the people who matter most, FaceTime is a standout. With its incredibly
intuitive design and end-to-end encryption
since day one, FaceTime is how we catch up
with friend around the world and how we stay close to family
members when we're apart. Enjoying these deeply personal
moments over video can bring so much joy, but it also has its challenges. When talking in person,
our brains process hundreds of social, auditory
and visual cues. When talking on a video call, many of those signals
can get lost, leaving us feeling drained. So this year, we've set out
to make FaceTime calls feel more natural,
comfortable, and lifelike. First is a feature
that makes FaceTime calls sound like you're sitting
in the very same room. We're bringing spatial audio
to FaceTime, creating a sound field
that helps conversations flow as easily as they do
face-to-face. Now your friends' voices
are spread out to sound like they're coming
from the direction in which they're positioned
on the video call, making your calls more
comfortable and more natural. Next, let's talk about
two powerful new options for your microphone. The first is voice isolation. When you're on a FaceTime call, your mic is picking up
a cacophony of sound, so in voice isolation, machine learning
distinguishes those sounds, blocks out the ambient noise,
and prioritizes your voice so that it comes through
crystal clear. Check it out. [person]
I wish I could be there! [person] Me too! Let me fix this. Better, right? [person] Yeah. [person] Got what she wanted
for her birthday. [Craig] Sometimes, though, we want every bit of sound
to come through, and that's when you switch
to wide spectrum. In wide spectrum,
your mic picks up an entire symphony's worth
of sound: your voice
and everything around you. Next, let's turn to video. When you want to see
every face in the room, you can now turn on grid view, giving you another way to view
your group FaceTime calls. Here, you see people
in the same size tiles, and you'll be able to clearly
identify who's speaking while seeing
everyone else's reactions. And to make your FaceTime
video capture more beautiful than ever,
we're introducing portrait mode, where we've taken inspiration from iPhone's
stunning portrait photos. In FaceTime, portrait mode
blurs the background and naturally
puts the focus on you. Next, to help you schedule
your FaceTime calls, we've created FaceTime links. Now you can generate a link
for a FaceTime call and share it anywhere. It's a terrific way
to plan ahead for a call. You can send the FaceTime link
in places like Messages, email, WhatsApp,
or jump into Calendar and make an event
for your FaceTime call so everyone will know exactly
where to meet and when. And it's not just Apple devices that can use a FaceTime link
to join your call. Your friends with Android
and Windows devices can use your FaceTime link
to join the call right from their browser,
and even on the web, FaceTime calls are still
end-to-end encrypted, so your privacy
is never compromised. Some of our favorite ways
to connect involve more than just talking, like getting together
for a weekly movie night or listening to an album
with a friend that brings back
amazing memories. We love enjoying
shared experiences, and so we built SharePlay. SharePlay is a powerful
new set of features for shared experiences that you can enjoy
when you're on a FaceTime call. With SharePlay, you can
bring music into your call for a shared listening
experience unlike any other, watch movies and TV shows while having rich, real-time
connection with your friends. And share your screen, giving you
limitless possibilities for bringing apps
right into your FaceTime calls. Let me show you how this works, starting with
listening together. Say you're hanging out
on a FaceTime, talking about a new album
that came out over the weekend. With SharePlay, you could bring that album
right into the conversation. When you're on a call,
all you need to do is press play in Apple Music, and you can choose
to listen together. And like magic,
high quality music playback will start in sync
for everyone on the call, and you're still connected
with FaceTime while listening. Everyone on the call
can add songs to a shared queue, and shared playback controls
let anyone press play, pause, or jump to the next track. Now let's check out what
it's like to watch together. When you're on
a FaceTime call, jump to streaming app
and press play. and boom, you and your friends
are watching the same video totally in sync. SharePlay is unlike
any other shared content experience
out there because it moves fluidly
throughout the whole system. Maybe you want to order takeout
while you watch. Picture in Picture
lets you see your friends and the video
you're enjoying together, and controls
are always accessible with just a tap. And if the group wants
to stay connected with no interruptions
to the video's sound, you can jump into Messages and keep the conversation
going there. And when the moment calls
for a bigger screen, you can extend the video
to your Apple TV and watch it there
while sharing the moment with your friends over FaceTime
on your iPhone. Even when you're using SharePlay
across multiple devices, everyone will remain in sync. We wanted to make sure
you have a ton of incredible experiences
to share in FaceTime, so in addition to Apple Music
and the TV app, SharePlay is designed
to work with your other favorite apps
and streaming services. With an API
built for easy adoption, developers can bring their own
apps right into FaceTime. And today,
we're so pleased to announce that we're already working
with some incredible partners. Watch blockbuster movies
with your friends on Disney+, and hit TV shows on Hulu. Catch originals from HBO Max. And see your friends react live
to a buzzer-beater in the NBA app. Or a speed run on Twitch. Jump on TikTok to watch
the funniest videos of the week, learn a new skill with a friend
on MasterClass, and so much more. Finally, check out
screen sharing. You can use it
to browse Zillow listings live with your future roommates or show off a tricky move
in your favorite game. Screen sharing
is also a simple and super effective way
to help someone out and answer questions
right in the moment. And it works across
Apple devices. So that's SharePlay,
a whole new way in FaceTime to connect and share experiences
with the people you love. Next, when it comes to staying
connected throughout the day, our go-to is Messages, and these days,
so many of our conversations are inspired through sharing
articles, photos, and more. So this year,
we're introducing great new ways to enjoy all of this amazing
shared content and the exchanges that follow. if apple made a restaurant is here make sure you hit the video with a like subscribe to my channel if you haven't already leave a comment let me know what your favorite part of the video was and turn those notifications on if you haven't already if we get 300 000 likes i'm gonna drop my next video early and at 500 000 i'll be responding to every comment

have lost the ability to see. Some say
sight was taken from them by God... to heal the Earth. For the few who remain,
vision is only a myth. But after so many years,
the power of sight has returned. What is it? Something's different. The children. They have the ability to see. My children... they have the power
that we would call magical or evil. We must protect them. For centuries,
we feared this day would come. The evil of light
once almost destroyed the world. And now it has returned. Find the children who can see... and bring them to me. Now they will come for us. If we give the babies,
they might leave us alone. -No.
-I stand with Baba Voss! These children are a gift. They will bring knowledge
that will begin a new world. We are family.
We are one and we fight as one. I have to keep you safe. The moment has come. It's astonishing how the smallest moment

grab something real quick. All right guys, we're
still doing the video. We got all the pool stuff. We got this. " Hey dad, we had to get school supplies. Get the hot tub and towels
ready, well be right back. Love you." Did Adley write this? (camera squeaking) - All right. Well, let's go get the hot tub ready and they'll be right back I bet. So I'm thinking we blow all these up and we make like a crazy obstacle course that we have to like swim through and find prizes and (yelps)
it's cold, it's raining. Cold, cold, cold, cold. Hey let's open this. (tub steams) That steam coming out. Hope Adley and mom don't take too long. All right, is that probably enough? That's probably enough. Let's go put this stuff over here. - Who are you? (mix tape scratches) - Huh?! Who are you?! Who are you?! - Who are you? - No, who are you? - I'm a mermaid. - You're a mermaid?! - Mm hmm. - A real mermaid? - Yes. - Are you nice? - Yeah. - What are you doing in my hot tub? - I went to the sewers and then I just got trapped in here. Can you help me get out? Its really hot. - Well yeah, it's a hot tub. Wait, you were swimming in the
sewers and you got lost here, are you a real mermaid? - Yeah. - Let me see. Can I touch your fin? - Whoa! It's real! What?! What's your name? - Melody. - Melody? - I'm just a little kid. - You're a little kid mermaid? You're lost? - Mm hmm. - Okay. I'm going to help you. What do I need to do? How did you get out of here? Where did you come from? Is this the drain? (pops) - The sewers, remember? - But where did you come through? Like, how did you end up in the hot tub? - I came from underwater. - Where did you like come
out of though? Do you know? - The wall! - The wall? Did you come through like one of these? - No. I don't where I come from. I
don't know how to get back. - Well, maybe did you try like one of those holes over there? - No I don't fit. - You don't fit? I'll help you get out. Come here, come here, come here. Maybe I could like put you
in our bathtub or something. All right. I have a daughter named Adley and I think she'll know
exactly what to do. - Can I eat first? - I don't know what to do? I've never had a mermaid before! Am I going crazy? This is my house, you can come in here. (door slams) Mom and Adley, we've got a situation. Are you home? Mom's my wife, Adley's my daughter. Here, let's, you're so slippery. Okay, let's lay these towels down for ya. - Is there a sea bed anywhere here? I don't have any sea beds but maybe I can find some food for ya? Here. (Dad grunts) Like that and then do you want to be like covered up at all or? - No. - No? Okay. What do you need? - Some food, please. - Food, okay, food. Okay, I'll be right back. - Make sure it's mermaid food! - Here's some delicious
what we call Doritos. I think you'll like 'em. (chips crunch) - These are delicious. What kind of seaweed is this called? - Here's some water. Well, it's not really seaweed. It's kinda just like
Doritos, like human food but they're really yummy. - I can't eat human food! I'll turn into a real human! - Wait seriously? - Yeah. - How many did you eat? - Five. - Okay. I'm gonna get
the stuff away from you hopefully you're okay. - What?! ( Melody yells) - [Dad] Melody?! (thunder rumbles) - [Dad] Melody! Are you okay? - Yes. - What happened? - Did you eat too much human food? - Yep. And I'm okay. - Oh okay. (Melody screams) What? (Dad yells) You have toes. Cute toes. Oh look, they're like painted all mermaid. - And! - Ah! Legs! What do we do?! - I don't know? (gasps) My daughter, Adley, she has clothes that would probably fit you. Should we go get some Adley's clothes? - Yeah. - Do you know how to walk? - Whoa! (Melody thuds) Okay, so you got to stand up and balance and then put like one leg forward and then like put the other leg forward. - How bout you just carry me? - You got to learn to
walk if you have legs. - Just carry me or I won't learn to walk. - Okay. - Cause I really can't get up. - Okay, whoa! Whoa! Okay, let's go get you
dressed in Adley's clothes. I'm sure she has
something that'll fit you. There you go, Melody. How does that feel? - Good but, - Is it comfy? - Yeah but who's clothes are these? Oh, these are my daughter's clothes. So I have a daughter and her name's Adley and she's five years old. - I'm five years old! In mermaid years. - You're five? - Mm hmm. - So you guys would be friends. - Mm hmm. - She's going to be home soon. I don't really know where she's at. We're going to film a video and then all of a sudden
she just ran a way. - Can we learn how to walk? - Oh, you want to learn how to walk? (Melody thuds) - Melody be careful. - Yes. - Okay. So here's what you're going to- (Melody thuds) Okay. So here's what you're gonna, (Melody grunts) Okay, so, here's what you gotta do. So this foot, and then you go this foot. And then you go this foot,
and then you go this foot. - Okay, I think I got it now. - Okay. (Melody thuds) Okay. Let's try this again. Okay. All right. So you gotta go this
foot and then this foot and then you gotta balance so up here like keep your arms out so you can balance and then this foot, and then this foot. Does that makes sense? - Yeah. - You got this! Yeah! Look at that! You're doing awesome! Oh careful! Slow down! Slow down! (Melody thuds) (Dad sighs) Sorry, melody. (Dad gasps) I got an idea. Okay. Stand up. I got just the thing,
they're called shoes. You've probably never worn them
before but they're amazing. Put on these shoes and see if that helps. And then I'm also going to get you - It is easier to walk with shoes. - What?! No! That's not how you use shoes! No! Melody those aren't, okay, bad idea. I just need to teach you
how to be a human, huh? These are fingers, they move. These are toes, they wiggle. Wiggle your toes. You got to learn to wiggle. Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle. - Wiggle wiggle, wiggle - Wiggle 'em! (Melody giggles) Can you not wiggle your toes? Melody! Maybe a walker! A walker would help. Do you know what a walker is? Okay. I mean to get you one. Stay right there. (shoes slamming) - Okay, I fell like this
is an easier way to swim in water but it might
be easier if you just, hey, a bed! I've been wanting to take a nap. - [Dad] Okay, here's the walker, whoa! Melody stop! No! No! No! That's not a mermaid
bed, that's a dog bed. (exhales) You have so much to learn. Okay look. This is Nico toy. - What's a Nico? - A Nico he's Adley's brother. Do you have brothers? - No. - Well, this is Adley's brother and he used to play with
it when he was a baby but you can hold on right here and I can help you walk, whoa! Okay. Hold on. Stand up straight and then hold this and then yeah, walk with your feet. Good job. Good job, Melody. All right. It's going to take a
little bit of practice. Practice with that I'm
going to get you a new one. Just be careful, okay? Okay, good job Melody. - I always needed a thing
to help brush my hair. (Melody humming) - What are you doing with our fork?! That's a fork?! - That's for my hair. - No that's a (grunts) - No, it's a dingle hopper. It's a dingle hopper! - It's a fork. - It's a dingle hopper! - What's a dingle hopper? - It's something you brush your hair with. - You're crazy, girl. Okay. Hand me the dingle hopper. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Hand me the dingle hopper. Brushed your hair? Oh, It does feel kind of good. - Hey that's mine! Okay, okay! It's not a dingle hopper. It's a fork. Okay. Oh! All right, we gotta get these legs, ow! Sorry, I stepped on your toe. - Ow! - Is it okay? - Yeah. - Okay. No Melody, where are you going? - It's a land shark. I always wanted to see a shark. - That's just the Valentine's day box. - No it's not! It's a real shark! A real shark. It's just a- Okay. Aw man. Let me, let's call mom and Adley and see if they're almost home. Just let me get my phone. Don't get in any trouble. You sit right there. Where's my phone? (Melody screams) - [Dad] What?! - It's a mean one! (Dad grunts) Okay. I can't leave you
alone for one second. Okay, I'm going to put you
in the safest place I know where you can't get hurt. Right here. (Melody thuds) Cover you in pillows. So you can't get hurt no
matter what you do, don't move. Just stay around all
these soft pillows, okay? - Okay. (Melody pants) This is so tiring. Wish I can get out. (Melody gasps) What's that's? What's that?
What's that? What's that?! I wanna know, I wanna know. I wish I (Melody grunts) Let me out. - Hold on. We're going to call Adley and mom. - Who's Adley and mom? - Adley's my daughter, she's
five just like you remember? And mom is well, she's my wife. We're married and we have
kids and this is our house. And I guess it's kind of like
where you live in the ocean. Hello? Where do you live in the ocean? - I live in the deep sea. - Oh, well this is like my deep sea and let's call mom. - What kind of shell phone is that? - Shell phone? It's a cell phone not a shell. - It's a shell phone. - It's a magic phone. Look, It can call people, watch. She didn't answer. What could she be doing
that is so busy right now? Come on. - There's a mirror inside that shell? - Well kind of like, so that's us. And then this shell phone can
talk to Jenny's shell phone and then we can talk
and that's how it works. - I don't think your
shell phone is working? - Yeah, they're not answering. Why could they be so busy right now? We're about to film a
video. I don't get it. - I got an idea! - You have an idea? - Let's go. - Let's do it. - Oh my god. - Oh, I forgot you can't walk. Okay. Let's just, how
about (grunts) you just sit on my shoulders for all of this, okay. - Okay. - What's your idea? - Do you know where pirate island is? - Pirate Island? I do! I do know where it's that way. We have a ship there. - Pirate island is close to my house! - Really? So if we put you in the
water at pirate Island, you could find a way home? - Mm hmm. - Let's go to pirate Island, then. Come on. Whoa! Hold on! Have you ever driven in a car before? - No! - Well, this is going to be interesting. (door slams) All right. - This is really cold than the water. - I know it's winter time and
out of the water right now. - What is this white stuff on me? - It's called snow. I don't think you're going to like it. Let's just get you back into the water. - I'm so cold. - Yeah. All right. So what do I do? Do I just have to throw
you back in the water? - No! - No? - I'll drown! - Oh, well what do we gotta do then? - I need my mermaid tail. - Oh, yeah, you don't have a mermaid tail. You have these cute little toes. Your toes are so cute. Wait, how do we get your mermaid tail? - Seaweed! - Yeah, you ate human food
and turned into human. We need to find seaweed. Maybe there's some over here. Where did we get seaweed? - In the water, duh! - Oh yeah the water, okay let's go. Sand, sand, sand. All right seaweed? Oh, some seaweed right here, okay. (Dad grunts) Here eat this. - Mm mm that's good. - You ate it all? - Mm! (Dad yells) (magical sparkling sound) You're changing! Whoa! Whoa! (thunder zaps) (Dad panting) Melody?! - Yay! - You're a mermaid! We did it! How do you feel? - Good. - Good, Okay. Now what? - Just throw me in the water. - Throw you in the water? Okay, one more hug. Thanks, that was so much fun. Any last words? - Tell Adley I'll visit
her in pirate island. - Okay. I'll let her know. One, two, three! Whoa! (water splashes) (Dad gasps) She did it! We saved her life. Melody, I'm going to miss you. See you this summer on pirate Island. Adley and mom are not going to believe me. This was the craziest Adley video. I guess this is the end now? What a weird video. Thanks for watching, bye.

recover it but more importantly also compared to tile zone tracking service which is something that i've been using for many years so i got this crazy idea inspired by mr beast videos where i would give somebody a thousand dollars for every hour they could avoid getting caught i know that sounds pretty crazy and also very expensive so i reached out to the folks over at b h photo i pitched them the idea they loved it so big thanks to them for sponsoring today's video but more importantly i wanted this to feel as real as possible so i asked around if anybody knew somebody that was deserving of this competition and without any briefing this is what happened so do you know why you're here no i do not know why i'm here okay so in this case is an apple air tag and also a tile card tracking devices really okay here's what i'm gonna do if you can keep this case away from me for every 30 minutes that you keep it away i'm going to give you 500 okay now i'm going to give you a five minute head start so you better hurry up okay let's go set five minute timer all right so here we are five minutes you guys can see it is 3 37 okay 3 37 five minute head start so i feel there's a lot of videos on how to use it this is more of a real world test like i'm gonna pretend that i was at the park and somebody took my case my bag my camera bag i'm at the bathroom i come back and it's gone typically i mean it's gonna take me five minutes but we're giving them a five minute head start and then we're gonna be able to track them so should be a lot of fun now i honestly didn't know how much knowledge lavon knew about apple's air tags or even tile's own tracker now you gotta assume if somebody were to take your bag they either know or they don't know what's inside and if they're being tracked so i'm entirely not familiar with this area so we're going to try to have some fun and find us a good place to hide this thing if i was them yeah yeah i would hide over here by these mountains i did see them go this way though in their car yeah so they went that way so at least we kind of know but let's see oh 10 seconds nine eight well right now what i'm looking for is in a gate opening or just somewhere where i could just stash this out in the field but from what i'm seeing here there's a lot of gates so we're going to keep looking around and find us an entryway which i think this might be it here what's weird is that it's saying that the backpack is still here at this park so i'm guessing that maybe they turn their phones off maybe let's see what tile is doing okay so tile nothing i just marked it as lost and it's going to notify me when it finds it so i think right now we should just go man oh wait wait wait wait oh it's oh there there it goes it's pinging it but it's just saying like it's around the corner let's go let's go all right found us a dirt road so i think maybe a good place to put this is somewhere near one of these antennas possibly that may knock out the frequency so i could maybe trick mondo those people that don't know lavon he's actually a runner he runs there's no way i could catch up to him i mean there's just no way but i can run him over okay it's saying that he's up here they went up the hills dude they're they're up here supposedly he's up here but oh no it's still saying he's up here this is a non non through street he's trapped he is trapped ah this is fun that's him that's him smile you will not find me i'm using my phone chasing him oh man oh my god where are you going i'm not going over there there's the team over there i gotta win that 500 i'm gonna catch you dude hey bro no trespassing [Music] i'll do anything for the 500 oh okay let's go back you you stay with him i told you he was fast it doesn't matter he left this car over here he needs to get his get back into his car there's no way he's going to leave it here he's over there he's actually trespassing not that he cares he wants some money that was a very fun little trip there shoelaces and tied i fell through a couple bushes but we still got the case the thing is now we have a tractor over here and my car is parked over there i left my keys and my phone now we're on foot we've got to find a place to hide so i kind of bend the rules here a little bit lavon ended up leaving his phone and his keys inside the car and i just didn't want to leave it unattended and at the same time i didn't want to take his keys and his card so i ended up calling nelson which is the cameraman that was following him and i told them that we would go pick them up grant them immunity bring them back to their car and then give them a two-minute head start all right your two minutes starts now set two minute timer keep moving come on some people don't know that if your iphone or if there's an iphone that isn't connected that see their iphone is on we'll be able to track them easily but that's the thing some people do and don't know that so uh we won't tell them that which makes it a little bit more exciting now but they're gone they are gone give us a two minute head start so the idea is we're gonna go find us a mall and once we find that mall we're gonna change clothes and we're gonna hide now what did tyle do let's check tile because we never really checked tile to see what it was telling me i did say to notify me when i was oh no there was nearby but still like most recent location still saying dog park so i think for now we could say apple one point tile zero right round one round two all right i'm already out a thousand dollars so round two begins all right so we got us the location we are about 12 minutes away we're gonna go to the nearest mall and uh change clothes get incognito get this sweat off my face and then we should be good this two-minute head start should be good but with him with that model y it got a little bit speed on it this car is a little bit slow so time is up stop the timer let's see where they're at it's saying it's 300 feet two minutes away oh there it goes i know he's not driving a fast car you know what he could have turned this into a foot game he i think they probably just parked and he just bucked it and they're just gonna run yeah dude it's saying that he's up here there's no way that he came back okay so supposedly he's right here here it is we've arrived let's let's pull in here maybe the car is here and he just ran okay let me ping new location hold on it's updating that was six minutes ago so this was the location six minutes ago so now you're on the freeway we are heading down to the mall right now we're gonna have us some fun we're gonna get us over there we're gonna get on foot and just run around and give ourselves some time to hide and i don't think you'll be able to find us through here oh backpack just updated you look oh they're on the freeway oh man they're far now okay it's where they're eight minutes away dude look eight minutes away i hope he runs out of gas i hope i i hope he has to stop at a gas station dude because imagine getting him at a gas station that would be clutch yeah wall pumping so now we're just going to find us a parking spot we're going to get ourselves changed and we are going to hide ourselves in this mall in here luckily to you we got us some chargers here so hopefully we are incognito okay so we have to go on the freeway and it looks like from the location it looks like it's a parking lot dude 4th street they're going to ontario mills all right so now we're here at the location go ahead and grab a charge we're gonna get a change of clothes and uh we're gonna go ahead and give herself a hide a t-shirt and some different shoes this year he will not be able to spot me with just this apparel so let's jump into that and let us hide so backpack location has not moved they're at the mall it's a parking lot all right so now we got the case we're out of location now let's go ahead and hide so i checked on tile to see what the status was on the tracker and it was still saying that it was at the dog park even though technically i gave him a ride back to his car and he was with me for about two minutes so i don't understand why i kind of just gave up on it and i was only using the find my app on the iphone to locate the lost air tag i don't think he realizes the pinpoint accuracy that this thing has he's right here he's right here he's right here it's got to be it's showing it's right here dude i don't see his car dude it's showing that it's right here let's hope he hasn't seen me and i'm going to park over here in the charging station he won't find us in here it's inside it's inside they're inside you guys okay let's see if you guys are allowed this is actually a lot more complicated because it's not telling me exactly where he's at he's just saying that it's inside the mall this mall is huge lenscrafters lenscrafters let's go new location dude it's saying he's over here we're in here and it's saying he's over here so the mall was a bad idea we got kicked out by security but as i seen mondo did park next to me so he's probably inside looking for me so we got us a another head start to find us a new location oh oh it just updated he's gone dude he's across the street we gotta go all right so we are here at the stoplight we're going to target i'm kind of parched i'm looking to get something to drink maybe a snack probably just walk around trying to be as much as incognito as possible and i don't think uh i don't see mondo in my mirror so i think we're in the clear [Music] you think they saw us [Music] see if you see him saying that it's right here he's right here at this gas station it's so funny a tesla at a gas station hold on oh it moved we are officially here and uh i think nectar might be a good place to start off get us some juices dude they're at another parking lot it's saying they're in yogurtland oh there he goes okay i know nelson he always has to pee he always has to pee okay take a left here they're in here dude they're near all right so we are getting our food with me getting that food the next thing that we're gonna do is gonna walk around here find us a place to just chill for a bit keep a good eye to see if we can find mondo we got us a good head start from the mall but i'm just hoping that he won't find us here wait do you see him anywhere he should be right here is that wait oh yeah is that that is that is that's his car that's his car dude that's his car yeah yeah go go go go go go go go go yeah that's his car dude that's the ford right yes isn't it yeah that's his car right this car for sure okay one thing i keep seeing there's so many white cars that keep passing by and i keep thinking is that him is that him still waiting for this bowl and no longer is taking it's this got me sweating for sure hold on i'm using the armando's searching signal try moving to a different location let's go let's go there he is there he is dude yeah that's him wait is it is that him we'll be right back uh can i leave it here by chance yeah thank you hold on that's his car for sure that that is his car right they're watching us look there right there i just saw nothing i just saw where where there he is okay so i cut this part out because it was just too jarring as you can see and honestly i was able to catch up to him a few seconds later not because i was faster but because i had something in the case that wore him down one thing that he doesn't know there's a sandbag in there that's why it's hairy i put a sandbag in there no i was like when i made that turn so i put a sandbag in there to add more weight oh man all right so we started this was it 3 30 4 30 we'll call it 5 30. congrats man 2 thousand dollars bro so congrats dude so that was a lot of fun and obviously he didn't know that his own iphone was literally a beacon device giving up his location the whole entire way which obviously made it a lot easier to find him nonetheless when he was at the mall tile zone service was still saying that the tracker was at the dog park which was kind of disappointing but nonetheless i think these apple air tags work very well and i'm going to be buying more but i thought this video would be fun and a little different so hopefully you guys enjoyed it and give it a thumbs up my name is armando thanks again for watching and you will catch you in the next one [Music] adios you music is about to change forever we're leaving stereo behind and entering the next dimension in sound with spatial audio featuring dolby atmos a premium audio experience where sound moves around you above you and behind you this is a completely immersive experience if you're a music fan it is like you're in the studio with your favorite artists i'm zane lowe and i'm here at the legendary capital studios and we're here to talk about this new evolution and sound we have some real heavy hitters true innovators behind the board the godfather of chicago rap one of the most respected in the business no id the incredible sylvia massey a pioneer in adventure recording and the master mix engineer himself manny marriken we're going to be talking about dolby atmos and spatial audio and how this is going to deepen the connection between the artist and the fan [Music] [Music] good to see you too how are you nice to meet you you too what's up bro how are you good good this is exciting it's very exciting for me because being such a fan of of each of you and the amazing work that you've done and what you've done for my favorite music and my favorite artists just to be in this room is enough but i'm exceptionally excited about the subject like we've seen music and everything change and technology change over the years but we've been waiting for this one right manny yeah man well thank you for inviting us having someone like yourself talk about what you know sound and the evolution and where we are in the world and what's ahead of us it's i'm sure i can speak for all of us but it's an exciting time for us you know i think the idea of innovation is something that artists are always striving for the idea of doing something new something fresh something that hasn't been done before and and i know that what got me into music in the first place was hearing something i'd never heard before the idea of what was possible and so i wanted to start this conversation by by asking each of you what was the significant moment in your life where you realized you discovered something that that really triggered that idea of what was possible like an innovation a piece of kit what was your toy what was the thing that was like this speaks to me dee i would pick two things i wouldn't pick one i would i would call it the turntable yeah which just introduced me to listening to music and being able to change the speed and spin it back and and not just listen and then a sampler yeah which is to be able to lift something off of there and be able to use it as a tool to create that that was just a okay i don't have to keep learning the saxophone only or playing this piano only there's there's other things that are unexplored and it and it opened me up to not being close-minded about sound art i mean both of those really opened up the door to this revolution where we're experiencing now which is this idea of of young artists and artists being able to create an immediate present moment on something that is at their fingertips and then distribute it direct to their audience and that sort of all starts around that time um sylvia the way you make things sound is so fascinating to me and and i feel like there's so many surprises in all the mixes that i've ever heard you do so i'm dying to know what that moment was for you well i think it uh one of the pieces of music that i that really affected me was um the pink floyd dark side of the moon it was so there was so much depth in it there was so much movement in it and it was uh it really sent me into uh suspension of disbelief so that was the experience that that really got me into the music i was doing my own music at the time but the recording is the recording studio was when i realized that that what the engineer does in the studio is very much like what the musician does there was a device in the 90s called the roland um the rss the spatial simulator and it was a it had a brain a rack mount brain and a little controller that you could spin these dials and it would simulate going around it didn't help the sound much it kind of thinned out the sound it was very early technology but it was doing what i wanted it to do and i used it on the tool records initially because i wanted that kind of surprise and i would take little voices and like on the tool record the opiate record uh if you listen very carefully during one of the drum solos danny's playing you'll hear a telephone ringing in the back and that was the rss i threw the telephone sound into the back of the room just to just to with the listeners you know so that you're you're really getting into this drum solo and then you hear the phone ringing i gotta turn down it's like i can imagine that tall with a perfect band to experiment with on that level because they sure like to with the listeners i love them for it um manny you know master mix engineer i gotta know like where did it all start for you i was lucky enough to go to uh my high school had a studio and uh it was i was in production class making a b playing some keys on the dx7 and my high school teacher said now you got to mix it i'm like what do you mean what does that even mean so uh he took me over over to uh aboard ramsa 16x8 and uh tascam eight you know rio de rio eight-track and he basically took the floppy into it and all of a sudden we recorded every instrument and we were ping-ponging and the fact that you were able to i just played the stuff maybe 20 minutes before and then he puts it through the desk and he's changing frequencies on the eq and you know and levels and balances and and i will never forget that moment of just this is what i wanted to do for the rest of my life because when you're able to change emotion with frequencies you know we talk about it all the time but when it happens to you for the first time and you're a 15 year old boy that just completely changed my my course you know i wanted to be a drummer and then i'm like no this is what i want to be i want to be in the studio because it's if i can change an emotion from someone else's you know art that's pretty powerful and i think we're blessed enough to be able to do that every single day of our lives you know i think that's a really important point about why we're having this conversation right now and and focusing on this idea of what spatial audio is because to me what struck me when i heard it for the first time was the way i felt i realized it changed the way i felt about a song that i knew inside out but i felt differently i could put on maps by yaya's or i could put on black skinhead or bonnie ver or beyonce record and i could feel a certain way in stereo and i sort of know it's going to get me at that moment right because you've all done great work and that's what you designed to do is to get me at that moment but i felt different it just felt different and i was experiencing a different emotional thing dion i want to ask you how you know it feels right when you're working on something we were having a conversation earlier and i was talking about do it wrong to get it right sometimes and it's just about how it feels and versus the technical mathematics that are stated to be correct and as human beings we just look for feelings all day so i know when a record feels good because i can feel an emotion or i can feel something so to speak versus just listening to it or it being correct or it being uh executed correctly it's just really about feeling for me so that that's the goal for me as a creator is to just create use sound to create feelings not just sound but in this scenario that's when i know it's correct you know it's a language that i think you have to be able to speak in order to translate if you have an artist in the room who's searching for a feeling words aren't really the best way to communicate a lot of the time and we all know that it's a it's a sensation almost that they're going for and it's hard to put that into words sylvia how do you how do you know when you're on the right path with an article how do you translate that that language to try to achieve what the artist is ultimately trying to get to the point it's all about the song initially and the intention of the writer of the song so if you can maintain that and still create a beautiful frame around that idea then that's that's what we do the idea of spatial audio though um is exciting because typically when we listen to stereo we have to kind of be in one spot and and we use the visual cues to uh to hear more than you even can imagine so the idea of the spatial is to take those speakers right out of the room you can close your eyes and as we sit here in this room i can hear the reflection on the back wall i can hear over in that corner and i can hear the space that we're in so the listening experience for for the audience uh is really enhanced because suddenly you take those those two speakers out of the equation and the entire room becomes the experience which is ultimately what i think was mozart was trying to achieve when he would create music and position the orchestra in certain points on the stage to make sure that that instrument reached that corner of the room and had a relationship with that instrument over here it's all about relationships isn't it it's amazing you know it's funny you say uh imagine the conductor right i mean he's got the sweetest spot in the room right he gets that energy from the orchestra but then he also hears the acoustic room in the back so to me that's a a good way to explain what's happening right now because we i think we can all agree that this is a sonic revolution yeah not since mono in the 30s have we gotten a revolution quite like this right because stereo and by the way we've tried i mean not we but we've tried with quad and 5.1 and you know there's been more speakers and stuff but i think for the first time ever the consumer will finally get to listen to what we've been talking about and what we've been trying to achieve and for me it's simple it's like am i listening listening to the music with the stereo speakers or or am i in the music and i think that's a really important thing to keep in mind on how now we have kind of the power going back to describing the motion with frequencies now we may have the power to take you inside of it and that to me is it is a sonic revolution and that's why we're super excited to be able to man to dive into that world and can you imagine now as creators you know and now you're creating anything what the creator is how the creators are going to create for it foreign that's crazy that's where it gets really really exciting yeah but see a lot of creatives i'm sure are asking you at this early stage and i know i'm getting asked the same question like what is it like what is it and we talk about being immersed in it we talk about the idea of music coming at you or being present in other parts of the three you know this kind of circular environment but that being said i think some people feel like it's going to land in music that i did in cinema which is like here comes the jet engine and it doesn't have to be like that it can be super subtle and it can actually you can do very little to achieve a lot with spatial audio right you know just the best way i can describe it in video is going back to the rabbit ears right the rabbit here antennas and then you fast forward to like 4k right i mean it's still the image but it's just very defined and you're in it now i remember when they went from to hd right it was like wow you can see everything and then video that that evolution happens so quickly right well that's about to happen in audio yeah uh sylvia you know you talk you've talked openly about your process you know adventure recording this is very much in parallel with that because it's you're going out there and saying okay i could take that sound effect that someone else has created i could go out and create it myself i could go out there and see what it's like to be in the natural environment what is that going to feel and sound like so this must feel like a natural space for you to be moving into already the idea of spatial sound is very exciting because i i consider rooms to be as important an instrument as the individual musicians and instruments in the song so when i record when i produce i oftentimes will do field trips and we'll go into a cave or we'll go into the subway or we'll go into this cathedral because not only do you uh enhance the the sounds that you're recording but your artist will give you a completely different perspective yeah if they're singing in a studio or if they're singing in a cathedral you're going to get a different performance yeah i'm always amazed that more recordings don't take place in natural environments and i understand the idea of soundproof rooms and you know the burgundy and black check and the windowless environment the standard kind of studio space but it always just blew my mind like why aren't we trying to move into an environment that's inspiring not just the way it sounds but inspiring the performance you know and i think that's what's going to happen here is people are going to be performing their music differently and creating their music differently dion what really drew you to in the first place like i know that you're a believer i know that you love where this is going what was it the experience like when you first discovered it just opens up new doors it's like okay you can do sing a note and then you can have three people sing harmony and then you go oh my god there's the choir the harmonies are cool yeah there's a choir now the choir is doing three parts harmony well what if the choir was here here yeah here here and here yeah what new feelings can i now generate for people that haven't been felt i got emotional the other day when i was listening to latch by disclosure i love sam's voice and when sam harmonizes with himself it's like kind of close to perfection for me and they the way that it just surrounded me i felt like it was i never heard anything like it and it was really moving and do you think throughout your life thus far in your career working with artists and all of you have worked with very innovative very forward-thinking artists that this has always been a place that that those kind of artists have wanted to get to but just haven't been able to yet do you think so absolutely so innovative artists are always looking to push the envelope right uh and i think this is gonna be the perfect sort of segue to what that is now you have all these tools all these new tools and new spaces and new uh just where to go because with stereo with two speakers you're just you're kind of trying to make the best out of it and we've i think we evolved into making really good records on two speakers uh the exciting part now is that we don't have those limitations anymore because you always end up with it with two channels no matter how fast you want to take it no matter how much you want to pan yeah how much you want to do pressure delays any of it you always end up with these two speakers but it's really for me what's really interesting is that i i didn't i haven't left the experience of discovering spatial audio feeling like i got cheated by stereo i love stereo and i love all of the innovation all the incredible work that's been done narrowing it down to two speakers and these records that were mixed in stereo all the records you've done and the millions of others that your peers have created over the decades are important they raised me i was born in stereo right well well me personally i i just always draw parallels so if i just look at you know you can watch a movie at home and that's okay or you can go to the theater and that's just a different experience and and life is the creator's role is to help create use technology to create new experiences so it's it's not an either or it's about expanding that functionality because you know we just happen to be at a point in time where we have everything in our hand and we can just listen and sometimes it cannot activate as many senses as we would want as a human so when you just give it a little more um again canvas you can now create different opportunities for experiences and again you know we talk about those two speakers but i know they know better than me like when you go to mix a record and you've got to cram all this stuff and now you're slicing things away to make space for things and what if you just don't have to take away now now that you can just move it and now it just breathes differently it feels differently and now it can be in different venues and different places because you don't have to overload these two speakers yeah and that's the exciting part because then you know you get some of these amazing artists to now get in there and the new generation now starts creating and and without the limitations that we've talked about like you said our limitations are how do you carve how do you shape to fit it into this box well now we don't have that limit limitation so can you imagine that as a creator where now you don't have to think about carving now the essence of that sound and those frequencies which moved you and you wanted to go home and cry because for whatever reason they touch a certain thing inside of you now nowadays you don't you don't have to carve it or shape it or anything it is the truest form because you have so much space and that equals to emotional connection to that song that artist that piece of music that's what i hope comes across the most is that people that we all acknowledge that there's a much there's a deeper emotional resonance that we can get out of listening to our favorite songs 100 and don't get me wrong i walk around all day going like this like everybody else because i'm into immediacy like everybody else it's part of my job is to be as up today as possible but i love how i feel when i listen to music and special genuinely like no cell like i just love how it makes me feel look i remember the first you know atmos mix that i worked on and you know i kept going back to the reference of stereo because i wanted my my approach was always to kind of do this you know and just make it bigger i guess yeah i'll never forget when i was toggling back and forth just to kind of stay true to the stereo uh version and remember feeling like i was in it which is i never i mean all these years i never felt that before and for us to get excited over something like that i mean the light bulb was like oh this is about to change forever not only for creators but for the consumer they're gonna again it's a different experience it's not replacing anything it's just adding to that experience and like you said you may wanna stay home and watch a film this friday and next week you may want to go with your friends and see it much bigger it's not going to replace it and i think that's really important to understand and remind ourselves that this is an amazing tool for everyone the revolution is here yeah i mean it's arrived and i think personally any stereo mix that i do from here on out uh we'll also have an atmos version because it'll be set up and i really believe that this is um this is the way the music should be should have always been experienced that's a powerful statement you know because it it speaks i think to the thousands and thousands of artists who have been moving with technology but haven't been able to get ahead of it and make the most of it and it does sort of feel the like anything is possible now from a creative point of view like i can imagine when you go into the studio now to help guide any creative into a vision that they have in their mind that you don't have to say give me a few days to try and figure that part out this is the role of great tech is to stretch our abilities like when we go in to create we want we don't want to be told no you know great art sometimes it's just throw it around because you know i grew up on mono oh no i'm not that i'm not that old but but at least in the stereo world you know again it's just always so many limitations and i think um people don't even know what what is possible and they've done this narrative like well people just listen to music on the phone people just you know it's an mp3 world if that's all we want to create that's okay but there will you know we will have to listen to that as this grows in into another space at some point and we want to really not be limited by the prisons at the moment so we might be actually able to with spatial now and the help of the artistic community and incredible creative people like yourselves be able to actually stop music from degenerating sound wise turn it around and encourage artists to actually think about the way their records sound even more yeah if you think about it every technology has moved forward right except sound yeah i mean that's right we're at an mp3 which is probably the worst quality that we've you know heard so for the first time in a long time yeah now we can actually move forward and i think we've all been waiting for this for this day for a long time because you know like i just went back to hd we're like man you can everything's so much better but audio is still not getting any better i think this is the first sign of things to come you know and uh and when the masses understand and they feel it we're not here to preach what it is just gotta hear it when you hear it on your own you're going to be kind of you get you're going to be hooked and you're going to want more of that and the more of us that understand that technology now the better music will get not only emotionally but sonically and that i think that's that's what we keep calling it a sonic revolution because we haven't seen this in our lifetime i mean remember when monitor stereo beetles put the drums on the left side and the bass on the right we're not doing that anymore but there's going to be a lot of experimentation and there's going to be a lot of things that we're going to do that are not going to necessarily be good but but it's here at least we have that option you know that's exciting sylvia are you thinking with that in mind i know that you love to record with artists in the room and you love to be as in the process as possible almost like you're live mixing a record while you're making it or in engineering that you sort of think starting to create with you know the idea of mixing and dolby atmos in mind if someone's performing a vocal you're thinking i know exactly how i'm going to manipulate that in an immersive space yeah it's it's exciting to have the new format because i'm i'm also a visual artist and i spend a lot of time painting so i kind of approach mixing in that way where you know there's lines and then there's negative space and these are all important while we're working in the mix we're working in the atmosphere we're placing things but then the spatial um finished mix is uh is like a whole new experience i want to talk a little bit about the the relationship between the artist and producer the artist and mixer the artist and engineer and and being in that moment when you're trying to facilitate and understand what they're trying to achieve but you have to lead them into into a place where mixing in dolby atmos makes sense moving and creating music that ultimately ends up being spatial makes sense how do you approach that right now well you know um to me stereo if i created the original mix i wanna i wanna have that essence because the artist producer everyone signed off on that right so i want to try to stay true to that but imagine now the possibilities of creating it at most right imagine that producer the young you know up and coming producer that can now you utilize space to create emotions and different frequencies and sounds now imagine the possibilities of that we you know we talk we always talk about stereo and the limitations of stereo as a creator now i can imagine some of those artists that i work with if they had all those colors at their disposal like right now it's made maybe monochromatic and now we have every color in the palette so it's new language you you you have to develop now additions to the conversations you've already been having absolutely but you know that's what we did well now not week but when they went from monitor stereo right i mean i'm sure there were a ton of conversations on how we were going to utilize two instead of one now imagine how up for the last what 90 years creators have been performing with two speakers now now to be able to create this dolby atmos it's gonna open up you know endless possibilities for creators i remember the first time i went to italy and i went to the vatican and i saw the the sistine chaplain of the sea like right it's just like oh i gotta walk over here and see it and and i go why what did he think when he had that much space to do he couldn't just paint a person or and it was just absolutely a whole new thought process right so i think it's really you know important that like all of our creative minds kind of grasp what's possible with they'll be atmos and spatial sound and all the different um processes that we will and tools so that we will use and then begin to rethink the product yeah yeah i think it's safe to say we're all most excited about what's to come the idea of new artists wanting to create and mix in dolby atmos from the creation point of view but what is your your current attitude about you know going back and and remixing and dolby atmos some of the music that you've already done and we've talked a little bit about this manny we've talked a bit about dion as well sylvia i want to know what your perspective is where would you start and let's see if we can just pick one artist or one project where would you start on something you'd worked on that you would that you've been dying to do adobe atmos mix in i work uh sometimes with a fellow named almond tobin and he's he's done music for gaming and films so the idea of taking that artist and and his um sounds are like no other person he's creating sounds it's all him and now he's singing too so to take that artist to take that music and with the dolby atmos put it into this spatial world that we can all just kind of get a big hug out of and there's so many other artists like things that people that i haven't worked with like radiohead i'm very excited about that i agree you know that that band would i think their work and what they do with nigel god rich and even you know some of tom york's solid material would be incredible yeah all right i bought you guys some time who who gets the most amount of time to think about this there's a you know one that comes to mind is like john mayer's continuum you know it's like that's like a that album always we always described it as giving us a hug and you mentioned that man it would be amazing to give it a real hug now you know so that that that would be one of those albums that i would just love to revisit or or like if the opportunity ever came up for like the moody blues days of future past and that kind of experience dark side of the moon which is what started the whole role get ready i mean pink floyd they would i would have jumped at it right all right dee any album from i would say earth wind and fire because the fact that there was already so much there and just to have a band with that many people yeah for me it's just about taking those things that were more that kind of got had to get cramped into a space and just kind of letting it fully true in earthworm fire we're reaching for the stars on every level yes i mean i've seen them live and it was just i don't i think that they were reaching for the rafters like and maybe bobby mcferrin interesting weirdest thought that would just happen just to know like putting notes all over the place and really oh my goodness somebody who not to similar mozart did a run of shows in churches and in acoustic environments with no amplification just with the choir and no electronic instruments whatsoever just voice in the church what i'm really looking forward to is taking the mix and having it just be atmos or just be spatial i agree that was great it was really really great to be able to spend this time with you as i said at the beginning of our conversation i'm such a big fan of your work but to be able to hear what the future holds gosh it's time to be excited i think artists and music is about to change forever we've said it i tr i really believe it to be true and if you want to find out for yourself then you can go and experience dolby atmos and spatial right now in apple music subscribers can listen to thousands of songs in a whole new dimension it really is time to find out what the future in music sounds like you Even in the midst of flowing time, oppression spins round and round. I can't even see the heart that's leaving me, didn't you know? I can't even get myself to move, slipping through the cracks of time. I don't know anything about what's around me,
I'm just me and no more. Am I dreaming? Or seeing nothing? Are my words useless even if I speak? I'm just tired of being sad
I should go on without feeling anything Even if you give me the words; I'm at 
 a loss for
My heart just won't pay attention If I can move, if everything changes, it will go dark. Is there a future for someone like me? Will I still exist in a world like this? Is this painful? Is it sad?
Not even knowing myself. I'm just tired even of walking, I don't even understand people. If someone like me can change, if I change, will it turn white? Even in the midst of flowing time, oppression spins round and round. I can't even see the heart that's leaving me, didn't you know? I can't even get myself to move slipping through the cracks of time. I don't know anything about what's around me, I'm just me and no more. Am I dreaming? Or seeing nothing? Are my words useless even if I speak? I'm just tired of being sad;
I should go on without feeling anything. Even if you give me the words; I'm at 
 a loss for
My heart just won't pay attention. If I can move, if everything changes, it will go dark. Is there a future to come out of this useless 
 time?
Will I exist in a place like this? If I wanted to tell you what kind of person I 
 am, the words I'd use would be "good for nothing". Will I exist in a place like this?
Will 
 I exist in a time like this? If someone like me can change, if I change, will it turn white? Am I dreaming now? Or seeing nothing?
Are my words useless even if I speak? I'm just tired of being sad;
I should go on without feeling anything. Even if you give me the words I'm at a 
 loss for, my heart just won't pay attention. If I can move, if everything changes, it will all go dark. If I move, If I move,
everything will break, everything will break. If I'm sad, if I'm sad, will my heart be able to turn white? I still know nothing about you, about me, about anything. If I can open my heavy eyelids, if I break everything, turn black!

just gonna be happy with what we got no no no no no that's not why you're here you're here for the latest leaks the scoops apple leaking the m1x macbook pro apple leaking the new intel based mac pro apple leaks about new ipads there's so much good stuff to talk about today as always so if you're excited drop a like down below to seriously help me and the channel out and of course hit that subscribe button so you're always staying up to date on the latest apple news let's go ahead and get get jumping in let's go ahead just die well look at us in the leaks whoa but before jumping into the leaks of course a new episode of genius bar is out it's me and john prosser talking all about wwdc i confront him and say you told me there was a macbook pro coming where is the macbook pro as promised it's super entertaining and if you guys want to check it out a link is down below per usual okay jumping into things where do we even start off i say we start off with the new ipad news because bloomberg's mark german you know mark gurmey bloomy mark gurmey love you buddy he's actually really great he's 90 accurate essentially the best apple source in the game is out with some fresh details about a number of new ipads in his latest report german talks about the next ipad mini being redesigned a new version of the base level 329 ipad and also the 2022 ipad pro so let's start off with all the details here because there's a lot and let's start at the base ipad it's the 329 one generally what apple just recycles somewhat new technology into to keep costs down for the 2021 ipad 9 it's just going to be thinner and lighter and that's like really the only detail we have and that apple will continue to target it towards students we don't know if this means like support for the second apple pencil finally or if thinner and lighter means a new design it just sounds like we're basically gonna be getting the same you know it's the base ipad we don't expect a lot here it's the base 329 like i said it's just everything apple's done in years past that's finally cheap enough to put into something that is really the the base possible tablet apple sells and it's always been weird to me that that is actually a cheaper tablet than the ipad mini which is significantly smaller and for a lot of you you know whenever i say ipad mini you're probably a little triggered because it hasn't been updated in a while number one and number two because when it is generally updated it's a new processor and the same screen like the ipad mini is fundamentally the same product today as it was when it came out and i think 2013. remember steve jobs didn't want an ipad mini and then you know tim cook came in and was like minnie i bet many happened for everybody all of this in mind over the past few months you've probably seen these dumb renders and concepts of the ipad pro mini you know but that's not gonna happen so stop dreaming okay i should be honest with you well that was the consensus because no one credible had actually said there was gonna be a redesign but mark german in this latest report said there is going to be a redesign and described it like this the new ipad mini is going to have slimmer bezels and the updated design could even remove the home button and i'll be honest there's no need for these big bezels on the top and bottom if there's no home button which seems to pretty clearly suggest that it's going to be a mini ipad pro or maybe more specifically more accurately a mini version of the ipad air i mean who knows could the ipad mini come in colors like the ipad air i i wouldn't be shocked that and the fact that john prosser and renders by ian actually showed us today what the new ipad mini looks like i want to go over these images because they're real nice i mean honestly there's not that much to go over it's exactly what we were just talking about it's like a mini version of the ipad pro you've got your slimmer bezels you've likely got face id but it could also be touch id on here as well you've got a larger screen an all screen design you've got a camera system on the back most broadly you've got the same routed rectangle design that we see on the iphone 12 that you see on the ipad pro that you see on the ipad air that you're going to see on the new macbooks that you're going to see on the new apple watch apple's all in for this rounded rectangle and speaking of which it is on the 2018 ipad pro that we saw this new era of design language debut and considering that it's been for years and the ipad pro really looks identical now as it did in 2018 aside from some minor camera tweaks it's time for an upgrade in 2022. we're getting like an all new ipad pro next year and what we haven't heard a lot about like if the squared rounded rack design language is changing we have heard about the materials used to make it and you know how the ipad has been aluminum since the ipad came out and it's light it's cheap and it's fine but the iphone 7 was also fine being metal and there was no reason to keep it around because it turns out when you change the the material on the back which is what apple is doing they are giving the ipad a glass back which is going to be so premium i'm beyond excited for this like the aluminum's fine i just like the glass i'm a huge fan of the iphone ever since they switched from aluminum to glass and with that you get some big upgrades first of all wireless charging is coming qi enabled charging on the ipad pro now i don't have anything like properly sized to charge a 12.9 inch ipad pro but i'll get real creative and it turns out apple's going to be addressing this as well because there's going to be a magsafe like system that apple ships alongside the new ipads how long has the screen been out has this been out the entire time there we go all right i don't know if it's been out but it's back now listen but that's great right the wireless charging being there is cool but there is one feature that's also coming and that's reverse wireless charging which is something that was rumored to be on the iphone and just hasn't happened yet and this is going to allow you to set your air pods or possibly even an apple watch on the back of your ipad and it will use your ipad's battery to chi charge them which is oh such a good idea it's this giant battery pack that happens to be a tablet i mean the same thing could be said with the iphone like i'm always at the gym and my airplanes just always die i'm not always at the gym i just got back in like the first time in you know a month i was slacking but listen every time i go like clockwork i swear to god the little airpods go and then they die and how do i charge them i gotta go all the way back into my apartment like two floors and i have to charge them and it's it's heartbreaking and i'd appreciate if you guys would be my support group but you don't have to be my point is that this is a cool technology that we haven't seen on an apple product yet where samsung users have been enjoying it on the galaxy series forever and i'm ready i want to see this on the ipad and that alone makes the glass back worth it so that's the ipad news for this video we're gonna take a short break we're gonna you know get we vpn up and then we're gonna jump right back into some good stuff so here we go but listen if this guy's not gonna sit here and tell you the truth then i will he ain't been using protection he's been raw dogging everything out there all right and he's caught em all as they say he's gotta start being safe online he's gotta use wheat by my ex it went away but he's gotta use we vpn listen you guys know we vpn they're the guys that came from all the other vpn companies doing sketchy stuff with your data to create a fundamentally better product it was one of the best fastest and most reliable options on the entire market and recently i've heard some birds chirping outside which means that it's spring and we vpn has launched their spring sale for the two years plan which gets you 73 off and two months for free at only 2.69 a month this gives you access to all their premium features over 50 server locations around the world and even the ability to unblock content from netflix hulu bbc iplayer and so much more and when you enter the code i updated checkout you get an additional 10 off so my challenge is this whether you've been using a different vpn for years yuck or is your first time hearing about a vpn head over to wevpn.com i update today if you trust me if you like what i do here and start staying safer online how was that did you guys enjoy it all right welcome back listen there is did a gunshot just go off did you guys hear that that's my oven so we started off with the ipad and now i want to follow up with some mac stuff because apple has leaked two things that are just huge okay and i have so many thoughts on them the first is a literal m1x macbook pro the second is a new intel based mac pro i want to start off with the intel thing because i just want to get intel out of the way you know we're basically done talking about this but there is actually one more intel mac in the pipeline and that is an intel base map how do we know this sam you always talk about leaks and rumors and i don't like when you do that because i like confirmation straight from the little birdie named tim cook well i like the little birdie tim cook too he's snacking around sometimes well that's what we got here because there is a bug on my light are you kidding me that was a great take bug anyway for the new intel mac pro it is going to be the last mac mark german confirmed this on twitter but also we don't need confirmation from leakers on this one why oh because apple just leaked it themselves a developer over on twitter found that in xcode 13 the first beta that got released alongside ios 15 mac os monterey and everything else that apple just unveiled at wwdc there is a reference to an ice lake intel mac and with apple transitioning the macbooks very shortly more on the macbooks in a second with apple transition in the mac mini later and the imac already started its transition there's no more intel max aside from this one geared toward the professional market coming and we have no specs or details here just that it's going to be intel's ice lake chips but this is one of those updates that i would expect a very small press release for if not just a general site update like the mac pro is an important product to apple but it's very niche it's not mass market and it's gonna be something that apple just updates overnight super subliminally but i would expect that to come relatively soon definitely before the end of 2021. now there's another product that we're waiting for there's another product that a lot of us were disappointed we didn't see at wwdc and a product that was supposed to come out right it felt like summer was the right time mark german said summer john prosser said wwdc reputable sources said we'd be getting new 14 and 16 inch macbook pros with an m1x inside but that's the thing with rumors and leaks is that at the end of the day they can break down and as much as i trust in these people and i think you should broadly trust them as well they can be wrong and apple's plans can change but a fellow youtuber by the name of max balzer uh who's been doing some great content he noticed something really weird after wwdc ended this year he was looking through the tags of apple's wwdc keynote and he noticed a couple that stuck out you know they were the normal ones like apple or wwdc or apple event or ios but then at the end there were two more one that said m1x macbook pro and the second that just said m1 x in the official description in the metadata section of this youtube video apple has written the words m1x a chip that hasn't been released and m1x macbook pro a computer that hasn't been released now i've seen some takes on this i've seen quite a few you know all these little marketing gurus out there they said please i know nothing about the internet this is for seo you might have heard that phrase seo seo search engine optimization look i'm even gonna put it in post search engine optimization does that mean i know what i'm talking about in my case yes because i literally do this for a living and i know a lot about seo but here's the thing why would apple need that why would apple click bait in the metadata a product that didn't come out and that currently doesn't exist i don't think it was for the seo sorry everybody on reddit that's heartbroken let's say it was for search engine optimization let's say it would get more clicks of apple put this in the description okay well i can tell you what's a lot hotter than macbook pro m1x which is highly niche still a iphone 13 iphone 12s new ipad apple watch airpods these are all tags that apple could have put in here as well about apple watch series 7 and airpods pro 2. i'm sure that would have been great but did they no they just referenced this macbook pro in here that's a standout so i think this is intentional and we don't know why yet but as discussed on my genius bar podcast with john there's apparently a press briefing that nobody knows what it's for in a couple of weeks so i'll keep you guys updated but i really think these macbook pros are just around the corner why did we not see these well digitimes says it's because there were some component delays for the mini led displays so it seems like it's out of apple's control and i fully believe they wanted to announce these macbook pros now they just weren't ready quite yet isn't this fascinating that apple did this i i'm blown away by this movie it's just crazy uh and i hope it was intentional i hope it was a hint and i hope it was fun hope you guys had fun watching this video if you did drop a like down below hit subscribe for more so you're always staying up to date listen there's one place to get apple news it's right it's right here did you think i was gonna say that i was gonna say something else funnier to like get you guys to laugh but just here just me just sam all right love you guys hope you're doing well and i'll see you in my next video peace [Music] you nobody does it quite like apple they've taken this super powerful m1 chip from the latest macbooks and put it in the brand new 2021 ipad pro along with more ram more storage freekin thunderbolt and arguably the most advanced display on a mobile device period i am really happy about this direction because the thing is everyone including us knows at this point that the ipad pro is not just a computer it's a computer for legitimate pros so if that's the case why does apple keep treating it like a toy for children to watch youtube and play cut the rope there's still no file copy progress bar you can't sideload apps it deserves better and this is bull spit yeah hi hi i'm riley uh linus needs a little break so i'm going to tell you about our sponsor anchor the anchor nano 2 uses the latest second gen gallium nitride technology which allows charging up to 65 watts in a small compact frame learn more at the link in the video description or at the end of the video [Music] i'm sorry i lost my composure it's just that the saga of the ipad pro has been a bit of a wild ride for me i went from being excited about the future of truly pro tablets to disappointed about apple's premature it's a computer messaging when spoiler it wasn't yet then back to excited about the computer-like features of ipad os the magic keyboard learning about the workflows of real professional ipad os users they're out there we even edited the last video about the ipad pro on the ipad pro and according to mark it was pretty good but having just crested a high point i find myself conflicted about the latest iteration on the one hand apple has upgraded almost every aspect of this machine it's a hair thicker than last year sure but the m1 soc's eight cpu cores eight gpu cores 16 neural engine cores paired with up to 16 gigs of ram and two terabytes of storage makes it by far the most powerful tablet ever because no that thing doesn't count now most people won't actually end up with that top spec because paying 2100 us dollars for a tablet is actually illegal in many jurisdictions fbi open up but hey if you're the sort of person who buys a new car when you run out of gas then i guess you're above the law anyway so apple's got you covered now in terms of performance in geekbench the m1 absolutely embarrasses its predecessor but in real world situations like lumafusion and premier rush rendering it only boasts a modest improvement in procreate for example you can work with three or four more layers but that's it and it seems like the reason for this is that most ipad apps haven't been updated yet to be able to make proper use of the new horsepower including not being able to use more than 5 gigabytes of ram i'm sure the situation will improve soon procreate is apparently already planning to add the ability to work with 3d models but for now you might find yourself in a bit of a driving a formula one to work type situation it's also enabled apple to take the game-changing edition of usb-c on previous ipad pros and kick it up a notch thanks to its support for thunderbolt and usb4 this port's bandwidth went from 10 to 40 gigabit per second allowing the new ipad pro to connect more displays drives and accessories and even power apple's 6k pro display xdr though i suspect that most of the people accessorizing their ipad with a 5 000 monitor treat our high quality lttstore.com water bottles as single use the camera and lidar sensor module on the back is pretty much the same as before but this ipad pro has a new 12 megapixel ultra wide front facing camera whose true purpose is to enable center stage this feature is super cool it allows the camera to zoom in and follow you around in your video calls and can help keep multiple people in the frame at once even if they're the sort that tends to kind of drift off that's really cool even if it reminds me of the facebook portal which was less cool like i know apple is probably stealing my data even though they say they don't but for some reason it's more comforting imagining tim apple watching me through the ipad camera than the zuck oh linus i love your passion but i will never answer your emails finally there's the most forward-facing upgrade the new liquid retina xdr display that is 10 whole syllables to say every single time but it's worth it it's got 10 000 mini leds split into over 2500 dimming zones a 1 million to 1 contrast ratio and a whopping 1 000 nits of sustained brightness 1600 peak now mini led displays aren't capable of the infinite contrast and perfect blacks of an oled display so there is some visible blooming in certain scenarios such as viewing white text on a black background but when viewing hdr content the difference between this ipad pro and the 2020 model is obvious enough that even people who don't get sweaty thinking about hybrid log gamma are gonna notice the xdr display is also great for creators whether you prefer the moving pictures or the still kind the m1 ipad pro now has both the horsepower and the display to craft content with rich colors and deep contrast it's just too bad that this fabulous screen is attached to a tablet that starts at eleven hundred dollars before you add the 350 keyboard accessory ah yes here comes the tone shift in this video because the thing is no matter how many times apple calls this thing a computer after five generations of ipad pros now they've made it abundantly clear through their actions that they don't actually want it to be as good as your computer in some of our previous ipad videos we've opted to look on the bright side of ipad os's deficiencies especially in the context of mac os or windows users who are trying to switch because the thing is i get it ipads aren't for those people they're for ipad users and fair enough once you master ipad os multitasking get used to the system's quirks and learn how to use some of these surprisingly robust apps that are specifically designed for the ipad it can be a capable and super portable daily driver but the weird thing is apple must know that those people exist and yet they outright refuse to add functionality to ipad os to make their lives just a little bit better i mean we're talking about stuff here that's just basic on other operating systems connecting to servers and transferring large files is still heinously bad there's no progress bar and the m1 ipad pro has more cpu cores and more memory which helps it go faster but unless you check in on the file transfer later you will never know if it actually completed or if it wigged out and like i don't want to out anyone but i saw some ipad enthusiast content creators that were praising the new ipad pro because it was able to complete file transfers in the background without failing that's not a feature that's the bare minimum and ipad os multitasking has come a long way but there's still some weird quirks you know like you can have three apps active on a screen at once that's great two in split screen and one in slide over but in order to add an app to slide over you have to go to the home screen open the app go back to the app you were using before drag up the dock then drag the app from the recent app section up to slide over for context this way of opening a windowed app was also designed by an apple engineer the ipad team should hire them any monitors that you might connect to the fancy new thunderbolt port they will still only duplicate the ipad screen they won't extend it why would you want two of the same thing onto two screens at the same time and as for the app situation the truth is desktop versions are still more functional lumafusion procreate they're great but what if you like photoshop apple and adobe have been beating the full photoshop on the ipad drum for years but according to apple's own timepiece it is now 2021 and they're still working on that adding basic desktop features like the magic wand raw file support and sharpening and don't get me started on the fact that ipad os unlike mac os windows and android doesn't allow the side loading of apps outside of the app store an issue that's received more attention in the wake of epic's lawsuit just let them win apple i would definitely give this thing a higher score if i could just download on it the worst part of all of this is that apple spends almost 20 billion dollars a year on research and development let that number soak into your mind and then think knowing that the only possible conclusion to draw is that when an apple product doesn't have some basic functionality like tracking your rollerblading workout on the apple watch it's because they just don't want it to so coming back to the ipad pro then if it's hard to use as a computer it's because apple wants it that way they've added a few things here and there to appease the more computer minded among us but they've also refused to do these obvious things that would take it from a usable computer to a great one and this inner struggle over the identity of the ipad was on full display during the epic trial where craig federighi testified that ios was designed to be simple and safe enough for infants okay i guess that's fair but then why market the ipad pro as a computer replacement for professionals when it's running software designed for babies in your own words now we're currently filming this video two days before wwdc 2021 where apple is expected to announce some new features for the ipad os and maybe they'll add a file transfer progress bar and support for extended displays and full fat ports of desktop apps and support for third-party app stores while they're at it but so far the rumors point to more along the lines of allowing you to arrange widgets on the home screen however you like though that would be an improvement sadly enough speaking of improving improve your charging speeds with our sponsor anchor anker's nano 2 wall chargers can charge this ipad up to 80 percent faster than the stock 20 watt charger and can charge an iphone up to three times faster than its stock charger does it even include a charger anymore it uses the latest gallium nitride technology allowing it to both charge faster and generate less heat and is up to 58 smaller than other foldable wall bricks there are three different versions 30 watt 45 watt and 65 watt and is also compatible with samsung super fast charging so why wait go check it out the 65 watt version is capable of charging most laptops that can be charged via usbc and it's like this big we're gonna have it linked down below if you guys enjoyed this video you might enjoy our previous video editing an ipad video on the ipad because we learned a lot about how this thing really is a professional computer even if apple refuses to make it one and i am not going to put up with hi i'm lana i'm linus what's going on guys it's your average what's going on guys it's your average consumer today we've got a very special consumer today we've got a very special video video apple just had their wwdc event where apple just had their wwdc event where they announced they announced a ton of stuff but i think what caught a ton of stuff but i think what caught the attention of most people the attention of most people is all the new stuff coming to facetime is all the new stuff coming to facetime so i was lucky enough to get a little so i was lucky enough to get a little time with craig federighi time with craig federighi the senior vice president of software the senior vice president of software engineering over at apple engineering over at apple you know the guy in all of the keynotes you know the guy in all of the keynotes we spent a little bit of time talking we spent a little bit of time talking and of course i had to ask the burning and of course i had to ask the burning question question how did we end up getting facetime on how did we end up getting facetime on android android and other platforms through the browser and other platforms through the browser but why are we seeing this now but why are we seeing this now so of course i had to ask the man so of course i had to ask the man himself and check it out he got some himself and check it out he got some pretty cool answers pretty cool answers hello hey craig how's it going hello hey craig how's it going it is going all right it's a exciting it is going all right it's a exciting time of the year for time of the year for for those of us in software i'm sure you for those of us in software i'm sure you guys have to be super busy with guys have to be super busy with everything you announced everything you announced it's it's yeah it's it's crazy busy it's it's yeah it's it's crazy busy getting ready for uh wwdc and then it's getting ready for uh wwdc and then it's it's it's crazy busy during wwdc so um crazy busy during wwdc so um but but exciting time of year to finally but but exciting time of year to finally take all that stuff that's been take all that stuff that's been a secret and finally being able to talk a secret and finally being able to talk about it with everyone and show it with about it with everyone and show it with our our friends and family and so it's it's friends and family and so it's it's great great of course of course now you guys of course of course now you guys announced a ton of great stuff announced a ton of great stuff but i gotta say what really caught my but i gotta say what really caught my attention has to be attention has to be facetime you guys blew me blew me away facetime you guys blew me blew me away with how many things you announced for with how many things you announced for facetime facetime uh but what really caught my attention uh but what really caught my attention was facetime links was facetime links yeah so with facetime links i'm really yeah so with facetime links i'm really curious on your take what caused curious on your take what caused apple to want to branch out to i guess apple to want to branch out to i guess like different operating systems like different operating systems allowing allowing facetime to be available in in some facetime to be available in in some capacity capacity on platforms that you don't typically on platforms that you don't typically see uh you know apple software right see uh you know apple software right well you know i i think a lot of how we well you know i i think a lot of how we think about building think about building products is uh about what we all products is uh about what we all want for ourselves and i think and want for ourselves and i think and because we think because we think you know we're apple users and apple you know we're apple users and apple fans too right that's that's why we're fans too right that's that's why we're here really here really right and we certainly found ourselves right and we certainly found ourselves during especially this period during especially this period doing those kinds of get-togethers with doing those kinds of get-togethers with friends and family friends and family and you know very often there was and you know very often there was someone in in a large group who maybe someone in in a large group who maybe didn't have an apple device you know and didn't have an apple device you know and you you don't want to shut them out of you you don't want to shut them out of the party the party uh and uh and yet we didn't want to have uh and uh and yet we didn't want to have to go to go use something other than uh than use something other than uh than facetime and so we thought you know facetime and so we thought you know as an apple customer what do you want as an apple customer what do you want well you you do want to be able to pull well you you do want to be able to pull in in all your friends or all your family all your friends or all your family members into it and members into it and you know web technologies in terms of you know web technologies in terms of what the browser was capable of for what the browser was capable of for video conferencing video conferencing had gotten to the point where the had gotten to the point where the building blocks were there finally building blocks were there finally where we could build an end-to-end where we could build an end-to-end encrypted encrypted facetime client that could run in the facetime client that could run in the browser and that the browser and that the common phones and windows pcs could common phones and windows pcs could support so finally we had support so finally we had we had what we needed to uh to do it and we had what we needed to uh to do it and i felt like it was the i felt like it was the the perfect thing to kind of cap off the perfect thing to kind of cap off what what we were broadly doing around what what we were broadly doing around improving the the facetime experience improving the the facetime experience and trying to bring everyone and trying to bring everyone uh together all right oh yeah i can uh together all right oh yeah i can definitely definitely see how the events of like you know the see how the events of like you know the past year can past year can really influence these new changes and really influence these new changes and you know just allowing for more to you know just allowing for more to happen with like you know the current happen with like you know the current software software so i mean it's cool to see that so i mean it's cool to see that evolution so i i'm evolution so i i'm i think everybody's kind of stoked for i think everybody's kind of stoked for it um but how has apple's philosophy it um but how has apple's philosophy overall because i noticed with like you overall because i noticed with like you know little things like airplay becoming know little things like airplay becoming more available on other platforms and more available on other platforms and now you know we're getting a little bit now you know we're getting a little bit of face time of face time how has like the philosophy changed how has like the philosophy changed around that or is it like more of a around that or is it like more of a you know case-by-case basis that you're you know case-by-case basis that you're seeing a need for seeing a need for new platforms yeah i i don't i don't new platforms yeah i i don't i don't think there's really been a think there's really been a philosophical shift philosophical shift as much as certain kinds of things you as much as certain kinds of things you know you think about know you think about usb you know you could plug any keyboard usb you know you could plug any keyboard any mouse because there was a standard any mouse because there was a standard for that kind of connectivity and you'd for that kind of connectivity and you'd expect that right i should be able to expect that right i should be able to buy any mouse or keyboard i want and use buy any mouse or keyboard i want and use it with my it with my with my mac and so when it came to with my mac and so when it came to things like things like getting video wirelessly from your getting video wirelessly from your iphone to a television well it's no iphone to a television well it's no longer about longer about a cord uh it's it's about some kind of a cord uh it's it's about some kind of wireless wireless uh protocol and so in that case we uh protocol and so in that case we we wanted to create the virtual cord in we wanted to create the virtual cord in the form of airplay and get it get it the form of airplay and get it get it out there so you could do out there so you could do that kind of thing with with your phone that kind of thing with with your phone or with or with you know we do integration with you know we do integration with audio to all kinds of different speakers audio to all kinds of different speakers um that we can we can orchestrate with um that we can we can orchestrate with third parties and again it's taking what third parties and again it's taking what where there were standards in the wired where there were standards in the wired world and making sure that you still had world and making sure that you still had those options to connect those options to connect and so i think i think when it comes to and so i think i think when it comes to connectivity um connectivity um we look at it from the perspective of we look at it from the perspective of what what do our customers what what do our customers uh really want to connect to and and uh really want to connect to and and that enriches their that enriches their their experience with their with their their experience with their with their iphone or with their ipad or with their iphone or with their ipad or with their mac mac and and we want to make that possible and and we want to make that possible well that's well that's i mean i think it's been really cool i mean i think it's been really cool that you guys have been that you guys have been focusing it feels like you guys have focusing it feels like you guys have been focusing so much more on been focusing so much more on just like what the end user like that's just like what the end user like that's always been apple's thing the end user's always been apple's thing the end user's experience experience but it almost feels like there's this but it almost feels like there's this sense of sense of apple's really listening now or it's apple's really listening now or it's it's interesting it's interesting because i i you know apple's always been because i i you know apple's always been about the user experience that's about the user experience that's that's why app it is what it is but that's why app it is what it is but there's this there's this new sense of like you know apple's new sense of like you know apple's really thinking about really thinking about what we want and providing it so i think what we want and providing it so i think that's it's all awesome stuff that's it's all awesome stuff oh that's that's great i mean i i do oh that's that's great i mean i i do think we're think we're we're all passionate apple enthusiasts we're all passionate apple enthusiasts ourselves and so we've ourselves and so we've we've always been trying to build the we've always been trying to build the things that uh that we felt we we wanted things that uh that we felt we we wanted and i think and i think you know a lot of different threads kind you know a lot of different threads kind of came together this year that made it of came together this year that made it possible to possible to to pull together what what what we did to pull together what what what we did and i'm i'm super excited to hear it's and i'm i'm super excited to hear it's resonating with you resonating with you because it certainly is with us because it certainly is with us absolutely absolutely so thank you for absolutely

you see you bye bye so there you have it guys right from bye so there you have it guys right from craig's mouth himself craig's mouth himself we are now seeing you know things like we are now seeing you know things like facetime come to all these different facetime come to all these different platforms platforms because the the world's changing like because the the world's changing like browser security has been changed browser security has been changed you know apple's really really huge you know apple's really really huge about privacy and making sure about privacy and making sure everything is encrypted so that you everything is encrypted so that you don't have to worry about safety so it's don't have to worry about safety so it's really cool to see that browsers have really cool to see that browsers have now reached a point now reached a point where apple feels confident enough in where apple feels confident enough in them to support facetime and have it be them to support facetime and have it be a safe connection a safe connection i know i don't want anybody getting in i know i don't want anybody getting in on my facetime calls so i'm glad apple on my facetime calls so i'm glad apple prioritized that and it kind of makes prioritized that and it kind of makes sense with the state of where we are sense with the state of where we are today today web conferencing is huge and i'm sure web conferencing is huge and i'm sure there's like there's like a lot of progression in that field now a lot of progression in that field now if you have an apple device and you want if you have an apple device and you want to get on facetime with someone else to get on facetime with someone else you can send them a link and kind of you can send them a link and kind of make it happen now of course make it happen now of course there were way more things that happened there were way more things that happened at wwdc if you guys at wwdc if you guys missed my recap video i'll have it missed my recap video i'll have it linked down below in the description but linked down below in the description but huge shout out to craig for jumping on huge shout out to

Blood-red footsteps remain Why does that icy decision
Hurt me so, was it a mistake Ooh no, this sweet scent
Bright ruby drops draw me in Ooh no, lead me more into temptation Yes, your scent your color
Infuse me with pleasure Callin' me Callin' me Callin' me 
The world inside me crumbles Glittering crystal Nearer, nearer, nearer
Until my lips desire your red allure Come & Dance with me Dance the fiery dance, starlight shines in me Translucent glass beads glowing red Don’t look back, don’t let yourself worry In the sweet darkness the witching hour descends We O wow wow wow wow
We O ya ya ya ya We O wow wow wow wow
Infusing with color all my grey decisions Nothing, no words can stop me here
Past my fingers and lips streams of red nectar fall Dizzying scent draws me near
I like it, I like it, more I like it all Callin' me Callin' me Callin' me
The world inside me crumbles Glittering crystal Nearer, nearer, nearer
Until my lips desire your red allure Come & Dance with me Dance the fiery dance, starlight shines in me Translucent glass beads glowing red Don’t look back, don’t let yourself worry In the sweet darkness the witching hour descends We O wow wow wow wow
We O ya ya ya ya We O wow wow wow wow 
Infuse with color all my grey decisions There’s no turning back when the night turns restless
Let the festival I dared to imagine come alive Dream the red dream, endless and deep
Let rise the shimmering light of destruction Don’t agonize, let go the timid child
Take me, the endless witching hour descends We O wow wow wow wow
Dance, dance We O ya ya ya ya
The stars rise, rise We O wow wow wow wow 
Dance, dance Infuse with color all my grey decisions Was it my imagination? Talk to me. I have visions. I write them down, and... people pay to read them. Scott had a history of
becoming unstuck... to reality. Where'd you go? He called it being "gone". Where'd you go? I don't know how to do this
without you. Come back. I'm on a bool hunt. What's a bool hunt? Like a scavenger hunt, Scott and his brother made up
when they were kids. Mrs. Landon, I just thought I'd give it
one more try in person. Scott's unpublished works
need to be collected, examined-- You are never
going to see his papers. She won't let them go. I'll get those papers for you. Scott Landon's books changed me. Do you remember that night
you asked if I was crazy? I believed in it. That's how strong
his imagination is. There's a place. I'll take you there. What is this? Where are we? If you solve all the riddles, find all the clues, then you get a prize. Where we went today, was it real? Or was it my imagination? ♪ I said Doctor ♪ ♪ Mr. M.D. ♪ ♪ Won't you tell me ♪ ♪ What's wrong with me ♪ He's gone, but he keeps pushing me. Toward what? Was it real? Or was it my imagination? taylor swift is apple music songwriter of the year for 2020. congratulations and thank you for bringing us not one but two incredible albums this year these records just steeped in imagery and escapism and romance and heartache and just remarkable examples of you as a songwriter we've always known but masterclass stuff so thanks so much for showing up twice this year taylor thank you for saying that um yeah it's it's amazing we just put out evermore uh yesterday so i'm i'm in this state of like exhaustion but relief but very proud so i was going to ask you actually how it feels because i mean you've done this you know a few times now working up the morning after records finally come out and i think as fans we all know the effort and the energy that you put into not just writing the songs and getting them complete but preparing the release of the music and ensuring that we're as engaged as possible so when it's all out and about and that whole process finally kind of comes to an end for the time being how do you feel the next morning are you are you well rested is the energy too intense what's the what's the situation i feel differently today than i felt the day after releasing folklore because even the day after releasing folklore aaron and i were still bouncing ideas back and forth and and we just knew we were going to keep writing music i didn't know if it was for an album of mine or um aaron and justin vernon have a really amazing project called big red machine so we kept writing thinking maybe we were going to do some big big red machine stuff but the things that we ended up writing really sounded more like more like a continuation of folklore so when i put out folklore i remember just feeling so proud and happy but still like foot on the gas like let's keep let's keep going this is fun i'm not finished with this and everybody all my collaborators we all felt the same way about it so we just kept going with this one i have this feeling of of sort of quiet conclusion and sort of this weird serenity of like we did what we did what we set out to do and we're all really proud of it and that feels really really nice i'm not surprised because i feel like the stories to some degree there's some conclusion in this in this album too from where you began on folklore and there's so much closure on this new record and i want to dive into aspects of that and i just feel like the future must feel wide open to you right now but i want to refer back to the long pond sessions you know and jack anthony said something really poignant which was i've never made an album like this i don't know if i ever will again yes and in your mind and in your heart you knew you wanted to carry on and there was music to be done but it felt like for others assuming that jack was genuine because he's an honest human he wasn't sure there would be an ever more or a chance to work like this again was there a sort of melancholy to the end of folklore not really i was just so happy that my world felt opened up creatively um there was a point where i that i got to as a writer who only wrote very diuristic songs that i felt it was unsustainable from from my future moving forward it felt like too hot of a microscope it felt a bit like i was just i was like why am i just like if i'm writing about my life and all it is at on my bad days i would feel like i was loading a cannon of click bait when that's not what i want for my life um and i think that when when i put out folklore i felt like if i can do this this thing where i get to create characters in this mythological american town or wherever i imagined them and i can reflect my own emotions onto what i think they might be feeling and i can create stories and characters and arcs and all this stuff but i don't have to have it feel like when i put out an album i'm just like giving tabloids ammunition and stuff yeah there's so much judgment that would come along with every record yeah and constantly kind of like um examining yourself in a way that feels like i felt like there would be a point in my life where i could no longer really do that and and still maintain um a place of like good mental health and emotional health and all that so what i felt after we put out folklore was like oh wow people people are into this too this thing that feels i can do this for my life and feels really good for my creativity there's a way out too oh my god um i saw i saw elaine i saw elaine for my future that i i it was a real breakthrough moment of excitement and happiness and i kind of referred to writing these songs as a flotation device because um obviously this year is is hell on earth for everyone and seeing what your fellow humans are going through the long pawn studio sessions was the first time that jack aaron and i were in the same room and i still haven't been in the same room with justin vernon who has now collaborated on two albums heavily and we've talked but we're just we've just never been in the same space together it's pretty wild yeah how was that experience when you first caught up together and saw each other having made this amazing body of work because we saw it on camera there was this giddiness and this idea of like wow we did it we made it now we can celebrate it make it real to some degree but what was going on behind the camera that's what i think we all want to know is when you all first saw each other before the cameras rolled what was happening then because that's a truly human experience that i don't think you or anyone has ever been through before where the stakes were so high for remote recording and then you all come together and it's like wow how do we even translate this it was such a strange thing because we'd been on you know group chats and it just wasn't it wasn't ever the combination yet so the combination of the three of us was like this strange feeling of i remember i walked into the studio they were already rehearsing and i walked in and it was just like they were a band it didn't it wasn't that feeling of awkwardness between them because i guess they'd had their moment i walked in and i heard them playing august or something and i was just sitting there thinking this is exactly how i would have wanted it i would have wanted this you know reunion or union at all to happen in a moment of me walking in on them creating music and and rehearsing and playing instruments and and it just i just started rehearsing too and it was such a vibe um and it couldn't really have been i couldn't have asked for more under the circumstances you know it's so fun to make a record when you've got people in the room and you've got that energy that's bouncing off the walls but if you can't do that this was a pretty close second yeah i mean no one's been able to do that very rarely have people been able to get into a room and get that tactility and that chemistry that we all i guess to some degree became so accustomed to and you know i think about this year you talked about it and you you put it in the perfect framework um but it's also taught us a lot about stillness and what it is to be still and what it is to reflect and to be comfortable in our own skin and i think human beings by nature search for coping mechanisms and distractions to avoid that and in your case i've always felt that you've moved so fast and even if you've taken some time between projects it's clear you're working on things all the time you know what has this process of working on folklore and evermore busy year for you as a songwriter but also has it taught you something about stillness and has it altered your attitude toward pace and productivity and what motivates you yes it it has changed everything about the way that i do what i do um it gave me a perspective of you know i was i was pretty upset when my shows all got cancelled and i realized i wasn't going to be able to connect with my fans in the way that i'm traditionally used to um just a normal human interaction i couldn't do anymore you know especially after an album like lover which is just like such a communal joyous experience i can imagine it's like wow i'm going to get to bring this to life you know yeah and i think we all felt that way i think the fans felt that way too where we were we were just sitting there going wow that would have been that would i think that would have been fun um but what it did was you know when you plan a live show i guess at least when i do it i'm i'm writing interstitial music i'm planning um this set piece goes off while this goes on while we distract them over here and this this song calls for this and this song calls for that and that's all creating and i don't think i really assigned very much merit to the fact that that is creating when you're taking music you've already made and an album that you've already made and you're choreographing and you are set you're setting up a live spectacle that is taking up so much emotional creative and imaginary imagination based bandwidth in your brain so if you take all of that away what happens and and i guess i i learned that it's very possible for me to write more music with that creative bandwidth um as musicians we're so used to immediately touring immediately putting together the show immediately going into rehearsals and then we always feel that we need a pretty big break or at least a significant gap of time where we get to rest afterward and i guess i learned that when we're on the road it's not just that we're sweating and we're and we're meeting a million people and we're we have all this back and forth of of just energy of meeting this person getting us trying to get a surprise guest to surprise the crowd and and all this stuff that happens um on tour it's also the creation of the show itself that is taking up a lot of a lot of your your brain space so without that um this just happened naturally on its own is there a dysfunction to that do you think looking back on it now is there a correlation between some of the kind of more hard to manage parts of your life and the pace at which things go and and and how careers become the you know these kind of entities unto themselves yes and no i think that um looking back on my career there have been so many different musical phases and you know different things i wanted to wear at different times and they fit my life at the time and and so i think that you've got to allow yourself that grace to put on a certain lifestyle or a certain outfit or a certain creative uh mantra and then discard it when it when you outgrow it this is this was weird though because this evermore was the first time i didn't discard everything after i made something new you know it was weird i actually had to kind of fight off anxiety that i had in my head like fear that was like you need to change like like the demons are here like you need to change you can't you can't stay in the forest i was like i want to stay in the forest but the forest is such a weird place because when you're a kid and i think aesthetically that's a big part a significant part of what's made this so um immersive this experience is that that idea of stepping into the unknown and when you're a kid like this idea of wide open water is really scary not knowing what's underneath being out in the forest and looking directly into trees that could go on forever you know it's kind of an intimidating type of image and yet you made it feel like something that was intimate like you wanted to go into that how did that kind of relate to the music because it's such an essential part of these two albums the way that it looks and feels i think that working with aaron the music that we were making um he was writing instrumentals and i was writing the the melodies and the lyrics and what ended up happening was i think we just gravitated towards what both of us simultaneously felt made us feel cozy which was nature you know so many people during the pandemic just were going on hikes and trying to get outside because it was nature symbolized this strange comfort all of a sudden where um where we everything was completely off kilter and nobody could really figure out how to get their bearings and so we all went outside or we all tried to go camping or trying to go hiking or go on drives and it just i think that aaron's music and my music both reflected sort of that feel with aaron such an amazing instrumentalist and his his instrumentals that he was writing were all very um kind of dreamscapes and so it's not that this album is all about like the forest and the woods and stuff it's got hints of that and there's a lot of um kind of the lyric i one thing i wanted to do with folklore is i wanted it to represent spring and summer um and when i made evermore i knew that i wanted to fill in the rest of the seasons of the year and have it reflect fall and winter so that's another element that nature came into it but also it was the easiest way that we could do a photo shoot you know you can't you can't have i haven't had a haircut um by anyone except for myself since lockdown started and uh that's kind of how it's been you know like how can i make how can i make art and make visuals that go with this art where i i can't i can't ask my hair and makeup people and my stylist to quarantine for two weeks away from their families i'm not gonna ask them to do that like and and ask them to fly and and expose themselves to the virus so what how can i possibly make a cover on my own could i just sort of diy this um so i asked um you know i asked my friends if i could use their field and their woods and um i used a photographer who works alone she doesn't have assistance she shoots on film so we were carrying bags of film out in fields and i'd be like you know touching up my like my lipstick and and then i'd run out into a field and she'd take pictures it was it was really fun honestly i'm gonna say you know it must have been really amazing as a songwriter too i was thinking about these two albums in relation to your career and how in a weird way and i don't mean this in any relation to the in any negative reaction to your previous albums because you know how i feel but the process itself of writing songs from a very pure place with no plans because you make your debut album with nothing but ambition that's a plan that's a big plan and then from there the plans start to increase and get bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and to your point you're looking for the next plan i just don't feel like there were any plans here did it did it feel like you could get to a pure place this year without all those yes it did pure is a really really perfect word for that um because what happens to you as your career builds and builds and builds and builds is that if you've accomplished a thing in the past all of a sudden you're you're expected to accomplish that thing plus another new thing plus this other thing over here there it becomes sort of like i had felt at times when i felt a lot of pressure i had felt like i was doing some sort of like obstacle course um and and that's not how you should feel when you're creating you know you shouldn't feel like i need to make a track list where this one's for the stadium show this one's for radio this one's for people who want to get in their feelings check check check and you can end up doing you can end up doing that um and it's good to have friends who are artists who have similar pressures like like ed sheeran and i talk about this a great deal this was a time when we both stepped back and i would say to him this is the first time i felt like i threw the checklist away like i threw it away and i definitely could have gone into the pandemic thinking i've got to wait for everything to open up so i can do things exactly the way that i am used to doing them but then about three days in i thought wait this could be an opportunity to for me to do things in a way i haven't ever done them before what would my work sound like if i took away all of my fear-based checklisting that i have inflicted on myself wow so i guess you know the answer now yeah to me there's an interesting correlation here between these two albums and this idea of getting into a pure space the freedom and the space space being another key word to this um and the idea of going back and and re-recording your music do you see a correlation between reflecting the person you've been and becoming the person you wanted that you are and are going to be wow there's a lot to unpack there um but it does resonate with me a lot because i was i was allowed to start re-recording my music in november by then we had a great deal of evermore um done i i had shot a music video for willow but i was still writing and i was still recording so there would be days where i'd be recording um i'd be recording you belong with me and then i'd be recording a song like happiness which is on evermore and wow it made me feel really proud of sort of um the scope of things and looking back when i was a teenager and i would write about you know my my troubles in high school and the drama and the pining away and all that stuff that was all so valid to me at that time in my life just as much as evermore is so valid to to my happiness at this time in my life um so it's been really i've really felt very grateful lately for people giving me the ability to grow up creatively and i know there have been snags and there have been times where people have been like i don't like her several times but for the most part i feel a great amount of gratitude that i was able to make music from the time i was a teenager to the time that i'm 31. and normally you know you you put those songs out and then you have to let them go and even when you perform them in front of people they i often feel like they they belong more to the fans and to the audience sometimes than they even do to the artists you know and getting a chance to re-record them for whatever reason whatever whatever prompted this thing the fact that you get to go and listen to these and re-record them i wonder if it may if it brings you closer to them and changes your feelings towards songs that often people just record and move on from don't even listen to again as artists unless they're playing them yes it does it makes me feel really close to those songs again and it also reminds me that obviously i want to keep a lot of cool surprises for the fans until i'm ready to show them fully to everyone but the reason that i feel so passionately that artists should own their catalogs is because if you are the creator of all of this music you're the only one who actually knows the ins and the outs of it you're the only one who knows what almost was written you're the only one who knows the kind of secrets of the journey of making this music so you're actually the only one who has the ability to share it with the fans in the way that that um can make everyone the happiest and the most excited so it's been it's been really fulfilling in a way that i i had no idea what to expect you don't want to feel like it's um like you know your homework got destroyed and so now you have to redo your homework it's not like that at all yeah it's yeah it's not like you gotta go into it like this is an opportunity and also you know you talked about artists owning their catalogue and i i've been talking to artists for most of my life and there's one thing that continues to crop up and i think that you know your perspective would be really really interesting here which is why do you think that as artists we put security and stability before artistic control and freedom as young artists we don't make that conscious decision we aren't given the information often times and that's why i'm having lots of conversations behind the scenes with record labels and trying to help them understand this from from a psychological perspective what you do to an artist when you separate them from their work you break something and and i'm trying to figure out how to put that thing back together in a way that heals what was broken by a system that is not designed for artists to um have have a chance at you know a that's a that's an artist pension plan that's their retirement that's their legacy that's what they want to leave to their children and how could you ever know how could you ever know the life you're going to live how could you ever know what's going to happen right a coming of age has come and gone right how could you ever know that yeah good quote but yeah i was i was a i was 15 14 when i was in record deal talks record deal negotiations so you can't really go back and say wow this was a what a conscious choice that was made you just you don't know um the music industry until you know it and and because i have learned what i've learned i really just want to make things better for other people and i want that to start at the at the record deal in the contract artists should never have to part with their work they should they should own it from day one but they should license it back to the label so that the label can make back their money over a certain amount of time and that that amount of time should be what's negotiated upon it should not be a question moving forward and and if i can if i can do anything to change that for a young artist in the future or many or all of them then that's you know i'm gonna keep keep being loud about it it's an incredible observation at a brilliant age to come to come to that um and at the time of recording your birthdays in a couple of days by the time this is seen it's probably about 24 hours ago to protect myself from the swifties i gotta say happy birthday even though you haven't had your birthday it's a very delorean kind of nightmare for me right now i mean so back to the future vortex but anyway happy birthday thank you i wanted to talk about this album and the word i mentioned at the beginning closure is is something that keeps coming up on evermore for me as a listener and a fan of your music but it's got to start somewhere the album and the journey has to start somewhere and it starts with willow and it's i don't i don't often ask this question i wish i did why is that the first song on the album and you're the artist to ask it to taylor because it's definitely a reason i liked opening the album with that because i loved the feeling that i got immediately upon hearing the instrumental that aaron created for it it felt strangely i i say witchy and i stand by that it felt like somebody's standing over a potion making a love potion dreaming up the person that they want and the person they desire and trying to figure out how to get that person in their life and all the kind of misdirection and bait and switch and comp like complexity that goes into seeing someone feeling a connection wanting them and trying to make them a part of your life it's um it it's tactical at times it's confusing at times to fate it's magic it's called manifestation that's how human beings actually make sense of it it's we're manifesting but it's something else it's something else yeah it's a cold combination of all of it yeah it felt it felt a bit magical and mysterious which is what i wanted people to feel going into an album that was a collection of these stories um that were going to take them in all kinds of directions so i wanted to start them with sort of a setting of the vibe but what you say about closure is really really profound because with folklore i one of the main themes throughout that was conflict resolution right like trying to figure out how to get through something with someone or making confessions or trying to tell them something trying to communicate with them evermore deals a lot in endings of all sorts shapes and sizes all the kinds of ways we can end a relationship a friendship um something toxic and and and the pain that goes along with that the phases of it um so it's cool that you notice that i mean it opens up so many possibilities for you as a writer once you know you get to a point where you feel you don't have to stick to that linear narrative and it's it's a very brilliant narrative but the idea of like i love you we fell out we broke up you know there's pain there's there's joy when you start to look at all the other open endings and you go deeper and it requires some real character analysis and development in order to do that successfully because you can't have lived all those lives but you might have learned a thing or two about your own by doing so have there been moments during writing of these albums where you've learned things about yourself that you would never have learned if you'd been focused on that specific emotional feeling absolutely absolutely because um when you watch a film or you read a book and there's a character that you identify with you most of the time identify with them because they're they're targeting something in you that feels that you've been there um you re that's why we relate to characters and so um when i'm when i was reading you know rebecca by daphne de mourier and i was thinking um wow her husband just tolerates her she's she's doing all these things and she's trying so hard and she's trying to impress him and he's just tolerating her the whole time there was a part of me that was you know relating to that because at some point in my life i felt that way and so i ended up writing this song tolerate it that's all about sort of truth trying to love someone who's ambivalent thank you it's unreal thank you so much and i mean even a song like champagne problems all right let's talk about that there's unrequited love that's a well written topic in in the art of in the arts but then there's that song that song that is one of the most heartbreaking tales of unrequited love i've ever heard in my entire life and it should have been written by somebody who is honestly and obviously very much in love so i don't know how you got there well joe and i really love sad songs we've always bonded over music so it was clearly you've written some of the saddest songs of your career together songs we just really love sad songs what can i say um he he started that one and came up with the uh melodic structure of it and um i say it was a surprise that we started writing together but in a way it wasn't because we have always bonded over music and had the same musical tastes and he's always the person who's showing me songs by by artists and i'm then then they become my favorite songs or whatever but um yeah champagne problems was that was one of my favorite bridges to write i really love um a bridge where you tell the full story in the bridge like you really like you shift gears in that bridge i'm so excited to one day be in front of a crowd when they all sing she would have made such a lovely bride what a shame she's in the head like it's broken i know it's so sad i know it's so sad but it's those songs like all too well performing the song all too well is one of the most joyful experiences i ever go through when i perform live so when there's a song like champagne problems where you know it's so sad you know that but i i i love a sad song you know what's it like when you're walking through the house and you hear the piano being played and music being written and maybe for the first time ever it's not you yes someone else well he doesn't think of it that way you know he's always just playing instruments and he doesn't do it in a strategic i'm writing a song right now thing he's always done that but i do i think we would have taken the step of hey let's see if there's an there's a song in here let's write a song together if we hadn't been in lockdown uh i don't think that would have happened and i'm so glad that it did he's been a part of some of the most sort of powerful moments on these records in terms of song exile is no joke like that song is a serious serious moment and another seriously sad it is it is we're so proud of that one um also because i i do remember the exact moment that i walked in and he was playing that exact piano part um and all i had to do was follow the piano melody with the verse melody so because the vocal melody is exactly the same pretty much it's mirrored with the piano part that he wrote and we did the same thing with evermore where i'll just kind of hear what he's doing and it's exactly it's all there all i have to do is dream up some lyrics and come up with some gut-wrenching heart-shattering story to to write with him so here's the question then you're joe and you and you play music because you love it and you have passions in the arts in all kinds of places and i would ask him this if i saw him but i can't so i'll ask you then you come up with a song like exile and justin vernon is singing it with you has he expressed to you how that feels for him to just be expressing himself the next thing you know bonnie ver and yourself are bringing this song to life because you always wanted that in your life but for him it's just been this organic thing folklore and evermore include our favorite artists so it's you know we've always listened to bunny bear the national so it's a big deal for you it's a huge deal and you've probably been trying to pluck up the courage to get into the studio with justin vernon subconsciously or consciously for a long time but for him it's like how does this happen i never would have imagined that justin would be would dive into this project or any project with me like this because justin has his own musical world and his own sort of in my mind it was this impenetrable force field of brilliance that he he cultivates talent from everywhere he he operates out of eau claire i i never knew how i would ever get in contact with justin vernon my in was that aaron desner who produced these albums and wrote with me um is his best friend i mean they are like they have a connection they would do anything for each other like they would do anything to support each other's projects it's really really sweet and pure and lovely their their love and ex and uh respect for each other so he said to me when i when i sent him exile um he said to me i think i think justin would be into this i think he would be into this and i said i said this will break my heart if he doesn't want to because my biggest anxieties say to me the artist that you love will never will never love you too so so um it was just a really huge moment just all around all around really good moment when he wanted to be a part of it and then he when we went in to make evermore what shocked me too was that justin leaned in you know he's playing the lead guitar solo on cowboy like me he's playing the drums on that song he's playing drums on closure he's singing background vocals on ivy and marjorie sorry i didn't know i had a home phone but apparently until somebody called it you probably didn't even know your number it's actually really good to learn that today um but but justin vernon working so um just so naturally and so enthusiastically on evermore was a really cool turn of events because i feel truly truly honored um and i can't wait to meet him yeah it's so weird i know it's so weird but you know perfectly perfectly in keeping with this year okay yeah so here's a question up until this year even through your collaborative stages and you've been working with jack now for a while and you have a really strong group of artists and friends around you all the time but there's always the sense that it's taylor's vision taylor's on track you're in control you've got this this idea of you having to kind of forge ahead on your own terms and here you are on a song like exile with your significant other involved in the creative process and your hero involved in the creative process i was listening to that song and i thought well you must have fought protected you must have actually felt really wrapped up in that moment and and was it emotional and did it did that resonate with you that like wow like i'm good i actually don't think that i believed that this song would exist in the world because in my head that doesn't that wasn't going to happen i'd never wanted to get too invested in it because i always wanted justin to be able to say at the last minute hey i don't want to be on the record you know and i wanted that to be okay with me you know so i actually did not assign too much i didn't fuse myself to the idea that this was real until the album was actually out and i remember just like going on drives and listening to exile thinking oh it happened this song got made it got finished it got put out into the world and we're all happy about it and people are listening to it like it was sort of i don't mind i don't mean to seem so like aw shucks about it but it really i didn't want to get my heart broken you know people can change their minds about things i get it but then when he goes so step right out and he gets he does that justin vernon thing that was that was the moment because he when he added that part that was the moment that sent me into the universe with without any chance of returning um because he he we had written up to that point and he added that and so when we got the recording back we had no idea what he was going to do and when we heard that part it was just like hands on face face is melting everything is everything is made out of confetti it's a beautiful way to put it um yeah one story that that that really stood out um when we were watching the long pond sessions was the one about august and the idea of that song coming from that line meet me behind the mall and that you'd had that line for a long time how long had you had that line for uh it was about six months old probably you're collecting ideas and things all the time right i mean you've got to be just absorbing and drawing inspiration and writing jutting and and and ideating um how do you sort of catalog and how do you make sense of that and do you draw upon those things often do you reflect into your own space to create something new yes whenever i because i really love um a turn of a phrase or play on words or common phrases and you twist something um another one that i had for a very long time i think i'd had this one for a couple of years was um the knife cuts both ways if the shoe fits walk in it till your high heels break those are my favorite kind of things to do so if i think of one but i don't have a song at the moment i write it down and and i keep a file of um i also have a folder of favorite words so it's i have favorite phrases favorite words favorite lines that i think could just fit somewhere what are some of your favorite words top of your head oh top of my head well epiphany on on folklore was it was one of my favorite words um incandescent which is on the the song um ivy um that's one that i really like just sort of the ones that sound pretty when you say them and and they also mean something that's interesting um the fans have a really amazing inside joke where they they're like what like the the starter kit for listening to folklore evermore and it's just a picture of a dictionary like like they're like they're like taylor we needed to look up 300 different words it is like taylor swift bingo it's like bingo we got that one in there that's great no it all adds up to as i said at the beginning of our conversation it's kind of really immersive world and you use geography a lot on these two albums too you know coney island being a very very visceral image i've been there i know what you're referring to when you go there the idea of that very foggy lonely the you know the fairground ride is shut down the whole thing feels like the end of a golden era um and matt bernie bernage's uh burning his uh verse on that is just unbelievable but he didn't write it right yeah i was writing it as if i were matt so wow you did a great job what's the line in here what's the line in there do you miss the rogue who coaxed you into paradise and left you there will you forgive my soul when you're too wise to trust and too old to care okay so what's it like when you're inside how do you like that one that just that one was i'm a huge fan of the national i love the way they do that sort of downbeat sometimes self-loathing reflective just cut right to the heart of the matter um that lyricism it you know it's why i'm such a fan of the band and when we had an idea that that matt could could sound really amazing on this um that was kind of the perspective i was coming from was like a male a male perspective of regret or guilt after life after a lifetime of of um of a pattern of behavior um and i've been kind of touching on sort of things like that on the song tolerate it where there's this you know person who's on one side of the relationship who's felt like they've just their partner's been there but they haven't been there they've been there but they're just sitting next to each other eating breakfast they haven't they haven't been there so writing matt's part was really fun i really loved writing we were like the mall before the internet it was the one place to be like it was it was the place to be and i was trying to reflect on the coney island visual of a place where thrills were once sought you know a place where once it was all electricity and magic and um now the lights are out and and you're looking at it thinking what did i do i also really liked having him say happy birthday in the song were you standing in the hallway with a big cake happy birthday and i knew i was gonna release it on my birthday week so a little personal birthday wish from matt burning if you on your birthday nobody's great i actually got my favorite lead singer of my favorite band to wish me happy birthday so that's the real win you talk about tolerate it you talk about nobody no crime loyalty the idea of being loyal to your own emotions also loyalty being i would say based on what we know about you being it's something that's very important to you that loyalty is an incredibly important character trait to you probably the most important character trait yeah it requires some tough conversations and and i think about a song like tolerate it and we've all seen our friends go through this continue to stay in situations where it's not good for their health and they can't see it are you the kind of person that's capable to do that out of loyalty to speak to your friends and say look you know this isn't working for you i think that it's probably not my place to say that unless they come to me and confide in me and say you know i need to vent i need to talk you have to kind of give people the space to learn lessons in their own time i've learned that you know the messenger often gets shot and if you talk a bunch of about your friend's boyfriend like they're definitely going to get back together and then you're the one who who they they form a united front and you're the one that's on on the outside of it so i try really hard to just kind of be patient and listen to friends and if they want to talk we talk and but it's it's you have to know that people are going to make decisions based on their heart and their feelings and and like if that doesn't match up with the way that you see the situation objectively you've gotta you've gotta take it take it as a case-by-case situation and just try to be a good friend because we're all human and we're all kind of learning lessons at in the weirdest time facing humankind 2020. true true the song happiness again one of the best best songs on evermore and there's a great line in there where you talk a little bit about not being ready to reinvent yourself yet you're not there you haven't identified who you need to become i i i guess you're just really content in this place and then with i just applied it to the songwriting process into where you were at your life you said you woke up feeling like this was coming to an end to some degree this morning do you feel like the world is now starting to catch up to you again and that this wonderful kind of magical moment is going to change shape well that's that's very perceptive of you because that that song was the last song that i wrote on evermore so i think that line specifically was i haven't i haven't met the new me yet in the context of the relationship song i was writing i was trying to channel sort of my friends who have gotten out of very very long impactful life-altering relationships and saying how do i pack this up how do i put this in a box and put it in my car and drive away um and what did i leave there so from from that perspective it goes to i haven't met the new me yet you know the person i'm gonna have to become in order to get over this this person who's gonna have to have new hobbies and fill their time with new things other than you in the second verse it says i hope she'll be a beautiful fool who takes my spot next to you and i i have you haven't met the new me yet meaning you haven't met the person who's going to replace me yet but i know you're going to so then in the third verse it goes to i haven't met the new me yet but i think she'll give you that meaning i think she's going to forgive you and i think she's going to give you that green light to move ahead with your life and to know that i'm okay but in my in my there's another meaning to the phrase which is that i have no idea what comes after this and i truly truly have no plan and i'm okay with that it does feel like this is it for a bit um but i don't know what that means and i don't know it's it's exactly the phrase is exactly what i mean i have no idea what happens next there's a couple of songs on this album that take us into your family history that prove not only to be fantastic stories but clearly very personal very emotional and just beautifully told and one of those is called margaery which is you know for anyone who has lost a member of their family and felt like there was something unresolved in terms of wisdom or experience or time spent because we take time for granted we really do as people until it's too late or we lose it what was the experience like writing that song the experience writing that song was really surreal because you know i i was kind of a wreck at times writing it i'd sort of break down sometimes um it was really hard to actually even sing it in the vocal booth without sounding like i had sort of a a break because it just was really emotional i think that one of the hardest forms of regret to sort of work through is the regret of being so young when you lost someone that you didn't have the perspective to learn and appreciate who they were fully you know you didn't have that that sort of you know i'd open up my grandmother's closet and she had beautiful dresses from the 60s i wish i'd asked her where she wore every single one of them yeah so things like that she was a singer and and she my mom will look at me so many times a year and say god you just you're just like her when i'll do you know some mannerism that i don't recognize as being anyone other than mine and it's really hard that that thing because parents they hand that down to you as a gift that's a very common thing to say about family members it's ultimately a gift it's like you remind me of your your you know your grandmother whatever but what it does is it continues to pique your interest in why i can't get an answer why really because they're not here for me to find that out you know yeah yeah she she died when i was 13 and um she died almost i think it was when i was on a trip to nashville to try and make it and to try to hand out my demo cd to record labels and things like that so there were pretty insane coincidences like that and um you know i've always felt that thing like i've always just sort of felt like like she was seeing um seeing seeing this you know because we have to sort of do that but one of the things about this song that kind of um still rips me apart when i listen to it is that she's singing with me on this song how did that happen my mom found a bunch of her old records a bunch of old vinyls of her singing opera and i sent them to aaron and he added them to the song and so it says you know if i didn't know better i think you were singing to me now and then you hear her you hear marjorie actually saying my grandmother and it just it's it's moments like that on the record that just make you feel like your whole heart is in this whole thing that you're doing it's it's all of you that you put into these things memories are a significant part of this this body of work the idea of memories and what they mean to you and also as we said the beginning closure to create new ones you know and you talked about you talked about time and coincidence and things the biggest mischief conception about you we spoke about this last time we spoke was that there's this controlling side to you there's a difference between ambition or wanting to do something right in control but my point is that is that you actually your life is filled with coincidence it's filled with fate it's filled with timing isn't it yes and never more so than with the process of these two albums honestly this is one of those things where i kind of had to just sort of throw out any playbook i had you know i you you just in times like these when everything is uncertain and everything changes in your world i guess i just sort of took it as an opportunity to embrace the fact that even if you think you have control in normal times that's an illusion if you're making stuff put it out if people need music and you've made music put it out you know there was a time in the beginning of the process where i was like i will wait till january when things are looking more normal then i will put out folklore and i was like that's my old brain that's my old brain thinking that there's any way that i can control this and you know humans do need to have some sort of strategy when they go into putting out you know music or doing any business whatsoever but as much as that has an ability to fall by the wayside it did with this because there was no way to make it and feel in control you can't you've got to just let fate do what it's going to do with something like this and and i do talk to aaron and jack about this a lot because we do feel sort of like this was a whirlwind we don't understand it our logical brains don't comprehend it um and we know it's you know you guys make albums of course you put out albums all the time whatever but this this feels different for us it does it feels like something that will affect our the rest of our lives um and the way that we make art and and not being too precious we we actually really weren't very precious about this we we weren't too picky or or oh it has to be everything has to be perfect it's like no uh nothing's going to be perfect right now let's make music that yeah how does it feel and um i'm so happy that people welcomed it into their lives the way that they did so if the album has to start with willow it has to end somewhere and it ends with evermore and a lot has already been made because your fans we are so engaged in your writing and the themes and the narrative of that particular song but you wrote it and i'd love to know why it ends these you know this body of work well there were there were sort of a double meaning to the months that are mentioned and the feelings that are mentioned um one of the meanings is that um we were i wrote this song and these lyrics when uh we were coming up to the election and i didn't know what was going to happen um so almost i was almost preparing for the worst to happen and trying to see some sort of glimmer at the at the at the end of the tunnel and and the last verse you know the song is it goes through walking through the forest barefoot in the middle of winter or standing on a balcony and letting the icy wind just hit you and you're catching your death and and then in the last course the person goes inside and finally is warm and finally is safe it's about sort of um the process of finding hope again but it also reflected back to um an experience that i had that was pretty life altering when i went through like a bunch of bad stuff in 2016 like july november all those times were just sort of taking it day by day to get through trying to find some trying to find a glimmer of hope all of that so i was coming from both of those perspectives and we wrote it exactly the same way we did exile where joe wrote the piano i based the vocal melody on the piano and we sent it to justin who then added that bridge it and joe had written the piano part so that it the tempo speeds up and it changes the music completely changes to a different tempo in the bridge and justin really latched on to that and just a hundred percent embraced it and wrote this beautiful sort of the clutter the clutter of all your anxieties in your head and they're all speaking at once and i we got the bridge back and then i wrote this narrative of um when i was shipwrecked i thought of you you know that sort of thing where there was this beacon of hope and then in the end you realize the pain wouldn't be forever that it you know it could get better so that was why i wanted to end it there but we also have two bonus tracks that are coming out um that are a second ending which i'm excited about i know you love a second ending taylor which we all do as well i love that um well i gotta ask i gotta ask this question because at some point the the hope is that the doors open up again and we get to experience this as a community and we get to see perform and and put on these amazing shows and there's something really beautiful about these these two albums existing in their own skin and not having to put on costumes every night but there's obviously going to be a desire i'm sure to play them and it definitely is for us to hear them you've got these this amazing team around you these players these collaborators can you see a time when you could you could pull this family together and go and play some shows even just a select group of shows wow that is one of our day dreams that we talk about often but it's not a plan the conversations happen between me erin and jack and doing doing the long pawn studio sessions it just made us want to play music like that more it just made us want to um you know start a band together um and justin i know talks to aaron about it a lot too about just like we've gotta we've gotta play together we've gotta play this music together because we've loved singing it i was actually talking to marcus mumford about it too because he sang backup vocals on cowboy like me and he was like we gotta we gotta have a band we've gotta do this so i think everybody who's involved you know the the heim girls are my best friends and we have it's weird we always end up at parties where there's a stage and people are like go play something play something and so we've played live together so many times we've been on tour together but this is actually the first album where esti alana danielle and i have actually collaborated on a song and so you know these are all people i love that's the reason why the daydream feels very feasible because i i would play with these people forever what do you play with heim at parties i gotta ask because i'm friends with them as well what do you play with i'm at parties what do you play do you play covers what do you play well when we were at um the snl 40th anniversary party they had a band up there on stage and uh jimmy fallon had the mic and he was like somebody's gotta get up and play and so um he saw us in the crowd pointed at us and i was like i think it was established that shake it off as three chords over and over and over again so i was just like i was like a minor cg um uh and and so you know we played then we've also done like we had a party once where we would um where we were the house band and we would just like if somebody wanted to sing karaoke we would just really quick chart out the song and play whatever song they wanted to and it was like a karaoke machine so we've had a lot of fun what was the worst cover that you did that night when you guys couldn't chart it out and it just fell apart at the seams um it wasn't bad in the sense that we didn't know the song but we did do like sort of a disco version of under the sea by from the little mermaid that i think is would be filed as one of the least expected ones from the evening um so much closure now and and you yourself said you woke up this morning feeling this i can't remember what word you used but you used a brilliant way to describe it can you remember how you described how you felt this morning when you woke up it was like either serenity or or like relief or conclusion or serenity is a great one relief conclusion they're all great ones so the last the last question for now is if the last decade was just success and pace and controversy and and irrelevant you know tumultuousness and all this stuff wrapped up in into it into a decade right what is what does it feel like looking forward now that you've had this year to be able to collect your thoughts put them into music and and and come through the end of this year looking forward what does it feel like i have absolutely no idea what uh the next decade holds and i think that's kind of something i'm going to keep i'm going to keep that like it is because i was always such a planner and such a such a list maker and lists of dreams and goals and things i wanted to do and i think my new list will be like places i want to see in the world adventures i want to have experiences i want to have things i want to learn um i think that'll be what the list looks like because you know there's always going to be a list it's me you know but it'll be lists of in quarantine my list uh was i decided to start trying to cook everything that i had always loved to eat but never been able to cook so there's always a list it's been great to uh to connect with you on this a sincere congratulations from everyone at apple music and everyone who subscribes who loves your music and streams your music and you know we're so excited for what's to come but right now just to live in this in this moment for you to be the apple music songwriter of the year is so richly deserved and we're really happy i'm really grateful and i'm so thankful to everyone who listens and and also everybody um just on your platform who is so creative and and believes in artists and lifts us up and supports us and that includes you so thank you so much um for everything and for always being a good friend and a great person to talk to and a great person uh who listens i know you've heard all this a million times because everyone loves you but i hope you have a really great holiday season and and um it's much appreciated thank you taylor be safe be well have a great holiday and uh to the future thank you bye you These are apple balloons. A lovely idea
from America. They sell them as bird bodies,  but I call them apples. You
blow them up a very small amount, no more than this, and then you've got to
tie up the end; then what you've got to do is you've got to push this end here
right through to the far side, right through the centre of the balloon,  all the way up to the top end; and then when it's
in the top end you push it a little way into that stem which is a thicker
bit of rubber and withdraw the stick. So it's now going all the way through. Lots and lots of winding up,  you've got to get it nice and tight, so it is going to hold when
you release it, and then push this in, a long long way like that. With any luck you end up an apple. What a lovely idea. Good enough to eat isn't it? I must have a bite....

are getting themselves a mac But to them it's not an
average computer like a PC No to them, Apple is a religious matter They get their mac, and then straight up they all start making
the same kind of remarks Well actually, Apple is
mostly about labeling When you open the box, the
thing is highly refined, So well thought out Hyper classy My macbook for instance, I kept the box and hung it in my living room Cassiopée! Any nespresso left? All these dudes going to Apple stores can't seem to just settle for a computer All of a sudden they get an iMac, then an Iphone that matches it They know everything about Apple products which haven’t even came out yet but which will in a year They breathe Apple They Eat Apple They pooh Apple And they utterly despise
anybody who doesn't use macs For example, to them a
PC dude looks like this You wanna play some Call Of Dudy? Call of...  dudy? You know, some Call of.. And when it comes to Linux users... Here! Come with us,  join us, we're already 11! Come on Come it's comfy Look at all the things we can do! And what's funny is that since
macs are extremely expensive guys who own one can't
help to justify themselves in order to prove that they really need it Owning a mac is an absolute necessity Professionally speaking I can't
figure out how I could do otherwise No it really isn't a mindful purchase But a real professional choice WRONG So according to them when you got a PC you might be able to do some word processing Some games too! Like... Like call of dudy! and still, you ought to have a War Machine So maybe you can only word process on a PC but at least it's widely accessible I mean, have you seen the price of a mac? The slightest accessory costs a rent Hi, I'd like to buy the
keyboard... the apple one official, bluetooth enabled please It'll be *** euros sir No no I'm just taking the keyboard I was indeed referring to the
separately sold keyboard sir I guess I'll just take
the "E" key then... yeah And what bothers me the most about
those Apple products users is that when they use their stuff next to you they give you a demo just
as if it was a commercial Who are you calling? My Voice-Mail You're calling your voice mail?! Because on the iPhone, voicemails
go straight to your phone... it's really handy Having troubles with that? Yeah, a bit Me, my macbook Air is almost
as thick as a paper sheet It perfectly fits in my backpack
and follows me everywhere I go Oh so you're writing on a notebook? yeah Because me on my Iphone Hello? I ran out of battery Even at the end of their mails you can see "Sent from my iPhone" Seriously that sentence is
just made to brag right? Because when you're writing a mail on a
washed out PC from a sloppy network room, generally speaking, you don't precise it Sent from a washed out PC, in a sloppy network room on a shitty-ass computer. See you soon, I hope that
we'll be able to sleep together Damn' Oh yeah by the way : Siri what's the deal with that? you're talking to your
phone in front of everybody who then has access to your intimacy
because you have to talk out loud?! Send my wife a message telling her that I can't wait to get back
home tonight and lick her tits Evening... Evening! It doesn't make any sense Since when do you grant everyone
access to your intimacy ? What are you saying Norman? Nothing, I was checking my lessons It's been at least 4 years
since you quit being a student Yeah... Yeah sure but these are
old lessons which I just wanted to check back for fun...
that's called "education" When Steve Jobs CEO of
Apple died a few months ago Millions of people read the dude's biography I'm okay if it's about a famous writer,
a politician or something like that But since when does one
read the biography of a CEO? What are you reading? The biography of the CEO of Carrefour Markets Yeah since I was always shopping there I feel kinda concerned Let's not forget that he is the one who
invented the self-service cheese departments Each person who has at least
once made their groceries at a Carrefour market must read it... It's a treat If it ticks you off too, you can
share that video on your facebook wall And if you want you can also join my
facebook page "normanfaitdesvideos" the only one out there See you soon! oh shit oh it's okay I got a spare keyboard ♪ Upbeat percussion music ♪ ♪ ♪ the seasons of Arnold's apple tree by Gayle Gibbons Arnold climbs up high into the branches of the apple tree he can see far far away in every direction this is Arnold's very own special place this is Arnold's apple tree Arnold's tree keeps him very busy all through the year it is spring Arnold watches the small buds grow on his apple tree some of the buds develop into sweet-smelling apple blossoms carefully and quietly Arnold watches bees collect nectar from the blossoms to make honey Arnold makes a swing for his apple tree he weaves an apple blossom wreath and hangs it from a branch Arnel picks an armful of apple blossoms and brings it to his family they make and a flower arrangement together it is summer bernal's apple tree has big green leaves that rustle in the wind Arnold bills a treehouse his apple tree shades him from the hot Summer Sun the green leaves shelter him during a summer shower Arnold watches small apples begin to grow from where the blossoms used to be they grow bigger bigger and bigger with some of the big green apples Arnold does a juggling act for his tree friend it is fall arnold's apple tree now has big tasty red apples the green leaves have turned golden they drift to the ground Arnold gather some of the leaves and brings them to his tree house to make a soft lure to lie on Arnold shakes the branches and red apples fall to the ground he puts them in a basket and takes them home Arnold and his family make apple pies with apples from Arnold's apple tree they put the rest of the apples into a cider press and make fresh apple cider on Halloween day Arnold decorates some of the biggest apples they glow in the moonlight under his tree on Halloween night it is winter snow falls it is quiet the branches of Arnold's apple tree are bare Arnold hang strings of popcorn and berries on them for the winter birds to eat he builds a snow fort around the bottom of his tree Arnold build a snowman to keep him and his tree company during the winter the snow melts away and it is spring again [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] hi audio geeks welcome back to the channel it's great to see you all now this has been a really exciting week for apple fanboys like me and audiophiles also like me because apple music has finally launched in a lossless streaming tier and the best bit about it is that it costs no more than the standard apple music streaming so that makes a refreshing change however it isn't exactly obvious how to listen to apple lossless streaming across all your devices so i thought it'd be useful to do a quick video showing you how to get the best out of it and it's a little bit different depending on whether using a mac or an idevice i.e an ipad or an iphone as of yet the lossless streaming doesn't seem to be activated in the android app of apple music i believe it's coming but it's certainly not available to me anyway at the moment so let's look at ios devices first i'm using an ipad but the situation is pretty similar on an iphone except for the fact that you've got a lightning port rather than the usb-c port as we'll see as we go along so first of all you need to turn on the lossless streaming in settings so if you go into settings into music uh amongst all the usual stuff you will see new options now we're not going to be talking about dolby atmos today i know a lot of people are excited about spatial audio i must admit i find it pretty underwhelming personally i don't find the quality great i think it's a bit gimmicky i will do another video about it if you want me to so you should have some new options as long as your server has been updated so if you click onto this audio quality button here you will see an option to toggle on and off lossless audio so let's turn it on and then you get to choose under what circumstances you want to stream lossless audio so if you're on an iphone for example and you're using mobile data you might not want to stream lossless if you're constrained with regard to your data limit i've left mine on aac mainly because i'm out and about i'm not really going to hear the difference not even convinced i'm going to hear the difference at home to be honest but that's a story for another video which you can go and watch but for the sake of this video let's turn on uh the highest quality wi-fi streaming and you've got two options either lossless or high resolution losses now apple are calling lossless uh up to 24-bit 48 kilohertz files and then high-res anything above that and the maximum at the moment is 192 kilohertz and as you can see the file sizes get significantly larger as the bitrate and sample rate goes up as you'd expect so let's go for the highest setting okay high resolution to stream and high resolution to download right that's all done so let's dive into apple music then here it is don't laugh at my recently listened uh albums and stuff tastes differ you know so right first thing to say is that if you're listening using airpods or airpod pros that i've got here or even the brand new app on max's you might as well not have turned the lossless streaming off because it's not possible to transmit lossless streams via bluetooth to airpod devices or third-party bluetooth devices for that matter so if you're going to be listening with airpods just stick to aac and save yourself a lot of data and hassle so to listen to the lossless tiers you need wired headphones but obviously modern ipads and modern iphones don't have headphone jacks so this is where it gets a bit complicated so if you just want to listen to the standard lossless that is up to 48 kilohertz sample rate files you can do that with one of apple's own dongle adapters so for the ipad here it's an ipad pro so i need a usbc to 3.5 mil adapter and that plugs in nice and easy into the usbc port and then obviously pop your headphones in there and if you do that you will be listening to up to 24 bit 48 kilohertz files uh losslessly because that is the maximum resolution that's supported by these dongles this by the way you've seen it in my other videos one of my favorite bits of tech but this is just the apple lightning to us uh sorry lightning to 3.5 mil dongle and it too supports up to 24 bit 48 kilohertz so that's all well and good and if you listen through those you'll you'll get that standard lossless tier so i'll show you that so if we jump into lucy dakis's album here now you can tell in the new version of software whether an album is available in lossless because you get this little logo here the three lines and lossless and then if you click on a song and you open up the album view once again you get that little badge in the now playing screen and more than that if you click on that it'll tell you what the actual bitrate and sample rate of the song was playing is so in this case 24 bit 44.1 kilohertz and that is what i'll be getting through the dongle because it can handle it okay so that's nice and easy however the dongle does not handle high-res i.e above 48 kilohertz audio neither does the lightning one so for that you'll need an external dac so just as well i've got one handy and this in fact is the fio btr5 which you'll have seen one of my other videos now obviously it won't stream uh in a lackluster see if you're just connected by bluetooth hence currently it's going to aac so you need to plug it in and the reason i've chosen this one is that with the ipad pro anyways it's got usbc connector as has the ipad pro so it's a simple matter to wire it up so here's a usbc to usbc cable one end in the ipad pro one end in the dac and straight away you can see it's switched to wired mode so now let's try playing the lucy dakis album again and remember we said this was 44.1 kilohertz and sure enough that is brilliant it's picked up the correct sample rate and it's playing nicely super duper now then let's try playing a more high-res um album so for example abbey road by the beatles i think this is a 2019 remaster and here you see it says it's available in high res lossless and if we load up a track so classic john lennon come together and we go to high res losses there so this one's actually 24 bit 96 kilohertz so not the full 192. so hopefully if we fire up the btr5 hopefully we'll see 96 kilohertz here's a moment of truth way there it is so we are getting the full high def lossless file through the btr5 obviously i need to plug my headphones in uh now there aren't that many songs available in 192 kilohertz i found a playlist on reddit which has been curated by someone called rick's thank you ricks that's brilliant so he's found a few songs here in 192. so there's a old favorite hotel california so let's get that one fired up and again if we go to the now playing screen high res losses there you go 24 bit 192 and moment of truth yay success again so the great thing about the iphone and the ipad is when you are connected to an external dac and the sample rate of the song changes it automatically switches it to the correct sample rate sadly the situation on a mac is not so straightforward and i'm going to show you that now so i've got apple music on the mac open here and the first thing we need to do once again is go into our preferences and make sure we are streaming in the lossless heist quality so i'll just do that now so when you open preferences on the playback tab you can scroll down here and make sure that your streaming preference is set at lossless or high resolution lossless and that your download is likewise if that's what you want so i've got both those and once again i've turned dolby at moss off be gone dolby atmos right so we'll click okay so here we've got that beatles album again and once again it's showing me it's in high-res lossless file so as you can see come together the first track is playing and if you go up to the now playing screen you can see yep's definitely playing there the 24-bit 96 kilohertz file however that may not be what you're actually hearing because mac os does not do automatic bit rate switching in fact the bitrate is determined in this program audio midi setup which i've got open here if you open that it shows you all the audio devices on your computer in this case at the moment i've just got the macbook pro speakers so if you click on those and then go to the sample rate you can set it from anywhere between 44.1 all the way up to 96. so if i set it to 44.1 even though i'm playing the 96 kilohertz file as you can see it's going to be down sampled to 44.1 so i have to change it every single time an audio midi setup and 96 kilohertz has maximum resolution that's supported just through the macbook internal speakers so once again if i want to get the full uh high-res audio experience i've got to connect up the fio and okay so i've got my fio connected and if i go back to the audio devices um you can see it's now appeared here fio btr5 so if i go to that and i go to output you can see it's currently set to 1696 but say i change it to for example 16 bit 44 that's cd quality so even though i'm still playing the high res lossless file the os has down sampled it and if i check my sample rate indicator it's 44.1 so i'm not getting bit perfect audio i'm not getting the full high-res experience here which is a bit annoying there's no exclusive mode for the dac from apple music other programs like audiovanna for example which i've got installed here do support direct access to the dac and will automatically switch sample rate but frustratingly apple music doesn't do it at the moment i hope they fix it so there you have it there's my quick guide to getting apple music lossless from ipad iphones and mac but that's it for this video guys let me know what you think in the comments below as always and i'll catch you in the next video [Music] what looks like a giant spaceship parked in the lush flats of cupertino california is actually tech giant apple's new hq fittingly named the apple park this stunning architecture sprawls across acres of land and might just be one of the most stunning campuses in the world despite its incredibly futuristic looks the apple park has been a long time in the making with steve jobs first announcing the project way back in 2006. it took eight long years of planning proposals and permit applications but by 2014 construction was well underway and by 2017 the vast apple workforce was already starting to move in the massive ring-shaped building is now an iconic symbol of the apple brand and is a fantastic testament to the company's dedication to effortless design sustainability and the future of technology it was originally estimated that the campus would cost just half a billion dollars to put together however the land alone cost 160 million dollars and the cost quickly started to overrun by 2011 the budget in place had multiplied to a little under 3 billion and when it was all said and done apple were looking at a bill closer to 5. a 5 billion build is a big sum of money for any company to justify any company except apple that is who's currently worth two trillion dollars and is estimated to profit around 60 billion dollars by the end of this year alone so where was all that money spent and what makes the apple park so incredible for starters the campus is made up of multiple buildings however 80 percent of the land is still considered to be green space apple and the designers put a lot of effort into making the park fit seamlessly into nature planting over 9 000 drought resistant trees throughout the grounds including cherry apricot olive and of course a few varieties of apple to encourage workers to maintain a healthy lifestyle the grounds feature 3.2 kilometers worth of various walking and running trails as well as 1 000 bikes that can be used to commute between the buildings other lifestyle facilities include a gym wellness center and a couple of basketball courts there's also a huge two-story yoga studio where the desk jockeys can wind down and ease out their back pain the campus really does look after its staff and the environment too all of the buildings are incredibly eco-friendly with the main ring construction being home to one of the world's largest rooftop solar farms the solar covered roof generates up to 17 megawatts of power which is enough to meet 75 percent of the campuses energy demand during peak times the rest of the campus's needs are met by on-site fuel cells powered by biofuel or natural gas the main building also utilizes a natural ventilation system meaning that it doesn't use traditional heating and cooling methods for nine months of the year furthering the space's green credentials nicknamed the spaceship or the ring the central circular building is quite a sight to behold sitting four stories high it has over 1.2 million square feet of office space and enough room to accommodate up to 12 000 members of staff to bring the outside world in the design has incorporated a lot of glass into the build and the construction even features the largest curved glass panes in the world there are 800 of the 45 foot tall curved glass panels around the building's exterior and around 3 000 smaller panels to be found within the low energy leds natural sunlight and sheer amount of see-through material make the spaceship a stunningly bright place to be which i'm sure is great at keeping the some 12 000 staff members feeling energized throughout their long working days despite being hidden from sight one of the most amazing spaceship features happens to be found deep underground the main ring is one of the few buildings in the u.s and the world to make use of base isolation which protects the ring from even the worst of californian earthquakes the isolation system is made up of 692 huge stainless steel plates which allow the building to shift up to four feet in any given direction without causing any structural damage also to be found underground is an expansive parking area and road network that's completely hidden from site putting these amenities underground was an absolute necessity in order to maximize the green space in and around the apple park other features to be found around the campus include seven cafes with the largest being sprawled across three levels with enough seating for three thousand people the huge catering team says it has enough capacity to feed around fifteen thousand people every lunchtime so there's definitely some growing room if apple decides to expand its already huge workforce also within the parks grounds is the inspiring apple auditorium formerly known as the steve jobs theatre the spectacular circular glass building mirrors the spaceship in its form and is topped with the world's largest carbon fiber roof the theater includes a 42 foot high glass elevator that takes guests underground to the 1000 seat auditorium made from chemically tempered glass the elevator is also considered to be the tallest freestanding glass elevator in the world other buildings dotted around the park include a one hundred thousand square foot fitness center two three hundred thousand square foot research and development facilities a care clinic and the visitors center which happens to be the only building in the entire park that guests can visit without a pass the apple park visitor center is all under one roof but is divided into four very special sections a ten thousand square foot apple store filled with the latest apple products a two thousand square foot cafe an observation deck where you can look over the campus and a designated ar experience area the ar area includes a scale model of the entire apple park offering visitors an employer's look at life on campus the apple park is so full of amazing features and amenities more so than almost any other work environment in the world apple has thought of everything from their environmental footprint to keeping their workforce full up with food leisure and creativity there have been a few complaints about the open plan office spaces with some workers saying that they are distracting counterproductive and removes opportunity for privacy but still the futuristic facility has been incredibly well received and has set a new world standard in how amazing a work environment can truly be you - This is deepen our calculus about what a good
experience is for a customer and what's healthy for the future of our industry and the
future of the world. - Okay, so stop me if this
isn't the first tech executive you've heard wax on about how their product
can save the world. Except this isn't just any tech executive. This is Apple's Craig Federighi. He sits right below Apple CEO Tim Cook on the org chart. Does Tim Cook really call you Superman? - Certainly not to my face. - Okay. Does he call you Hair Force One? - Lord no. (both chuckling) Usually Craig. - [Joanna] The software on
your iPhone, iPad or Mac, Federighi oversees the
development of it all. He's got a lot of power and he's been putting it
behind a new privacy feature called ATT, App Tracking Transparency, being released today in iOS 14.5. Apps now have to ask to track
you in a popup like this. Apple only gave me 15
minutes with Mr. Federighi to talk about the new feature. - Joanna, am I just a
voice or do I have a face? - So I've got my stopwatch. I did not trust the Apple Stopwatch app. I'm going to give you 30 seconds to explain what App
Tracking Transparency is. - All right, I think I can
do it in eight seconds. - And go. - App Tracking Transparency
gives users the choice of whether they wanna be tracked
across apps and websites. - 8.69. - Oh, sorry. I could do it again faster. - [Joanna] Well, it's
a bit deeper than that. - It also affects
something called the IDFA, which is an identifier that
iOS has had for many years. - [Joanna] Every iPhone has
this unique tracking number and it's used to track
your activity between apps. So say you're thinking about buying, I don't know, Craig's blue shirt in this shopping app. The shopping app has your
unique tracking number. Then you open your
favorite social media app and what do you know? A shirt ad. That's because the two apps
shared info using the IDFA. In iOS 14.5, this number
isn't automatically shared. If you wanna let the app share it, you'd have to tap Allow here. - We needed to make sure both that the user had a clear understanding of the decision and that we gave the
developer an opportunity to explain themselves as to the purpose for which they were
potentially asking to track. And so the developer, of course, can present messaging even
before they ask the system to prompt the user. And then they also get a little area on the panel itself to explain that they're using this for
presenting more effective ads or whatever the case may be. - Why the verbiage ask not to track? Why not just do not track? - There are other techniques that developers over time have developed, like fingerprinting, there's
a bit of cat and mouse game around other ways that an app might scheme to create a tracking identifier and it's a policy issue for us to say you must not do that. And so we can't ensure at the system level that they're not tracking. We can do so at a policy level. - Will there be any Apple
Apps with the ATT popup? - No, not at this time. I mean, there's no Apple
app or service that tracks. There's no app that's sharing information with external data brokers. No app or service of ours that is tracking you across other vendors, apps and websites. If we ever did do something that fits the definition of tacking, we, of course, would
have to show that prompt. - So I wanted to read a quote
from Steve Jobs back in 2010. And he said, "I believe some people." - Wanna share more data
than other people do. Ask 'em. Ask 'em every time. - We the people of the internet, we're sort of sick of popups. I don't wanna speak for
everyone on the internet but I think most are. How did you think about that? - I share your frustration
with sometimes being bombarded with every website usually telling you that they're going to track you with a big blue Accept button and no real choice at all. We had to make it a meaningful choice. And we had to make it a clear choice and one that had effect and that I think is in deep contrast to most of what you see on the internet. As people get today's update and begin to launch apps, they'll see it at first and pretty soon, this will become a pretty
infrequent occurrence, both because some apps will stop tracking or maybe never did. And the apps that you use that do track, you'll make that decision once and that'll be it. - [Joanna] You also have a choice to turn off all these popups and completely opt out of
any tracking in all apps. You can go to Settings, Privacy, Tracking and switch off Allows
Apps to Ask to Track. What will Craig do? - For me, ask app not to track. - [Joanna] And well, that's
what the industry expects the majority of people to pick too. And all sorts of companies, apps and social media networks that rely on data for
personalized advertising aren't happy about it. Facebook specifically has
called Apple's move hypocritical and anti-competitive. - We've been on this road of
improving privacy protections in our platform really since
the beginning of iPhone. Before that truthfully. And so we're accustomed to
initially some panicked responses from some quarters. It wasn't surprising to us I think to hear that some people were
going to push back on this but at the same thing, we were completely confident that it's the right thing
to give users a choice here. - But what's in all of this for Apple? Is this all altruistic for
this trillion dollar company? How much is privacy factoring
into buying decisions? Do you have a sense of that? - I don't know. It's a value that is so deep in us. Personal information can be used and abused and even weaponized in ways that can be
really, really destructive, often in a way that's not at all apparent to the person who might be
giving up that information. Years ago, people were
saying oh, privacy's dead. Everyone's given up their privacy. And so we just kept doing it because to us, regardless of
whether it was a selling point for a phone, we thought
it was the right thing. - A lot of the criticism right now about Apple is about control. And that it has too much control, specifically over its
platforms and the App Store. What's the conversation like right now amongst you and other top
brass at Apple about this? - Well, I think we've always felt that customers have a real choice in terms of what phone they wanna buy, what ecosystem they wanna be a part of. And we think we're
offering people a choice to buy into an ecosystem where there is a degree of curation, where there is protection for privacy, where there are certain standards. We don't think everyone's
going to prefer that choice. - Do you feel like there will need to be from Apple a lessening
of some of the control? - I don't know. I feel like we're making
the right choices now. We're always considering
the right things primarily from a customer perspective. So as long as we're keeping our eye on that North Star, I think we feel good
about the course we're on. - And of course, I had to sneak in a few
non-privacy questions. Wireless charging, corded charging? - I am primarily a cord guys. I have enough devices that it works out for with
my stacking arrangements. - Tim said, I believe it
was a couple weeks ago, that he says that he won't
be at Apple for at least in the next 10 years, he
will not stay at Apple for the next 10 years. Your name's being floating. - Insanity. Yeah, no, that would be irresponsible. - How's the software going
in the mixed reality headset? - I don't know anything about
what you're talking about. - What do you think of mixed reality? - I think it's got a lot of potential. I think it deserves exploration. - [Joanna] Whatever that next
big Apple product looks like, it's a pretty safe bet that Mr. Federighi is gonna be pushing
hard for privacy in it. - These devices are so intimately a part of our lives and contain so much of what we're thinking
and where we've been and who we've been with that users deserve and need control of that information. Abuses can range from creepy to dangerous. here's everything apple announced at wwdc 2021 starting off with ios 15 facetime received a few new features that making connections and staying in touch with other people from a distance is now better than ever users can now watch or listen to movies and music together via facetime calls or share your screen with your facetime call for easier ways to plan trips or maybe just help out a family member with any potential issues that they might be having with their devices i know we've all been there before and this is a much welcome feature spatial audio has been added to conversations that disperses audio into different directions that's tied to where that person is positioned on the screen there's new mic modes that minimize background noise and puts your voice front and center or on the flip side you can turn on wide spectrum mode to share the sounds of your environment during your call you can also arrange participants in a new grid view enable portrait mode during video calls to put the emphasis on you even more and you can now schedule facetime calls with new facetime links in the messages app there's a new shared with you feature that's implemented throughout a few different apps as well like photos and news to view content at a later date that might have been shared with you in a conversation a better way to view photos via photo collections and messages has also been implemented and it can let you cycle through photos in this new stacked view apple also introduced a new notification look as well as notification summary which allows you to catch up on notifications that might not be super time sensitive and can be viewed at a later date in order to catch up later on or maybe when you wake up you can see what you missed throughout the night giving you just an easier way to stay in touch with what's going on but maybe not focus your attention away from what's pressing during that specific moment in time speaking of focus there's a new focus feature that allows only the notifications that you might want or are really time sensitive to get through and will also give users a signal of your status letting your friends know that you might be working or sleeping or having dinner with your family etc for urgent messages there's still a way for users to get through maps now introduces 3d landmarks new driving features like more details and turn lanes making it easier to see which exit you need to get off of but what lane you need to stay inside of there's crosswalks and bike lanes as well as immersive walking instructions and updated transit features like nearby stations and transit times wallet has been updated to now finally add id cards in specific states at this current moment in time like your driver's license there's even new hotel room keys that can be added to your wallet keys to get into your home open up your garage etc apple also announced a new live text feature that can scan text inside of photos to copy and paste into other apps like emails you can even highlight and select text from those photos say there's a phone number in the background you can select and highlight that text and then act on that to make a phone call you can even use this feature to look up objects like animals landmarks books etc spotlight received an improvement with new rich search results for artists shows movies as well as your own contacts and photos has added support for apple music within new interactive memories you can customize your memories and add songs from your apple music library and the photos sync dynamically to the music which is pretty cool some other quick updates to ios 15 include new health app features that allows users to share health information with family members to better track your close family and loved ones there's better metrics to assess whether you might be at risk of falling in the near future and other changes to your health over time for easier monitoring privacy continues to be a focus for apple and it's been improved upon again in ios 15 with app privacy reports showing you when you've granted permissions to those apps and how recently those apps have made contact as well as siri audio is now never leaving your device so requests are a lot faster and safer one quick note about siri that apple very briefly touched on is the fact that siri has now been opened up to third-party devices so other hardware makers can add siri into its speakers thermostats etc apple also added a slew of new features to icloud like icloud private relay hide my email and expanded homekit secure video support without changing its tier of prices so if you have paid for any of icloud features in the past it's now been rebranded to icloud plus and the prices remain the same the biggest features that were announced for ipad os include a brand new way to multitask on an ipad now it's easier than ever to choose an app for split view an easier way to remove an app in exchange for a different app inside of split view too and you can also bring up a new center window like an email in order to view everything inside of that message on top of other things that might be going on inside of split view and there's a new shelf that's been added to view all of your open windows for an application and quickly switch between them the app switcher has been updated to create split view spaces inside of this view as well as create a new split view by dragging one app over another for those using a keyboard you can do all of this by just using shortcuts so you don't have to lift a finger just hold down the command key to bring up those new shortcuts for multitasking you can also finally add widgets on your ipad anywhere on your home screen and there's new larger widgets to take advantage of the larger display my favorite part about the new ipad home screen is the app library you no longer have to have every app on your ipad's home screen something that's been around for the iphone since last year has finally made its way to the ipad quick notes lets you start a note from anywhere on your ipad by swiping from the corner and you can put anything in a quick note like names numbers and even links from safari and it's all kind of dynamic when you're inside of a safari link it'll your quick note could pop up letting you know that you have notes about that specific website and all of those notes are organized inside of the notes app and it's in a nice grid view so that you can find those quick notes easily all of the other privacy facetime share play features that we talked about in ios 15 have also made its way onto ipad os 15. watch os 8 now lets users add portrait mode photos from iphone to your watch face this features a dynamic multi-layered effect that really makes your friends and family pop out and be front and center on your wrist you can also share photos from your watch with a few simple taps can easily switch between different modes like dictation scribble and emojis and focus is even available on watchos 8 so that you can quickly turn on which focused mode that you might be in at that current moment in time and there are a few new health features and fitness features coming like tai chi workouts new guest trainers and apple fitness plus and more and finally mac os 12 is now mac os monterey and this update brings all of those new facetime and shareplay features found inside of ios and ipad os as well as the new messages features that we mentioned earlier like shared with you focus quick notes and other notes improvements like organizing notes with tags sharing notes with mentions and activity view but also a few other new features like airplay to mac which brings all of the great features we love about airplay but now for your mac and also universal control which is witchcraft in my opinion and lets you work across devices seamlessly specifically your ipad you can use your mac's mouse or trackpad between your ipad automatically everything just flows from one device to another you can drag content and links from one device to another and there's no setup required it just works shortcuts is now coming to the mac and you can now create mac specific shortcuts which is going to be fun to see what users come up with and safari received a pretty massive update there's a new look and feel to the tab bar which takes on the color scheme of the specific website that you might be in there's redesigned floating tabs and a more streamlined approach to how you browse the web tab groups is a huge improvement in sorting out all the hundreds of tabs you might have open at one time by categories like travel or cooking etc and you can easily edit or create new categories uh between those groups and keep your toolbar less cluttered and crazy this feature has actually been implemented throughout the rest of the ecosystem where safari is available and on ios the safari navigation bar is now at the bottom and you can easily swipe with your thumb between different groups of tabs too of course there's a lot of other new features that apple didn't quite get around to explaining or briefly touched on and we'll be doing a full deep dive and going hands-on with each new beta over the next week or two so be sure to subscribe to the channel so you don't miss those videos this has been dan with mac rumors thanks so much for watching and i hope to see you around in the next video ["Daydreamer" by Aurora playing] Good morning. And welcome to WWDC. WWDC is an incredibly important event
to Apple, our developers and our users. It's here that we bring
some of our biggest innovations to life. And we have not stopped innovating, doing the work that will enrich
people's lives for years to come. Because we're all looking forward
to a more hopeful tomorrow. That's why we believe it's so important
to have WWDC this year. And while it cannot possibly
feel the same in here without you, I can assure you
that we have a great show ahead of us. This year we're delivering the conference
in a whole new way to all of you around the world,
directly to your home. And we want to welcome you
to our home here at Apple Park. I'd like to first talk to you
about two big things that are happening in the world right now. To start, I want to address the topic
of racism, inequality and injustice and to recognize the pain being felt
throughout our nation, especially in
our Black and Brown communities, after the senseless killing
of George Floyd. And while the events of this past month
are sadly not new, they have caused us to face long-standing institutional inequalities
and social injustices. This country was founded on the principles
of freedom and equality for all. For too many people and for too long,
we haven't lived up to those ideals. We're inspired and moved by the passionate people around our nation
and around the world who have stood up to demand change. We must all aim far higher to build
a future that lives up to our ideals. This means taking action. Two weeks ago, we announced Apple's
Racial Equity and Justice Initiative with a commitment
of one hundred million dollars. Starting in the United States,
and expanding over time, this initiative will challenge
systemic barriers that limit opportunity
for communities of color in the critical areas of education,
economic equality and criminal justice. We also announced something important
for this community, the new Developer Entrepreneur Camp
for Black developers. We want to do everything we can to foster
the brightest lights and best ideas. At Apple, our mission has always been
to make the world a better place, and we're committed
to being a force for change. Right now our world is
also battling a virus that is affecting
the daily lives of billions of people. We want to thank the dedicated people
everywhere, especially our health-care workers, who have made tremendous sacrifices
to take care of those in need. We've also seen the profound impact
our products have had. People are relying on them more than ever
to remain connected to family and friends, to do their work,
to express their creativity, to be entertained
as well as to entertain others. Today the world is counting on all of us, and on the products and experiences
that we create, to move forward. Because throughout history, great challenges have been met with great
creativity and important breakthroughs. That's why we're so excited
about this year's conference. This is going to be truly a unique week, delivered unlike any
that we've done before. There will be more than a hundred
engineering-led video sessions, one-on-one consultations
with Apple engineers, developer forums and so much more, delivered to you from different locations
right here at Apple Park. And this year,
the conference will be available to our entire community
of 23 million developers, as well as anyone who is interested,
for free. Presenting the conference in this way
allows us to be more inclusive than ever. Perhaps this will inspire
the next generation of developers. So even though
we can't be together in person, in some ways we're going to be
more together than ever. Today we're going to push
each of our platforms forward in some exciting and breakthrough ways. With that, let's get started
by sending it over to Craig. Good morning. Great to have you here. As you can see, we've got a lot to cover,
so let's get started with iOS. Together with iPhone, iOS is central to how we navigate
our lives and stay connected. And now we're making it
even more powerful and easier to use. Our new release is iOS 14. This year we've spent time rethinking some of the most iconic elements
of the experience on iPhone. Now it all started here, with a carefully considered Home Screen
that has truly stood the test of time. Of course, over the years, we've kept
the fundamentals largely the same but carefully added features
like folders for organizing your apps, widgets for quick information and personalized experiences
powered by on-device intelligence that serve up just the right thing
at just the right moment. It's hard to imagine iPhone
without these features now. Well, that brings us to this year. We're doing more on our iPhones today
than ever before, so we've rethought some of
the core elements of iOS to reflect this. Let me give you a quick peek. ["Like This Like That" by
BEGINNERS & Night Panda playing] This is gonna be amazing. Let's dig in,
starting with the Home Screen. Today's Home Screen works great,
but as we get more and more apps, we can end up with this: lots and lots of pages. And we tend to forget
what's beyond the first couple. Wouldn't it be great if there were a way to organize
all of those apps without doing a thing? Well, this year we're doing just that
with something called the App Library. It's a new space
at the end of your Home Screen pages that automatically organizes all your apps in one simple and easy-to-navigate view. Let me show you. Here's my Home Screen. Now, like you, I have muscle memory built
for the first page or two, but when it comes to all of these pages, well, honestly, I've lost track
of where a lot of things are. And that's where the App Library comes in. You can see that all of my apps
are automatically organized here. In fact, now with the App Library, I actually don't need all those pages
for all my apps. So we created an easy way
to hide app pages. I just go into jiggle mode,
tap the dots at the bottom, and check this out, I get a zoomed-out view
of all my app pages. I can simply tap
to hide the pages I no longer need. Just like that. And now with those pages hidden, App Library is always
just a swipe or two away. So here in App Library, getting to the app
I'm looking for is really easy. Up at the top I have the Search field, and I get all my apps
organized from A to Z. Now over here on the upper left
I have Suggestions. It uses on-device intelligence to show me the apps
that I'm likely to need next. And on the right is Recently Added, giving me access to the apps that I've
recently downloaded from the App Store. And below are
intelligently curated categories. So I can tap into a category
like Apple Arcade and see all of my apps in that category. Now let's go back. You may notice
that in each of these categories the apps I use most are right here
at the top level, so I can launch one of these directly
with just a tap. So that's App Library. We think this is gonna make it
easier than ever to get to your apps. Next, let's turn to Widgets. Today, widgets help you get information
at a glance. But a lot has changed
since we first introduced these. Now we have Apple Watch, where we're able
to surface so much information on a small screen
that you wear on your wrist. Well, this year,
we're taking all that we've learned to create a completely reimagined
experience for widgets. To start,
they're more beautiful and data rich. And we're introducing different sizes, so you can choose one
that best fits your needs. Let's take a look at them in iOS 14. So let's swipe over to Today View
and take a look at our new widgets. They're just beautiful. And the new designs are
more data rich than ever. And you can see
they now come in a variety of sizes. So you can pick just the right level
of information for each one. Now we like these new widgets so much, we wanted to make them
even more accessible. So check this out. I'm just gonna tap and hold
on the Weather widget, and I can drag it out of Today View
and onto my Home Screen. And watch, as I move it around, the apps just dance out of the way
to make space for my new widget. Let's add a second one. Just gonna tap the plus
here in the upper left and grab on to Podcasts. I can drop it just like that. Now I'm gonna swipe over to page 2 here
and bring back up the Widget Gallery. The gallery is a great place
to explore widgets. Now when I tap on one, I can actually page through
all of the different sizes available. Just like this. But, you know, right now what I want to do
is grab this widget up top. It's a really special one.
It's called the Smart Stack. Just gonna tap it and drop it here. With the Smart Stack,
I can easily swipe through widgets to pick just the one I want
for the moment. But what's really cool is that the Smart Stack can
actually do this for me automatically. So in the morning,
I can get my news briefing. Throughout the day,
find out when I have a meeting coming up. And in the evening, I might get
a summary of my activity for the day. So that's widgets on the Home Screen. We're excited to see how everyone
will customize them in their own way. Next, we're also bringing
Picture in Picture to iPhone. So you can access apps on your iPhone while watching video
or talking on a FaceTime call. Let me show you. So here on my Home Screen, the Smart Stack
is showing me the TV widget. So I can just tap to start playing a show. Now check this out.
When I swipe to go Home, the video automatically goes
into Picture in Picture right over the Home Screen. And when I launch another app, like Notes,
I can keep watching. Now I can drag the picture
to another part of the screen. If I want to make it bigger,
I can even pinch to zoom. And as I move between applications
it stays with me. And what's cool is
I can also swipe it to the side, and the audio keeps playing
when it's off-screen. Now here on the Home Screen
I can bring it back out if I want. And I have controls
to get back to full-screen playback, or I can just tap the "X" to close it. And that's Picture in Picture video. It's a great way
to continue enjoying your video while tapping into everything else
your iPhone can do for you. And that's a quick look at the updates
to the core elements of iOS. We think these new features are gonna
make iOS even more helpful in the moment. Another iconic experience
that's getting a major update is Siri. As much as Siri has advanced
over the years, the visual interface for interacting
with it has remained largely unchanged. When you use Siri, your iPhone
switches to this full-screen UI, obscuring your current context. So this year, we've completely redesigned
the Siri experience with a new compact design. It makes tasks like launching apps
incredibly seamless. For example, if you say, "Open Safari," Siri pops up at the bottom of the screen
and instantly launches the app. Or if you ask for information,
like the weather, results appear at the top of the screen
just like a notification. Now this is especially great when there's information
you want to reference on-screen. For example, you could ask Siri
to add to your grocery list. So that's the new Siri design in iOS 14. But the UI is only part of the story. To tell you more about
how we're making Siri smarter than ever, I'll hand it off to Yael Garten. Thanks, Craig. Siri's getting smarter
and even more helpful every day, and I'm really excited to share
the latest updates with you. Siri helps you in a ton of little ways
every day: playing the morning news,
ordering a coffee, getting directions, setting the alarm before going to bed
and so much more. In fact, Siri's helping so many of you with a staggering 25 billion requests
each month. And Siri's getting more helpful every day. Siri's always been great
for getting information and now has over 20 times more facts
than just three years ago. For more complex questions like "How do hybrid cars work?"
or "What causes seasons?", we recently introduced answers
from websites across the Internet, enabling Siri to help you
find even more answers. Another way Siri helps is
with communication, like sending messages. This year, you can now ask Siri
to send an audio message, and Siri will start recording. This is great when you really want to have
the emotion of your voice come through. Another popular way to send messages
with your voice is using dictation. Keyboard Dictation uses
the same speech recognition as Siri. And leveraging
the power of the Neural Engine, we are now able
to run dictation on-device. This provides great accuracy and privacy. When communicating with someone in another
language, Siri can help with translations. This year we're expanding
to support many new language pairs. This is hugely popular, but we know our users want
more than just translating phrases. They want to have entire conversations. And we believe conversations
between languages should feel natural and easy
and have the ability to stay private. That's why we're introducing
a new app called Translate. It is designed to be the best
and easiest-to-use app for conversations. And it can work completely off-line,
keeping your conversations private. Using advanced on-device machine learning
and the powerful Neural Engine, you can translate your text and voice between any combination
of these 11 languages. So I could have a conversation
with someone in Mandarin, and they could have a conversation
with someone in Russian. Just tap on the microphone and say,
"What are your store hours?" [Siri reads Spanish translation] [Yael] You get back
the text and audio right away. And just turn the phone to landscape
to open conversation mode. We've designed a side-by-side view that's easy for two people to know
which side to follow in the conversation. This mode is incredibly intuitive,
with just a single microphone button because the app intelligently detects
the language spoken and shows translation
on the correct side of the screen. Translate will make communicating
between languages easier than ever before, connecting people in new ways. And we can't wait for you to try it. Thanks, Yael. Next up, Messages. Messages is how many of us communicate
with people most important to us. And now we're using it more than ever. Compared to just a year ago, we have a record number of users
sending a record number of messages. And we've seen people use Messages
more and more to keep in touch
with their closest groups. This year, we're introducing a new way to stay connected
with your most important conversations, giving you new ways
to express your identity with Memoji and making big changes
to how we communicate in groups. To tell you more, here's Stacey Lysik. Thanks, Craig. First, let's get started
with Conversations. From the beginning, Messages was designed to make it really easy
to get to your newest messages. But with so many active conversations, sometimes it can be tough to get to
the ones that are most important to you. So we are introducing a new way to let you stay connected
to your most important conversations: by letting you pin them
at the top of your list so you can always get to them. And you can see messages as they come in
with a beautiful animation on the pin. Next, let's talk about expressing yourself
with Memoji. There are over one trillion ways
to customize your identity with Memoji. In iOS 14, we're adding even more ways
to create your look with over 20 new hair and headwear styles to let you reflect your hobby, profession
and personality. We've also added something that's
even more relevant today: face coverings. And we're adding more age options too. My favorite way of using Memoji
is with Memoji stickers. And now we have
three brand-new Memoji stickers that let you send a hug, a fist bump
or even a blush to your friends. Last, let's chat about groups. When you're talking to a group,
sometimes there's so much going on, it can be hard to keep track
of the conversation. So this year, we're gonna help you
bring order to the chaos. First we're adding inline replies that let you reply
directly to a specific message. You can view replies
in the full conversation or you can view them as their own thread
so you can focus in on the specific topic. To make it even more clear
who a message was meant for, we're introducing mentions. With mentions,
you can just type someone's name to direct a message to them. And now you have the ability
to only be notified when you're mentioned
in the group conversation. And check out
the top of this conversation. We have an all-new design
for how groups appear. It lets you see
all the members of your group, where the most recently active people
are shown largest. And, for the first time ever, you can create a unique visual identity
for your group by setting a group photo or customizing your group's look
with an emoji. Inside the conversation you see group members' photos
around the image. Of course it looks great as a pin. You know who's most recently commented
in the group because their photo will appear
around the outside of the pin. And that's what's coming to Messages
in iOS 14: all-new pinned conversations,
fun updates to Memoji and powerful improvements to groups. Thanks, Stacey. Next, let's take a look at features
that help us while we're out and about. Now we know that life looks very different
for many of us right now, but it won't always be this way. And as things start to open up, we have a new set of features
that will help us explore the world again, starting with Maps. Apple Maps is the best way to navigate
and explore the world, all while protecting your privacy. Over the past several years,
we've added many great features, and of course we've been
rebuilding our map from the ground up. Our new map finished rolling out
across the US earlier this year and brought with it better navigation
and far richer detail for roads, pedestrian paths,
landcover and more. The new map also offers
more accurate information for places and allows us to build incredible features
like Look Around. Maps has come a long way,
and people have noticed. Just look at this quote from Fast Company. "Apple Maps has improved
by leaps and bounds and is a formidable rival to Google Maps. It's also arguably got the better UI, and by far-- by far--
the better privacy policy." We're excited to announce we're bringing our new map
to more countries later this year, including the UK, Ireland and Canada. In addition to the rich detail
and improved accuracy, the new map serves as the foundation
for many great new features. In iOS 14, we're adding things that will make it easier
for people to find places they love and help them get to where they're going in ways that are better
for the environment. To tell you more,
I'll hand it off to Meg Frost. Thanks, Craig. First, let's talk about
finding great places. We have millions of people
coming to Maps every day to discover great new places, whether they're planning
their next big vacation or just looking for
something to eat nearby. In iOS 14, the Maps team will be working with
some of the world's most trusted brands to offer amazing Guides. Guides for great places to eat, shop, meet friends or explore
in cities around the world. You can save Guides
so you can easily get back to them later, and the best part is they automatically
update when new places are added, so you always have
the latest recommendations. In addition to helping you
discover great new places, Maps helps you get there
in a way that's better for the planet. For years,
Maps has made it easy to navigate using environmentally-friendly options
like public transit and walking. With iOS 14,
we're introducing great new features to help our users
reduce their carbon footprint, and our first one is
also our most requested: It's Cycling. We've built an incredible
cycling experience that helps you get around town
on your bike. We're adding a dedicated cycling option
to Maps which allows users to ride their bike
along bike lanes, paths and roads. Maps takes elevation into account to let you know if you're in for
a challenging uphill workout or a leisurely flat ride. You can also see if your route
includes quiet or busy roads. We'll even let you know
if you have a steep passage coming up or if you'll need to carry your bike
up the stairs. You can also choose
to avoid stairs altogether. With iOS 14, we're bringing cycling
to New York City, LA, the San Francisco Bay Area, along with a number of cities in China
like Shanghai and Beijing. And we'll be adding many more cities
in the coming months. For environmentally conscious drivers,
we're also introducing EV routing. If you have an electric car, Maps is going to help eliminate
range anxiety. With iOS 14,
Maps will track your current charge and factor in things
like elevation and weather to automatically add charging stops
along your route. And Maps will know
which type of charger works for your car, making sure to only route you
to compatible stations. We're working with a number
of manufacturers to support EV routing in their vehicles, including BMW and Ford, and we'll be adding many more
in the near future. Cities around the world are also working
to improve air quality and reduce traffic, so we're adding
congestion and green zones to Maps to easily see where they are
along with alternate routing options. In addition, drivers in China can securely store their
license plate number on their iPhone, and Maps will let them know which days
they can enter congested city centers based on that number. And those are just some
of the great new features coming to Apple Maps in iOS 14, making Maps the best product to help users explore
and navigate their world. Thanks, Meg. And now, on to CarPlay, which has transformed
the driving experience for iPhone owners by being the smarter, safer way
to use the apps you love in your car. CarPlay is everywhere,
and it's incredibly popular. Here in the US,
it's available on basically every new car. And worldwide, it's available
on over 80% of new cars sold and has quickly become the default
in-car experience for so many people. People love CarPlay, and we get
some really passionate reactions. Joanna Stern says
it makes her life "infinitely better." We have some great updates for iOS 14. First up, we have new wallpaper options
perfect for the car. And we're adding support
for new categories of CarPlay apps: parking, EV charging
and quick food ordering. In addition to this,
we're really excited for the next step in how we're transforming
your relationship with your car by rethinking car keys. They've been around
for over a hundred years, but they've become big, bulky
and ripe for reimagining. To tell you more about
what we have planned, let's go to the garage
with Emily Schubert. Thanks, Craig. I'm excited to introduce
a digital version of car keys. Now you can leave your keys at home and unlock and start your car
with your iPhone. And the very first car to support this
will be the new 2021 BMW 5 Series. Let me show you how it works. It's super simple. -It uses NFC, and you just tap to unlock.
-[beeps] And I place my phone on the charging pad
and then push to start. [chimes] But this goes beyond just one less thing
you have to keep in your pocket. Digital keys have security benefits. They live in the Secure Element
of your iPhone, and if it goes missing, you can turn off
your keys remotely via iCloud. They're even easier to share
than a physical key. Copies don't involve
trips to the dealership. And you can share
from wherever you are with iMessage. Let's give Craig a key so he can
drive home after we're done here. With each key you share,
you can set options, like a restricted driving profile,
perfect for teen drivers. Which is tempting, but we'll give Craig full access. [phone chimes] -[phone chimes]
-Full access? Thanks, Emily. The new BMW will be available
to customers next month. In addition to adding this feature
to iOS 14, we're also enabling it in iOS 13, so customers can use their car keys
even sooner. Of course,
we want this to work in any car, so we've been working on standards
with industry groups. And this is just the beginning. We're working on technology
that will leverage our U1 chip, which uses Ultra Wideband technology
for precise spatial awareness. So you'll be able to leave your iPhone
in your bag or pocket and still securely
unlock and start your car. We expect to see support for this standard
starting in new cars next year. Now, let's turn to the App Store. Twelve years ago, we revolutionized the industry
with the launch of the App Store. Today we have so many amazing apps
that offer a rich set of experiences, we can truly say
that for everything we want to do, "There's an app for that." So now it's time for us to extend
the success of the App Store and make apps available and accessible
in whole new ways. What if you could have the right app
you needed at just the right moment? Let's look at what it would be like
if you did. [narrator]
Today, no matter what you want to do, there's an app for that. But what if you don't have the app
you need right when you need it? Like when you need to pay for parking.
Well, now there's an App Clip for that. [car chirps] Ooh. Look, a new coffee shop. There's an App Clip for that. Or a friend sends you a message
with a print you like. There's an App Clip for that. That looks nice. Looking for somewhere to eat nearby?
App Clip. Very health conscious of you. Hey, there's a scooter.
Let's take it for a spin. Yep. App Clip. Mmm. Ice cream. Wait.
There isn't one for that yet? Well, soon there could be
an App Clip for that. And that. And that. And that. -And that.
-[martial artist] Hi-yah! An App Clip is a small part of an app. It's light and fast and easy to discover, so you can quickly get what you need
right when you need it. Everything about App Clips
is designed for speed. They start with this card
which quickly pops up. And with just a tap,
you can launch the App Clip. You don't need to enter
credit card numbers because App Clips
can use Apple Pay for payments. And you don't have to manually
log into an account because it can take advantage
of Sign in with Apple. App Clips won't clutter your Home Screen and will only stay along
as long as you need them. But you can easily launch recently used
App Clips from the new App Library. It's always easy to download the full app, and this makes App Clips
an easy way to discover more of what the App Store has to offer. And discovery is key. App Clips are all about getting to a part
of an app at the moment you need it, so it was critical that we made them
really easy to find. App Clips can be easily discovered
and launched from the web. You can launch App Clips from Messages
when friends share them with you. When you want to order takeout
from a restaurant in Maps, you can launch an App Clip
right from a place card. You'll be able to tap on NFC tags out in
the world, on things like parking meters. Or you can scan QR codes to launch App Clips
that work with products you purchase. The best way to discover App Clips will be
with the new Apple-designed App Clip code. So when you see one, you'll know
that there's an App Clip waiting for you. They incorporate
both a visual code and NFC, so you tap on them or scan them with
the camera to bring up an App Clip. App Clips will be great for businesses
that already have apps. But we want to be able
to use App Clips everywhere, including smaller spots
that may not have their own app. So we made it possible for apps like Yelp,
which support multiple businesses, to create App Clip experiences
for each of the places they work with. Developers will create App Clips
from a part of an app, using Xcode and the full power of the SDK. To ensure that they launch quickly, they'll need to be
less than 10 megabytes in size. And that's App Clips. Immediately discoverable, small in size, so they launch fast, integrated Apple Pay for easy payment, Sign in with Apple
for quick and privacy-friendly login and the option to download the full app
from the App Store when you want to keep it around. We can't wait to see all the App Clips
developers will create. And that's iOS 14. It's a huge release that transforms
the core experience of iPhone, with redesigned widgets
right on the Home Screen and a new way to organize your apps
with the App Library. It adds incredible updates
to some of the most popular apps, with powerful improvements
to Messages and Maps, and introduces a whole new way
to tap into apps with App Clips. And next up, iPadOS. ["S.S. Luker's Mom" by Oh Sees playing] Oh, hey, we made it. All right. Well, let's jump right in. iPadOS builds on
all the amazing features of iOS while adding unique capabilities that deliver a distinct experience
for iPad. Like using Apple Pencil for taking notes,
markup and illustration. A reimagined track pad experience that lets you interact with iPad
in a whole new way. And unmatched AR experiences with ARKit and the amazing new LiDAR Scanner
in iPad Pro. All of this combines to put iPad
into a class of its own. iPad excels at "every type of input" and is a "product to do anything
and everything." Which brings us to this year
and our new release, iPadOS 14. Let's start with experience. This year iPadOS delivers
unique made-for-iPad designs that take great advantage
of the iPad's large, multi-touch display. Now iPad has always been about the apps. In the beginning, we focused on
giving the ecosystem of iPhone apps a larger canvas
to deliver new and unique experiences. This quickly sparked
an entirely new set of apps, designed for iPad first, with immersive experiences that transform this magical sheet of glass into whatever you needed it to be. We're proud of the over one million apps
on the App Store today designed just for iPad. With customers continuing to push
their iPads further than ever before, we're extending
the design language of iPad to make apps more streamlined
and more powerful. To give you a live look
at these enhancements, I'll hand it over to Josh Shaffer. Thanks, Craig. Let's take a look at
some of the enhancements to iPadOS. The first thing that you'll notice are the same redesigned widgets
that you saw in iOS 14. They look great on iPad as well, and they give you information at a glance
whenever you go Home. But let's see some of the improvements
in the apps, starting with Photos. iPad is the perfect device
for browsing your photos. Its large canvas lets you immerse yourself
in all your favorite memories. And this year, we're making it even easier
to browse and organize your photos with an all-new sidebar. With just a tap of this button,
I can reveal the sidebar, with all the core functionality of the app
in a single location. My photos remain front and center, but now I can quickly tap to move
between parts of the app. The sidebar is a really powerful way
to organize your photos too. I can easily drag a photo to the sidebar and then just drop it
to add it to an album. We've brought this sidebar to many apps
across iPadOS. Like Notes, where it provides quick and easy access
to all your folders. And Files, where we've consolidated
navigation into the sidebar for a streamlined new design. We've also streamlined the toolbars, adding new drop-down menus
that consolidate functions into a single, easy-to-access button. I can just tap to change views like this. And for even quicker access, I can just tap and drag to change
the sort order, all in a single motion. You'll find this same approach
across other apps, like Calendar, where we've brought controls
into a single toolbar at the top, providing more space for your content and a single unified place to access
all the app's functionality. Finally, Music has been updated to take even better advantage
of iPad's large screen. The sidebar in Music makes it easy
to move between views. I can quickly jump between
the new Listen Now and my playlists. -And once I start playing a song...
-["Caution" by The Killers playing] ...I can bring up the brand-new
full-screen player, where I can see rich album art,
transport controls and lyrics, -all in one single view.
-[song fades] And these are just
some of the enhancements that are coming to apps in iPadOS. We're really loving these new app designs. But there's more, starting with Siri. The new compact Siri design
that you heard about in iOS 14 is especially useful on iPad. Results appear at the bottom right corner, allowing you to easily reference the app
while using Siri. And we applied this same approach
to other parts of the experience... like calls. Now today when you receive a call
on iPad, you see this. [beeps] Whatever you were working on
is suddenly completely covered with the incoming call screen. Not cool. Wouldn't it be nicer
if instead you saw this? [beeps] Well, that's much better. Now an incoming call is presented
with a compact notification that doesn't take you out of context. And you can simply tap to answer
or flick it away to dismiss. And this applies to all calls,
including those from your iPhone or third-party VoIP apps like Skype. [rings] And of course we're bringing this
to iOS as well. We think our iPhone customers
are going to love it. Now there's one more key experience
we've redesigned for iPad this year, and that's Search. Today Search is a full-screen experience, and sometimes you can lose track
of your context. So we've redesigned Search
with a new, compact design. You can start a search from anywhere,
like the Home Screen or over any app. And this makes it easy
to find what you need without feeling like you've left the app
you're working in. But we didn't just redesign it. We've rebuilt Search from the ground up
to be Universal, becoming a single destination
where you can start all of your searches. First, we made it better than ever
as an app launcher. You just start typing a few characters, and you can instantly get
to where you're going. It's also great for finding contacts
to message or call or documents. You can even search directly into apps
like Keynote, Messages, Mail or Files. Or look up information
about people or places. And it's also a great place to start
all of your web searches as well. As soon as you start typing, you get relevant suggestions
to complete your search. And you can get to your web search results
with just a tap. And Search now makes navigating
to your favorite websites just as easy as launching an app. Just type a few letters and the top hit
will take you right to Safari. So those are some of our updates
to the iPad experience. And of course,
you also get the new widgets and all the other great app enhancements
from iOS 14. Next, we want to push forward your ability
to express yourself creatively with improvements to Apple Pencil. Apple Pencil is a game-changing tool that turns iPad into
a professional drawing canvas, a great way to mark up and sign documents and the ultimate note-taking device. What many people love most
about taking notes with Apple Pencil is how they can express themselves
in a free-form way. Mixing handwriting and drawings can be
the best way to capture your thoughts. Now the challenge is
when you want to change things afterwards. Here, working with handwriting
just isn't as easy as with typed text. Now, we sometimes take it for granted, but with typed text
it's so easy to select, copy and paste into another document, or even just make space for more text. Well, this year, we're going to make
handwriting just as easy and just as powerful. But that's not all. Our customers tell us that once they have
an Apple Pencil in their hand, they don't want to put it away. So this year,
we're bringing Scribble to iPad. So you can handwrite into any text field, and it will automatically
be converted to text. To show you all of this in action, I'd like to welcome Jenny Chen
for a live demo. Thanks, Craig. I'm really excited to show you
some great new features we have for Apple Pencil and iPadOS this year. One of the great parts about taking notes
with the Apple Pencil is that it really lets you work
in a free-form way. I can just start writing anywhere. And it's not just about text. I can also express myself
with drawings or shapes. But sometimes you want that
more professional, cleaned-up look. So now, when I draw a simple shape
and pause at the end, it'll automatically convert
to that ideal shape. And we're smart about it,
retaining the same size and angle that you drew it at. In addition to shapes, we've also made huge improvements
to our handwriting recognition. So now, when I write,
I can easily make a selection using the same gestures
that I use for typed text. I can double tap to select a word
or double tap again to select a line. Thanks to our advanced,
on-device machine learning, you'll notice how we can
select the handwriting while avoiding the drawings nearby. Now that I have the selection, I can easily change the color
or move it around the document. It's also perfectly easy for me
to make space for more room to write. We think that this will make note-taking
with the Apple Pencil even better. Now, you don't even have to put it down
when you want to do something else. Let's say you want to search
for "Edison bulbs" in Safari. Using Scribble, I can just write
directly into the text field... and it automatically
gets converted to typed text. It also works in any text field, so I can easily add a new Reminder to my shared Reminders list
with my husband. I've also been learning Chinese, so I want to surprise him
with some of my progress and skills. I'll use Scratch to delete "lights." And then I can use Scribble to write "new"
and then "light fixture" in Chinese. You'll notice how Scribble recognizes
both English and Chinese in the same line. And what's awesome is that
we can build on this technology to deliver other great features,
like Data Detectors. We can automatically detect
what you write, like phone numbers,
so I can make a phone call. Or addresses, so I can look up directions. We can use these features together
to do even more with your handwriting. Let's say I wanted to use my handwriting
in another app. I can easily select what I want, tap the new Copy as Text
from the callout bar, and then paste it into an app like Pages. And it's automatically converted
to typed text. We're really excited
about these awesome new features. And we think it will let you do
even more with the Apple Pencil. Thanks, Jenny. So those are the enhancements to Pencil. Just one part of an amazing release, with Scribble for handwriting
into any text field, a whole new way to work
with your handwritten notes, broad enhancements to the app experience, and of course, iPad users also benefit from the great features
you already saw in iOS 14 and much more that
we didn't have time to talk about. So that's iOS and iPadOS. Next, let's talk about AirPods. From the one-click setup to the automatic pairing
with all your devices to how they pause your audio
when you take them out, people love the magical experience
that AirPods deliver. Now we're bringing even more magic
to AirPods. To tell you all about it,
here's Mary-Ann Ionascu. Thanks, Craig. We have some amazing updates
coming to AirPods, starting with Automatic Switching. AirPods will now seamlessly move
between your devices without you having
to manually switch them. Let's say you just finished
listening to a podcast and you pick up your iPad to watch a show. AirPods will magically switch over. And later you start a video conference
on your Mac. AirPods will automatically switch again. -[ringing]
-And if a phone call comes in, the audio in your AirPods
will route right back to your phone. We also have an exciting new feature
coming to AirPods Pro: spatial audio. You know the experience
of being in a movie theater with a state-of-the-art
surround sound system, one where the sound
not only comes from in front of you... -[tone pulsing]
-...but also from the left, the right, behind, and even from above you? Well, we are thrilled to bring that same
immersive experience to AirPods Pro. But it turns out it's a lot harder to do when you only have a single earbud
in each ear. So our team created advanced
spatial audio algorithms for AirPods Pro that replicate
the movie theater experience. By applying directional audio filters and subtly adjusting the frequencies
each ear receives, we can place sounds
virtually anywhere in space... [high-speed vehicles passing] ...creating an immersive
surround sound experience. But to truly deliver on this promise,
we had to factor in real-life situations. First, people move their heads. For an authentic
surround sound experience, you need the sound field to stay fixed so the voice feels like
it's coming from the actor and not some random point in space. So we use the accelerometer
and gyroscopes in AirPods Pro to track the motion of your head, remapping the sound field
so it stays anchored to your device, even as your head moves. And it's not only your head that can move, but you might move
your iPad or iPhone as well. That's why we constantly compare
the motion data from your head and your screen to understand how they are moving
in relation to each other. So if your bus turns the corner
or your plane banks, the sound stays in sync. The result is a surround sound experience that keeps you
in the middle of the action, no matter where you go. Spatial audio for AirPods Pro will work
with content encoded in 5.1, 7.1, and even Dolby Atmos. Thanks, Mary-Ann. I've been using the new spatial audio, and I think you're all
really gonna love it. All right. Next let's head
to the Fitness Center to hear the latest on watchOS from Kevin. ["I'm Getting Tired"
by Jacknife Lee playing] [song ends] Thanks, Craig.
Since we launched Apple Watch, it's completely redefined
what a watch can do, and this has been
incredibly meaningful work. Apple Watch not only helps you
stay connected and active, it's become an intelligent guardian
of your health, enabling you to take an ECG, detect falls
and call emergency services for you. It's impacting lives in ways
that were inconceivable five years ago. The power of Apple Watch
is not only its built-in features, but how developers
have personalized it for you. We introduced the App Store in watchOS 6, and there are now over 20,000
watchOS apps available. These apps bring the information
you care about most to just a glance at your watch face. We're taking this even further
in watchOS 7, starting with complications. Until today, an app could appear in only
one spot at a time on a watch face. In watchOS 7 developers can
enable multiple complications, making even more richly personal
watch faces. So if you like to use
Dawn Patrol for surfing, you can create your own surf watch, including water temperature,
swell and wind speed predictions for your favorite beach. Or new parents can use Glow Baby to see nap, changing and feeding times
all on one face. While Nike Run Club can display stats
like pace from your last run and your weekly run goals. We're also bringing rich complications
to more faces, including a fresh Chronograph face with an integrated tachymeter and an updated Extra Large face with a huge, rich complication
right in the center. And Configuring Watch Faces
has been redesigned so you can easily select
which information you'd like to see. As developers, with watchOS 7 you can now build your rich complications
with native SwiftUI. While there are so many ways
to configure watch faces, you may not have yet gone in
and set these up for yourself yet. That's okay. With watchOS 7 we're making it super easy
to share watch faces, so you can discover a face
that works perfectly for you. To do this,
we're introducing Face Sharing. You'll be able to discover curated faces
with third-party apps on the App Store, or discover a new favorite watch face
right on a website, or receive watch faces
directly from friends and family. Let's take a look at how this works. When you see a watch face you'd like,
you just press "Add Apple Watch Face." If the watch face uses some apps
that you don't have yet, you'll be offered each one right here
so you can easily get them if you like. And the new face appears
right on your watch. If you'd like to share a face
you've created yourself, that's also really easy. Just long press on the face, tap "Share," pick a contact and send. Developers can offer preconfigured
watch faces right from their apps. You can even share watch faces
across social media. It's a great way for the community
of Apple Watch wearers to connect and help each other discover all the
amazing things Apple Watch is capable of. Next, let's talk about Maps. Maps is great for walking, driving
and transit directions, and now in watchOS, just like in iOS 14, you can get cycling directions. You'll see a variety of routes with information like time, distance and whether there are bike lanes. You can preview travel time
and elevation changes and navigate with turn-by-turn directions
that are large and easy to read. Maps can direct you to dismount
and walk your bike or even take the stairs to save time. You can also search for and add places
optimized for cyclists, like bike repair shops. [chimes] Now to tell you about
how we're advancing Workouts, please welcome Julz Arney. Thanks, Kevin. The Workout app uses algorithms
that are smartly tuned to track all aspects of your training. It's one of the most used apps
on Apple Watch, and we've continued to add support
for new workout types every year. -And in watchOS 7 we're adding Dance.
-[dance music playing] Dance is a total body workout
that's great for your heart. It makes you more fit and flexible,
and you're guaranteed to have fun. Whether you're doing Hip Hop, Latin,
Bollywood, or simply Cardio Dance, the Workout app now tracks some of the world's most popular
styles of dance for fitness. Getting the most accurate credit for Dance
presented a unique challenge. Arm movements aren't always repetitive
or synchronized with leg movements like in running and walking. The solution was to use
advanced sensor fusion. [music continues] In Dance, we combine data from
the accelerometer and the gyroscope to detect the difference between
dancing with just your arms... just your lower body... or when you put it all together
and dance with your entire body. Then we add in heart rate data for the most accurate
calorie burn calculations. watchOS 7 also tracks accurate calories
for Core Training, those exercises for your abs and back, Functional Strength Training, a workout type that helps you get stronger
and move better for everyday activities, and also Cooldowns to add on to another workout when you want to continue
with easy moves and stretches as you bring your heart rate
and breathing back to normal. Of course, you can track your progress
for any of these new workouts inside the Activity app on iPhone, which is completely redesigned
in watchOS 7. The app now features a new Summary tab that gives you an easy way
to see your activity history, workouts and trends,
all in one seamless view. With a new focus on easy navigation
and summary metrics, the app is getting a new name as well: [music continues] Fitness. Back to you, Kevin. -[record scratches]
-[music ends] Thanks, Julz. Apple Watch helps you meet
not only your fitness goals, but also helps support your health with features such as Cycle Tracking,
the Breathe app, and Noise notifications. And we're going to be adding even more
capabilities this year in watchOS 7. We'd like to share a couple of them
with you today, starting with one of the most-requested
features for Apple Watch: tracking your sleep. To tell you about this, over to Vera Carr. Thanks, Kevin. There are many ways to look at sleep:
scores, advanced monitoring, or sleep cycle analysis. We are taking
a more holistic approach to sleep by leveraging the devices you use
every day to not only track your sleep but to support you in actually meeting
your sleep duration goal. That starts with choosing not only when
you would like to wake up in the morning, but also when you'd like to go to bed. For most of us, setting a goal is easy. But getting to bed on time,
that's the hard part. Experts say that establishing
a bedtime routine helps the body transition
from wakefulness to sleep. So we are offering Wind Down. It can help you get to bed on time
by minimizing distractions and creating a personalized routine. Let's look at how this works. In the evening, ahead of your bedtime, your phone can display
the Wind Down screen to help you transition mentally
before you go to bed. It creates a calm lock screen experience
and turns on Do Not Disturb for you. You can also set up shortcuts for simple things you may like to do
to help you prepare for bed. These might include
using your favorite meditation app or playing relaxing music. Once it's time for bed, your screen will dim and your watch
will go into Sleep Mode, which looks like this. The screen will be off during time in bed
so it won't bother you, and a tap displays this simple face. When it's time to wake up, you have a selection of gentle
and effective alarm sounds, or a silent Taptic-only wake-up alarm
so you don't disturb your partner. Once you're up, you'll see a friendly
greeting easing you into the day. It also shows your battery level so you can remember to charge
in the morning. Apple Watch tracks your sleep using a machine-learning model
that senses your motion and even interprets the micro-movements caused by the rise and fall
of your breath, providing signals for when you're awake
and when you're asleep. There's an updated Sleep section
in the Health app, including a view of your trends over time. Sleep Schedules, Wind Down, and Sleep Mode are also available on iPhone,
without a watch, in iOS 14. We know you'll enjoy using
your watch throughout the day and now throughout the night. Thanks, Vera. In addition to sleep keeping you healthy, there's another preventative-care item
that's so important, particularly now: handwashing. In watchOS 7, Apple Watch is the first watch
to deliver automatic detection when you start washing your hands
and sensing of how long you actually wash. Our approach here is using
machine-learning models to determine motion
which appears to be handwashing and then use audio
to confirm the sound of running water or squishing soap on your hands. During this, you'll get a little coaching
to do a good job. You'll see a countdown,
along with haptics and sounds, to make sure you wash
as long as you're supposed to. If you pause early,
there's a polite note to keep washing. And when you're done,
you'll see, hear and feel it. That's just some of what's coming
this year in watchOS 7, including discovering and sharing faces,
new workout types, sleep and handwashing detection, and other new capabilities
like Siri language translation. And that's Apple Watch. It's time for you to join Craig again to talk about something
that's important to all of us. Here we go! ["I'm Getting Tired"
by Jacknife Lee playing] [song ends] At Apple, we believe
privacy is a fundamental human right. So we build it into our products
from the beginning of the design process. Privacy matters now more than ever. And because our devices contain
our most sensitive information, all of our product work is grounded
in a set of privacy principles. First, data minimization. We use innovative technologies
and techniques to minimize the personal data
we or anyone else can access. Second, on-device intelligence. We avoid data collection by processing as much of your information
on your device as we can rather than sending it to a server. Third, security. Security protections are foundational
to everything we do in privacy. And finally, transparency and control. It helps you better understand
the data being collected so that you can make your own choices
about how that data is used. These principles come together
across our products, in our hardware,
our software and our services. At the end of the day, they result
in great privacy and great ease of use. A powerful example of this
is Sign in with Apple, which is designed for simplicity,
security and privacy. And since we launched it last year, users have created
over 200 million accounts across a wide variety of apps
and websites. And developers are seeing great usage
when they adopt it. For example, Kayak has integrated Sign in with Apple and found that their users are now
two times more likely to use it than any other sign-in provider. Now, one thing we hear a lot
with Sign in with Apple is that people wish they could convert
their existing accounts to use it. So this year we're going to enable
developers to let you do just that. When you upgrade, you get the ease of use and built-in security
of Sign in with Apple while keeping the account
that you already have. This is another big year
of privacy improvements in our products. And to tell you more, here's Katie Skinner
and Erik Neuenschwander. Thanks, Craig. First let's talk about location. This year we're continuing to give you
even more control. In addition to the option
of sharing your precise location, you will have the option to only share
your approximate location with apps. We're also making changes
for mic and camera so you always know when you're recording. In addition to requiring your permission, this year we're adding more visibility
for current or recent mic or camera use. So if an app uses either one,
we'll indicate that in the status bar. [Katie] Next, let's talk about tracking. Safari's Intelligent Tracking Prevention
has been really successful on the web. And this year, we wanted to help you
with tracking in apps. We believe tracking should always be
transparent and under your control. So moving forward, App Store policy will require apps to ask
before tracking you across apps and websites
owned by other companies. [Erik] Last, let's talk about app privacy. Today we require that apps
have a privacy policy. Wouldn't it be great to even more quickly
and easily see a summary of an app's privacy practices
before you download it? Now, where have we seen
something like that before? For food, you have nutrition labels. You can see if it's packed with protein
or loaded with sugar, or maybe both, all before you buy it. So we thought it would be great
to have something similar for apps. We're going to require each developer
to self-report their practices. [Katie] We'll show you what they tell us. You can see if the developer is collecting
a little bit of data on you or a lot of data, or if they're sharing data
with other companies to track you, and much more. [Erik] We're going to put this information on product pages in the App Store. So for each app, you can see
highlights of their privacy information before you download it. And we're going to include this
in all of our App Stores. Back over to you, Craig. Thanks, Katie and Erik. These are some of the ways we're
strengthening the privacy of our platforms and bringing new features
to give users even more control. And one of the places where
privacy matters most is your home. Like most of you, in the past few months I've spent
more time at home than I ever imagined. It's more clear than ever
just how important it is to live in a home
where the technology just works. That brings us to some great new features
we're bringing to the home this year. All of these features share
a few key attributes. First, anything we develop for the home
should be easy, from initial setup to everyday use, just like how a tap of your iPhone
can automatically configure an Apple TV. Second, home products should never
compromise your privacy. That's why your Siri requests use
a random identifier, not your Apple ID. And finally, your devices should
all work better together, like how AirPlay lets you share
from your iPhone straight to the TV. And when things are easy, private
and work together seamlessly, your home is more enjoyable, whether you're watching TV,
listening to music or getting the most
out of your smart devices. To tell you more
about what we have in store for the home, let me pass it to Yah Cason. Thanks, Craig. Let's start by talking about
the smart home. With HomeKit,
we've given developers a robust framework to create smart home accessories
that are remarkably easy to set up all while being end-to-end encrypted
to your Apple devices. Already there's a rich ecosystem
of devices available. But we want to make it even easier
to build products that work across more homes. So we formed an alliance and partnered with Amazon, Google
and other industry leaders to define a new interoperability
standard for the smart home. We open-sourced HomeKit to ensure its ease of use and privacy
are core to this effort. And any accessory using HomeKit
or this new standard will work incredibly well
across all your Apple devices. And you control it all in the Home app, the most secure way
to manage your smart home. Adding new devices to your home
has never been easier. Simply tap or scan to set up an accessory. And in iOS 14, after you add an accessory, the Home app will now suggest
useful automations so you can immediately
put your new device to work for you. Automations are rules
that set your home to autopilot, like automatically turning on
your porch lights when motion is detected or having the garage door open
as you arrive home. And now when you open the Home app, you'll see a new visual status
right up top that prioritizes the accessories
which most need your attention. You can easily see if you've left
a door unlocked or the lights on and quickly control them. Let's take a closer look at one of the most popular categories
of HomeKit accessories: Lights. Millions of us have already added
smart bulbs to our homes, many of which can change color on demand. In iOS 14, we're introducing a feature to help you
get the most out of those bulbs: Adaptive lighting. Adaptive lighting automatically adjusts
the color temperature of your lights throughout the day. Turn it on to ease into the morning
with warm colors, stay focused and alert midday
with cooler ones, and wind down at night
by reducing blue light. Adaptive lighting ensures
you get the right color at the right time. Another popular smart home category
is cameras. With HomeKit Secure Video
your cameras are completely private. And in iOS 14, we're making your cameras
work even harder for you. You'll be able to define Activity Zones
that focus on the most important areas. This is great if you face a busy sidewalk and only want to be alerted when people
actually walk up to your front door. Another powerful feature we're bringing
to cameras is face recognition. HomeKit cameras and video doorbells will
now provide even richer notifications, telling you who's there
by leveraging the friends and family you've already tagged in your Photos app. And face recognition extends to HomePod,
announcing who's at the door. And with Apple TV, you'll get a live view
whenever someone rings the bell. In fact, all your HomeKit-enabled cameras
will be directly integrated with tvOS 14 so you can quickly bring them up
in the new home view in Control Center. Or just ask Siri to pull up any camera
at any time. You can even take any camera full-screen, giving you a great view
of what's going on. And we have even more coming to tvOS 14. Now let me pass it to Cindy Lin
to tell you about it. Thanks, Yah. Apple TV is my favorite way to unwind
and enjoy entertainment with the family. With 4K, HDR, Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos, you get a theater-like experience
right in your living room, making all your movies and shows
look and sound amazing. But Apple TV goes beyond video. You can access
the entire Apple Music collection and even sing along with timed lyrics. You can play
an incredible selection of games, including all the games in Apple Arcade. And we're making gaming on Apple TV
even more personal by expanding multiuser support. Now you can instantly resume your games
exactly where you left off. Just open Control Center
to switch between users, and you can now see your game progress,
achievements and friends. And for even more fun,
we're adding support for Xbox Elite 2
and Xbox Adaptive Controllers. Apple TV
also helps you keep active at home with a great selection of fitness apps. And with tvOS 14, we're gonna make your workouts,
and everything you do on Apple TV, even more productive
by extending Picture in Picture across the entire Apple TV experience. So you can keep up with the news
or not miss a second of the big game. You can even have an AirPlay session
show up in a Picture in Picture window. And AirPlay is getting even better. Now the whole family can share
their stunning videos captured on iPhone in their full 4K resolution. With videos, music, games and more, Apple TV truly offers something
for everyone. Of course, nothing compares
to being captivated by a good story. And we've built a service for just that:
Apple TV+. We've already created
an incredible lineup of Apple Originals. And you can watch them all
in the Apple TV app, which is available
on your favorite Apple devices, on all major streaming boxes and many popular smart TVs. It's already reaching
over a billion screens. And it's coming to Sony and Vizio
smart TVs later this summer. Today, we're really excited
to tell you about a new Apple TV+ Original that we're working on. Almost 70 years ago, Isaac Asimov introduced the world
to a series of epic novels that spanned hundreds of worlds
and thousands of years. Many consider it to be the best
science-fiction series of all time. I'd like to share a sneak peek
with you now. This is Foundation. [dramatic music playing] They're going to arrest me tomorrow. And you. It's almost a certainty. You're familiar with my work,
psychohistory? Yes, in theory.
But I don't know what it has to do with-- It's not a theory. [Salvor] They're worried
you can predict the future. [whirring] [Hari]
They're worried people believe I can. [whirring] And they don't like the future I predict. The empire will fall. Order will vanish. There's massive events rushing to meet us. [Salvor] Only we can shorten the darkness. [music fades] Wow. I'm super excited to watch Foundation
when it comes to Apple TV+ next year. With Apple TV, your home
has never been more entertaining. And with adaptive lighting,
face recognition for cameras and these other great features, your time at home
has never been more enjoyable. Now let me hand it back to Craig. Welcome back. Now let's talk about some big changes
coming to macOS. Since its introduction, macOS has revolutionized the experience
of using a computer by combining incredible power
with incredible ease of use. And it's loved
by all different types of users, from families and students to creative pros, businesspeople
and, of course, software developers. And this year, we're taking
the macOS experience you love even further. But what should we call it? Well, if you're a student of macOS,
you know this question can only be answered by Apple's
legendary crack marketing team. Their drug-fueled,
minibus-driven vision quests have yielded some great names and, sadly, spawned a host of imitators. The truth is,
we can't responsibly continue to inadvertently lead our competition
to copy these methods when they clearly can't handle the trip. So this year, we're leaving our process
shrouded in mystery and taking you straight
to the glorious destination. Our next release of macOS
is macOS Big Sur. macOS Big Sur introduces
an entirely new design and major updates to some of
the most essential apps on the platform. And just like its name, Big Sur brings you unmatched levels
of power and beauty. Let's start with design, where we're making the biggest change
since the introduction of Mac OS X. To tell you more about the philosophy
and incredible craftsmanship behind the new design, here's a short video with Alan Dye. [piano playing] At Apple, design has always been
about great ideas. Those ideas then are developed
with this obsessive dedication to detail. If we care enough about all the details
that make up a product, then in the end
we will have designed an experience that really feels like
there's no other way it could be. And the best example of this
is macOS Big Sur. Our goal was to bring even more clarity
to the design of the software while retaining the Mac's
powerful capability and ease of use. We started with the simplest of elements, from the shape of a corner radius
to refinements in buttons and controls. And we brought our unified language
of symbols to the Mac, making them more consistent
and easier to recognize. Depth, shading and translucency are used to create hierarchy. These new materials are rich,
and they're vibrant. They bridge light and dark. We've reduced visual complexity
to keep the focus on users' content. Buttons and controls appear
when you need them, and they recede when you don't. There's a new way
to access system-level controls and a unified space
for notifications and widgets. We've also created a new suite of sounds. They're familiar to the Mac,
but remastered and more refined. [pulses] [alert notifications chiming] We wanted consistency
throughout the ecosystem, so users can move fluidly
between their Apple devices. But we also love that Mac icons
have a deep history and a distinct look and feel. So we've retained
many of the highly crafted details and the playful elements
that make Mac icons unique. This OS reflects an important history. It's familiar, but it's also
entirely new in every detail. We love the Mac. It's the tool we use to make all the
products that we put out into the world. And macOS Big Sur is where it starts. [Craig] So that's the thinking
behind our new design. Now let me show it to you
in action with a demo. As Alan said, we've refined some of the most iconic
elements of the Mac experience. Let's start with the Dock. It has an elegant new design that floats
along the bottom of your desktop. And you'll notice that we've created
gorgeous new app icons for all of your favorite apps. Speaking of apps,
let's take a look at the Finder. You notice it has a gorgeous new
top-to-bottom design for the sidebar, and it has a compact,
space-efficient toolbar. Makes it really easy
to get to all of your controls. Next, let's take a look at Mail. You can see that Mail has
all-new glyphs in the sidebar, and you may have noticed
that we've brought color back as well. Now, each app uses its own key color. That same color is used for the elegant
new rounded row selection style here in the message list. Now, the toolbar makes it really easy
to get to all your controls. Check out how the search bar expands
as I click on it. And, of course,
other operations like filtering, they're just a click away. Next, let's take a look at Photos. It's just stunning. You can get to all your albums
and media types from the sidebar, and the photo grid is backed by Metal, so animations are super smooth whether I'm scrolling, transitioning or zooming all the way in
or all the way out. It's beautiful. Now we've refreshed the design
for all the apps on the system, from apps like Calendar and Notes to Podcasts and Music,
with its new Listen Now pane. And an all-new version of iWork
that features a simplified toolbar. You may have noticed
we've also updated the menu bar. It's now translucent and elegantly takes
on the color of your desktop picture. And we've updated the layout
of menus as well. We've given all the items
just a little bit more room to breathe. Now, on the Mac, we love our ability
to get directly at controls, like Wi-Fi or Sound. And you can see that we've reworked these
to be even more useful. But we've gone even further this year by giving you one place
to get at all your controls. We've brought Control Center to the Mac. All of my controls are here,
and it's really easy to make adjustments. For instance,
I can change display brightness here or I can click to dive in for more, like turning on Dark Mode
or activating Night Shift. And what's really cool is
that I can customize the menu bar with any of these controls. So, say I want one-click access
to Do Not Disturb. I can just click and drag it
right into my menu bar and customize just like that. Now we've also reinvented
Notification Center. You can access it by clicking on the time
in the upper right. And as you see, we now have a single view that brings your notifications and widgets
together all in one place. And we now group
related notifications together. You can easily expand them
to take a closer look or clear them all out in one step. And we're bringing our redesigned widgets
to the Mac. They're really beautiful. And you have all-new ways
to customize them. I'm just gonna click "Edit Widgets"
down here at the bottom. And you can see
I have a gallery of all my widgets, and they come in a variety of sizes. I can select between them just like this. And developers can bring
their own widgets as well, like this one here from Day One. Now adding widgets is easy. Let's start by adding,
say, the World Clock. Maybe I'll add Notes in. And it'd be kind of cool
to add my Reminders list as well. So that's a look at Widgets,
Notification Center and our all-new design in Big Sur. Next, there are exciting updates
for some of the most-used apps on the Mac. First, let's talk about Messages. Messages on the Mac is designed to work
seamlessly with all of your devices, so your SMS and iMessage conversations
are in sync no matter what device you're using. Now this year we're taking Messages
to the next level with a ton of great new features. We're introducing powerful search
to help you find what you're looking for. We have a redesigned photo picker
to make sharing photos and videos easier. And Memoji. You can now create
and edit your Memoji right on your Mac. And Memoji stickers
bring personality to messages, giving you fun ways to express yourself
in all of your conversations. Messages effects helps you
celebrate special moments and get your point across. And you're also getting
pinned conversations that are synced across devices
so you can always get to them, along with new Groups enhancements. So that's what's coming
to Messages on Mac: powerful tools
to manage your conversations and new ways to express yourself. Next up, Maps. Apple Maps is the best way
to explore and navigate the world, whether you're planning a trip on the Mac or using turn-by-turn directions
on your iPhone. Today I'm excited to announce
an all-new version of Maps for the Mac. To start,
Maps features a stunning new design that makes it easy to find your way around
using Apple's detailed new map. And for the first time on the Mac, Favorites like home, work
or that great coffee shop on the corner are now just a click away. You can now create your own Guides
of all the places you want to visit right on your Mac. And before leaving for the airport, you can check where your gate is located
with indoor maps or explore your destination city
with Look Around, which is incredible on the big screen. We've even brought
other useful features to the Mac, like the ability to see
the progress of friends who have shared their ETA with you. And the Mac gets
all the other new Maps features we just introduced in iOS 14. And that's just a taste of what's coming
in the all-new Apple Maps on the Mac. Next let's talk about Mac Catalyst. Catalyst gives developers a big head start in creating a Mac app from an iPad app. Take, for instance, our recent release
of Swift Playgrounds for Mac. Catalyst gave us a big head start
creating the app, and we were able
to spend our development time crafting a great Mac experience. Today we have some improvements
to Mac Catalyst I'd like to share. This year, developers will be able
to optimize their apps to fully utilize the native resolution
of the Mac screen, providing total control of every pixel. We've also given developers
new capabilities, including powerful new menu
and keyboard APIs and updated controls
like checkboxes and date pickers. They look great
with the new design of macOS. In fact, we used Catalyst
with the new version of Maps. And just as you'd expect, it's a full-fledged Mac app
that runs natively and is designed
in a way that's true to the Mac. So you get multiple resizable windows,
keyboard shortcuts and everything else you'd expect
from a native Mac app. And we did the same thing for Messages. Maps and Messages join
the great set of apps from Apple that already use
the Mac Catalyst technology. And there's a growing list
of third-party Catalyst apps available on the Mac App Store. Next... Safari. Our users love Safari for its speedy performance,
power efficiency and state-of-the-art privacy protections. And it delivers all of that while making it easy to get to your
bookmarks, tabs and browsing history across all of your devices. This year, we're building
on Safari's amazing performance, elegant design
and pioneering privacy protections to deliver the biggest update to Safari
since it was first introduced. As you know, Safari has long been
the world's fastest desktop browser. This year, Safari's performance
running JavaScript is better than ever and continues to significantly outpace
all other major browsers. And now, when it comes to page loading,
we're even faster there too. In fact, when loading
frequently visited websites, Safari is now on average
more than 50% faster than Chrome. And Safari delivers
this amazing performance while continuing to deliver
industry-leading battery life. And of course,
Safari is continuing to build on its pioneering track record
of protecting user privacy. Safari was the first browser to introduce
private browsing, cookie blocking, and most recently,
Intelligent Tracking Prevention. This year, we want to give our users
even more visibility into how each site they visit
tries to track them and the ways that Safari protects them. So now users can click on
the Privacy Report button in the toolbar when they visit a site to better understand
how that site is treating their privacy. In addition to monitoring
unwanted tracking, Safari now also securely monitors
your saved passwords to ensure that they haven't been
compromised in a data breach. And this is also a big year
for extensions in Safari. We're adding support
for the WebExtensions API so developers can easily
bring over extensions that they built for other browsers. And we're building an all-new category
in the Mac App Store to showcase Safari extensions
so users can easily find them. Now extensions are very powerful but can introduce privacy challenges. In other browsers, extensions can access
every page you visit, every tab you open, even everything you type. So we're doing even more here. In Safari, you choose
which sites each extension can work with, and you can even give them access
just for the day, just for the website or all the time. But improved performance, power efficiency and privacy protections
are only the start. We have a whole slew
of new features this year. From a customizable start page to redesigned tabs
that are more elegant and powerful, and native translation capabilities
built right into Safari. To tell you more,
I'll hand it off to Beth Dakin. Thanks, Craig. I'm so excited to give you
a tour of the brand-new Safari. When you open Safari,
right away you'll notice the new look. It's clean and fresh. I want to show you
one of my favorite new features: the customizable start page. I love it because I can make it my own. It's easy to get to
the customization controls here in the bottom corner. We think a lot of people are gonna want
to set a background image, and there's a beautiful gallery
of curated wallpapers to choose from. You can use one of your own photos, too,
and I know I want a photo of my son. I have a few really cute ones
here in the downloads. I can just drag and drop to set it. That is so perfect. You can add new sections
to the start page too. Let's add iCloud Tabs and Reading List. Let's take a look. There. This is perfect. I use Reading List all the time,
and now it's so easy to get to. Another way that you can dial in Safari
to suit your specific needs is with extensions. I can't wait for you developers
to bring your web extensions to Safari. I've gone ahead and downloaded
a few web extensions to take a peek. So let's go here to the Safari preferences
to enable them. And I'll enable Power Thesaurus
and Recipe Filter. So each of the extensions
that I just enabled now has its own button
here in the toolbar. Let me show you Recipe Filter.
I love this one. So this extension will search
the web page for a recipe, and if it finds one,
it will pop it up in a little card. It's been a great accelerator for me
when I'm building a grocery list. So the extension hasn't done anything yet
because I haven't granted permission. So let me click on the toolbar button, and I'm going to allow this extension
for one day. And when I click here, it'll do its thing. So here we go. And there it is. So useful. Okay, so I have my personality pretty thoroughly stamped
over Safari at this point. And you know,
I use Safari for a lot of personal things, and Apple makes sure
my private life stays private. Privacy is essential to everything we do
at Apple, and it's critical on the web. And now you can see
what Safari is doing to protect you. If I click on the
Intelligent Tracking Prevention button, I can see the number of known trackers that Safari protected me from
on this web page. I can click here to see a list of the known trackers
right here in this popover. And the full privacy report
is just one click away. And that's what we have for privacy
in the new Safari. Next I'd like to talk about tabs. If you love tabs,
you're going to love the new Safari. It's easier and more efficient than ever
to work with lots of tabs. So I have another window here, and right away you'll notice
that there are icons and tabs, which makes it so easy
to spot what you're looking for. And if I open more tabs,
then you'll see more of them at once because the tabs get smaller
and use the space more efficiently. If it's a little hard to find what
you're looking for with this many tabs, that's no problem. You can just hover over tabs
and see a nice preview of the page. I'm ready to clean up now,
and that's easy too. I can just bring up the context menu here and close all tabs to the right.
Just like that. We are so excited that
the new Safari has built-in translation. Let me show you. So here on this website, on El Mundo, Safari has detected
that this is not in my primary language, and it's added the translation icon
to the smart search field. I can click here,
and let's translate this page to English. It'll happen inline. And as more content is added, that gets translated dynamically too. Those are some highlights, but there is
so much more to the new Safari. Back to you, Craig. Thanks, Beth. So that's Safari. It's a huge release,
with new ways to customize, big improvements
to your browsing experience like tabs and translation, and even stronger privacy protection to keep your browsing your business. And that's macOS Big Sur, the biggest update to design since
the original introduction of Mac OS X, significant updates to Messages and Maps and the biggest update to Safari ever. But these changes are only the beginning. For years now,
down deep, below the surface, we've been working
on something truly profound. To tell you more,
I'll hand it back to Tim. Thanks, Craig. Big Sur is going to be
a great release of macOS. But that's only part of the story, because today is going to be
a truly historic day for the Mac. Today we're going to tell you
about some really big changes, how we're going to take the Mac
to a whole new level. From the very beginning, the Mac redefined
the entire computer industry. The Mac has always been about innovation
and boldly pushing things forward, embracing big changes to stay
at the forefront of personal computing. The Mac has had
three major transitions in its history. The move to PowerPC, the transition to Mac OS X and the move to Intel. And now it's time
for a huge leap forward for the Mac, because today is the day we're announcing
that the Mac is transitioning... to our own Apple Silicon. When we make bold changes,
it's for one simple yet powerful reason: so we can make much better products. When we look ahead,
we envision some amazing new products, and transitioning
to our own custom silicon is what will enable us
to bring them to life. At Apple, integrating hardware and software
is fundamental to everything we do. That's what makes our products so great. And silicon is at the heart
of our hardware. So having a world-class
silicon design team is a game changer. To tell you more about Apple Silicon and how it will take Mac
to the next level, I'd like to send you over to Johny Srouji at one of our labs
in an undisclosed location. ["I'm Getting Tired"
by Jacknife Lee playing] [song ends] Welcome to our lab. We've been building and refining
our Apple Silicon for over a decade. The result is a scalable architecture that is custom-designed
for Apple products, and it leads the industry in features
and performance per watt. So I'd like to tell you how we got here and what it means for the Mac
moving forward. It all started with the iPhone. The iPhone demanded
performance and capabilities that were seen as impossible
in a device that small. This is where we developed our relentless
focus on performance per watt. Generation after generation,
we pushed the boundaries of technology, which enabled us to improve
performance and energy efficiency, while building advanced
and industry-leading features. Our team delivered ten generations
of increasingly complex and rich designs, always improving performance. In fact, CPU performance in the iPhone has improved by over a hundred times, keeping the iPhone's performance ahead
of every other phone in the industry. Another opportunity for the team
was the iPad. While iPhone chips
could drive our mainstream iPads, we wanted to push the iPad even further. It began with the iPad's Retina display, which demanded a custom chip. So the team scaled our architecture and designed the most-optimized and highest-performance chip
possible for the iPad. Starting with the A5X, we built a line of SoCs
specifically designed for the iPad. We doubled the iPhone's
graphics performance through a larger GPU and a wider memory subsystem. This put the iPad in a class by itself. Compared to the very first iPad,
the latest iPad Pro delivers over 1,000 times faster
graphics performance in just ten years. This is part of the reason
why the iPad Pro is faster than the vast majority of PC laptops. And this foreshadows how well
our architecture will scale into the Mac. Another place where we applied our focus
was the Watch. We scaled our SoC architecture
to optimize performance for the device's unique
low-power requirements, and we built a chip
perfectly suited for Apple Watch. Our SoCs enable each of these products
with unique features and industry-leading performance per watt, and it makes each of them best in class. And we do this at an enormous scale. In fact, adding all of the processors
across these three products, we've shipped over two billion
in just ten years. And we've designed and shipped
billions of additional chips that work together with our SoCs to enable our amazing products. And now we're bringing
all of that expertise and that same focused
and disciplined approach to the Mac. The first thing this will do is give
the Mac a whole new level of performance. Now, when we talk about performance,
we have to talk about power, because all systems built today
are constrained by power consumption, thermals, or both. Among today's consumer systems, desktops deliver the highest performance but consume the most power. Notebooks trade off performance
for lower power, making them portable. As you can see,
normally to get more performance you have to consume more power. When you take a closer look at this chart, you realize you want to operate
in the upper-left corner. You want to deliver
the highest performance at the lowest power consumption. And that's exactly
where we want to take the Mac. Building up on our years of experience designing the world's
most energy-efficient chips, our plan is to give the Mac
a much higher level of performance while at the same time
consuming less power. So, much better performance
is reason enough to transition the Mac to Apple SoCs. But that's just part of the story. Our scalable architecture includes
many custom technologies that when integrated with our software will bring even more innovation
to the Mac. With our advanced power management, we will maximize performance
and battery life better than ever before. Our Secure Enclave will bring
best-in-class security, and our high-performance GPU is going to bring a whole new level
of graphics performance to every Mac, making them even better
for Pro Applications and really great for games. And combined with our neural engines, our chips will make the Mac
an amazing platform for machine learning. And we're bringing
many other custom technologies, such as our video-display
and image-processing engines, that will help make the Mac
better than ever before. So, what does all of this mean
for the Mac? First, we're designing a family of SoCs
specifically for the Mac product line. Second, just like we did
with the iPhone, iPad and Watch, we're going to bring
great technologies to the Mac. This will give the Mac
a unique set of features and incredible performance. And third, we'll have
a common architecture across all of our product lines, making it far easier for developers
to write and optimize software for the entire Apple ecosystem. Ultimately we know
that bringing our SoCs to the Mac will allow us to build
much better products, and the Mac will take
another huge leap forward. Now, a key advantage we have is the tight integration
of our silicon with our software. To tell you more about
how macOS will run on Apple SoCs, here is my colleague, Craig. Thanks, Johny. Now let's talk about the technologies
that we've built into macOS Big Sur that will make the transition
to Apple Silicon smooth and seamless for both consumers and developers. These new Mac systems will be incredible, and users will want their favorite apps to take full advantage of the capabilities
of our custom silicon. And the best way to do that
is with native apps. So of course when we updated
our apps for Big Sur, we built everything as native
for Apple Silicon. And I'm happy to say we have
all of our own Apple apps, including our most demanding Pro Apps
like Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro, up and running as native now, and they'll be ready for customers
on day one. So, how did we do this? We're using Xcode,
just like all our developers will. Everything developers need
to build apps for these new chips is built into the new version of Xcode. To get started, developers just open
their app projects and recompile. The vast majority of developers
can get their apps up and running in just a matter of days. And to deliver these apps, we've created Universal 2. It's a new type of Universal binary that works on both Intel-based Macs
and Macs built on Apple Silicon. So developers can tap into the native
power and performance of our new Macs and still support Intel-based Macs, all with a single binary
for all of their users. Some of the biggest Mac developers
have already gotten started. Microsoft is hard at work
on Office for the Mac. And we've been working with Adobe on their flagship Creative Cloud, and many of their apps
are already up and running great. So let's take a look at macOS
running on Apple Silicon. So here we are on the desktop
that we know and love. And I'm just gonna open up About This Mac. And what you see here is that we are
running on our Apple Development Platform. This is a system built
to support early development using the same A12Z processor currently shipping in iPad Pro. Now, I have a confession to make. This isn't the first time
you've seen macOS running here. In fact, this is the same Mac that Beth and I used to demo
all the new Big Sur features earlier. And as you saw earlier, we've updated all of our Apple apps and they're running great. Of course, a big part
of the Mac experience is third-party apps, and we've been working
with our friends at Microsoft, and they already have Office
up and running natively on our new Macs. Let's take a look at Word. It runs great. Scrolling is super smooth. Everything you do
is just super responsive. Next let's check out Excel. Just as you'd expect,
complex sheets and elements like this map all update instantly. And next let's take a look at PowerPoint. It's using Metal for rendering,
and it performs great. For instance, check out how I can see
all the layers of my slide in 3D. The animation is perfectly fluid. Now, we've also been working closely
with our friends at Adobe to bring Creative Cloud to our new Macs. Here's Lightroom
running native on Apple Silicon. Navigating large libraries of DNG images
is super fast, and all of Lightroom's editing controls
are available right here. Let's apply an adjustment to this image. Well, that's much better. And we can apply that same edit
to all of these images in a single step. Looks great. Next, let me show you the app
I know many of you wanna see: Photoshop. Here is a five-gigabyte Photoshop file
by photographer Stephen Wilkes. Now this is a heavy-duty document
with lots of layers. Now let's add one more bird in there. Not totally comfortable with the level of
social distancing, but let's keep going. And let's check out
how smooth the animation is as I zoom out. Wow. Beautiful. Finally, let's turn to
one of our most sophisticated apps: Final Cut Pro. Here it is running on Apple Silicon
for the first time. Let's play back some 4K video. As you can see, playback is super smooth. And all your filters are here,
and you can apply them in real time. Let's try some color correction. And I can even add
animated titles and lens flare... all during live playback. And Final Cut takes advantage of the unique capabilities
of the Apple Neural Engine with a new feature that analyzes video
and intelligently crops it to keep the most important action
in the frame. But that's not all. Final Cut fully exploits
the system's multicore architecture to let us play back not just one or two,
but three streams of full-resolution 4K ProRes,
all on an A12Z processor. Amazing. So that's a first look
at Universal apps on Apple Silicon. We're really excited to see
so much great work on native apps. These apps even get more amazing
when they're built to take advantage of the Silicon's powerful capabilities. Like its incredible
CPU and graphics performance, a unified memory architecture
and the Neural Engine which accelerates
advanced machine-learning tasks. The transition to Apple Silicon
is also great for developers who've already optimized their apps
for other Apple platforms. The shared architecture
across our products means that their code
will absolutely sing on our new Macs. And there's even more to the story. We're doing some really important things to make this transition
seamless for our users. Now, while we expect most developers
will go native immediately, we wanna make sure that users
can run all of their apps on day one, even if some apps
haven't yet been updated. Now, we've been down this road before. When we transitioned
from PowerPC to Intel processors, a cornerstone of that transition
was Rosetta, a technology that makes it possible
to run PowerPC apps on Intel-based Macs. macOS Big Sur will include
a new version of Rosetta, Rosetta 2. Rosetta 2 automatically
translates your existing Mac apps so they work on new Macs
with Apple Silicon. And this time Rosetta is even faster,
more powerful and more compatible. It translates the apps
when you install them, so they can launch immediately
and be instantly responsive. And Rosetta 2 can also
translate code on the fly when needed, like for web browsers with just-in-time
JavaScript compilers or for Java code. It even handles the most complex
Pro Apps and their plug-ins. Rosetta 2 is transparent to users,
and the performance is amazing. We're also introducing new Virtualization
technologies in macOS Big Sur. So, for developers who wanna run
other environments like Linux or tools like Docker, we have you covered. When you put
all of these technologies together, Universal, Rosetta and Virtualization, you have a system that can run
an amazing diversity of apps. To show you how this all comes together,
I'll hand it over to Andreas Wendker. Thanks, Craig. Let's take a look at some existing apps
running under Rosetta. Rosetta, of course, works great with
all sorts of apps you use every day. But for our first demo, I'd like to
show you something a bit more challenging. This is Maya, the powerful animation
and modeling software running great here on Apple Silicon. I already have a model open that consists
of over six million polygons and, as you can see,
I can fluidly move around in this scene. So let's make it more challenging
and bring in textures and shaders as well. And still, everything is incredibly fluid. So Rosetta works great,
and the performance is simply fantastic. But Rosetta isn't just for apps. It also works amazingly well with games. I can even use a game controller. This is Shadow of the Tomb Raider, a high-end AAA game
that's using our Metal APIs. I downloaded it directly from
the Mac App Store, so it's completely unmodified, and it is absolutely beautiful. Let me jump into the water. You can see
some of the lighting effects here. And as I follow the path,
you can see the game is responsive, it's smooth, and the best part is, you're running
the 1080p as a translated app and an emulation. So these new Macs, they are fast. You can see
some more of the lighting effects here. It's awesome what Rosetta can do
with existing games. Now, as Craig mentioned, many of our users
rely on apps from other environments. So let me bring up a Linux VM
in Parallels Desktop. You can see the graphical user interface
designed for Linux here. But, of course, many developers
like to use Linux for hosting servers. So let me dive down to the command line
and launch in Apache Web Server. And now I can simply bring up Safari and browse the website of the server
I just launched in the Linux VM. Here it is. Now I want to show you one more
type of app to run on these new Macs that we haven't even told you about yet, and that is iPhone and iPad apps. Since they've been built
to run on the same Apple Silicon that we're using on our new Macs, they will run natively,
completely unmodified, on the new Macs as well. Let me show you a few. This here is one of my favorite games,
Monument Valley 2. It's fun to play here on the new Mac. And if I want to catch up on my
guitar lessons, I can use Fender Play. [guitar plays] Or if I want to relax
at the end of the day a little bit, I can bring up the Calm app. And that was just a quick look
at Rosetta, Virtualization and support for iPhone and iPad apps,
giving users amazing versatility for running apps and other environments
with macOS on Apple Silicon. Back to you, Craig. Thanks, Andreas. As you saw, Macs built with Apple Silicon will be able
to run iPhone and iPad apps directly. Starting day one, users can download
these apps right from the Mac App Store, and most apps will just work
with no changes from the developer. With everything we're doing, the range of apps that users
will be able to run on these new Macs is truly unprecedented. Together, we have all the technologies in
place to make this an amazing transition. The vast majority of Mac apps can be recompiled as Universal
in a few days, so users can have fast, native apps. Rosetta 2 runs existing Mac apps, our Virtualization technology
makes it easier than ever to bring other environments,
like Linux, to the Mac, and Mac users can, for the first time,
run iOS and iPadOS apps directly, tapping into
the world's most vital app ecosystem. Now, we know our Mac developers will be
eager to get started on this new platform. So to get them going right away,
we're launching a Quick Start Program. The focus of the Quick Start Program is to enable developers
to make their apps Universal and take advantage
of all the capabilities of Apple Silicon. Developers will have access to
documentation and sample code, forums on developer.apple.com, priority DTS support incidents,
and access to labs around the world. This program also includes
new Developer Transition Kit hardware so developers can get going
even before we ship production systems. The DTK hardware
takes the form of a Mac mini, but one with an A12Z SoC inside. It has desktop specs,
including 16 gigabytes of memory, a 512-gig SSD,
and a complement of Mac I/O ports. Most significantly, it will include the macOS Big Sur developer beta
and Xcode tools. Developers will be able to apply
to the program at developer.apple.com today. We will be shipping units out
starting this week so you can get to work. So that's how macOS Big Sur
is paving the way for a smooth transition to Apple Silicon. This year, we're elevating the Mac
to a whole new level. And it's an incredible opportunity
for developers. I can't wait to see what you all create, and I can't wait until
we can all be together in person again. And now, back to Tim. Thank you, Craig, and thank you, Johny. It truly is a historic day for the Mac. Our vision for the Mac
has always been about embracing breakthrough innovation
and having the courage to make bold changes. Every time we've done this, the Mac
has come out stronger and more capable. And I have never been more confident about the future of the Mac
than I am today. So, what's the timeline
for this transition? Well, for developers, it begins this week with
the valuable information delivered at this conference as well as
applying for the Quick Start Program. And for the customers, we expect to ship our first Mac with
Apple Silicon by the end of this year, and we expect the transition
to take about two years. We plan to continue to support and release
new versions of macOS for Intel-based Macs for years to come. In fact, we have some new Intel-based Macs
in the pipeline that we're really excited about. What a huge leap forward for the Mac
and for Apple. Apple Silicon will bring
amazing technologies, industry-leading performance, and a common architecture
across all of our products. What an incredible day of announcements. As you've seen,
we haven't stopped innovating. We pushed all of our platforms forward
in some amazing new ways. Our OS releases will be available
as developer betas today. And each of them will have a public beta,
including watchOS for the very first time, starting next month. And all of this great software will be
available to our customers this fall. We hope you've enjoyed
this very special keynote and that you're ready
for the big week ahead, with over 100
engineering-led video sessions, one-on-one consultations
with Apple engineers, and so much more. We can't wait
to start working with all of you and watch you do
the best work of your lives. At Apple, we've always drawn strength from the diversity of our global community because we truly believe
when we all work together, we can change the world for the better. Thanks to you all for joining us. This has been such a big day, and it's only the beginning
of a huge week to come. So let's have a great WWDC. ["Daydreamer" by Aurora playing] [song fades] Hey there, developers!
I'm Serenity Caldwell at Apple. Did you miss day one at Dub Dub? Well, let's go back in time.
[WHOOSHING] [CHEERING] - Good morning,
and welcome to WWDC. - iOS 15 is here. Maps got an intuitive
3D redesign. Safari looks new
on iPhone, iPad, and Mac, and we introduced
the amazing Live Text. - How cool is that? - We took FaceTime calls
to the next level with spatial audio
and Portrait mode. And with SharePlay,
you can now share your screen or listen to music
or watch a TV show with your friends all in sync across your iPhone, iPad,
Mac, and Apple TV. - This is where you come in. We're offering new APIs
to start playback that are designed
to fit right into your app's existing video experience. - And speaking of,
now Apple TV sounds even better with head-tracked
spatial audio support. And with Find My
separation alerts, you'll never leave
your AirPods behind. [FIND MY CHIME] iCloud+ keeps
your online activity away from data collectors. App Library is on iPad now, and check out
how to place widgets among apps on your Home screen. AirPlay is coming to Mac, and a big round of applause
for Universal Control. Look how I move
between different devices as if they were one. Look how I drag and drop files. Look how cool I am. We took a big step
with Walking Steadiness. You can share your health data with your family and your
doctors with the Health app, or try some Tai Chi,
Pilates, and mindfulness on your Apple Watch. [EXHALES DEEPLY] Let's get back on track. Later this year, we're bringing
ID cards to Wallet, Home Keys to unlock your home
with just one tap, and say hello to Siri
on third-party devices. - We believe
Siri's most powerful when it's available
throughout your house. - Then we learned
about Xcode Cloud, how to stay in the zone
with Focus mode. - These tools help
reduce distractions so that people can be
in the moment. - How to build apps
in Swift Playgrounds, Swift concurrency, SwiftUI... That's so many swifts. Powerful new tools
for developing high-end games. Object Capture for ARKit
and APIs for SharePlay. - Now we're all looking at the
same canvas to draw together. - Wow, that's a lot of stuff. Not bad for day one, eh? Now, here's a peek
at what happens tomorrow. ♪ "Better Days (Instrumental)"

giants on the privacy front you mentioned ios 14.5 and we saw some of these features kind of start to be announced at dub dub last year but having to kind of opt into data collection it's kind of something that we all do we expect our data is going to be collected but apple's kind of said well you should be able to opt in rather than having to opt out and go through all those settings they've certainly battled facebook on this front a bunch there's been a few kind of barbs thrown tim cook and zuck used to be apparently pretty close but now they are not so close anymore and privacy is one of the big issues between them um so i think what we're hearing for ios 15 is the potential to have a kind of a control panel where you can see all in one spot all your privacy um all your privacy settings in one place and i love this i love this ad like apple does good advertising but the idea of constantly being tracked and constantly being followed was something that we really saw with this ad someone just being uh stalked around town but yeah the idea that you could go to your control panel and you could say all right well is this app taking this information about me that is available on android but you really do have to kind of dig into the settings and that's been something conventionally that we've seen so bringing it to the front and really sort of saying we care about privacy of course apple's business model is selling hardware and services so they don't have to make their money through ads unlike facebook so it's easy for them to bring these kinds of features in but it'll be really interesting to see if we get more developments on privacy today and if that starts to really set an agenda in terms of what's happening in the tech space with privacy kind of as a whole i think that'll be interesting there's a lot of stuff going on there on the privacy front as you mentioned and obviously you know one of apple's big strengths is hardware i kind of want to switch uh switch to that now because that's kind of one of the things that we it's very unclear what we're going to get because at wwdc in the past we have had hardware last year but traditionally it hasn't been front and center obviously being a developer's conference it's all about the software but i as you've been following the macbook pro rumors i want to know okay number one what are the odds of us getting a new macbook pro today and if so are we going to see a new m2 chip m1x give us the lowdown of all of the rumors and leaks that you've been across yeah so mark german of bloomberg who has a great track record was talking about new macbook pros potentially this summer which lines up with this event and as you've mentioned before hardware at www dc is not unheard of it's we've seen the new mac pro there we've seen the other new mac pro there we've seen other macbooks there excuse me but this rumored device would be a 14 inch and a 16 inch macbook pro whether it will get both or one or none that could happen today the odds of one of these coming out today i'm going to say is probably 50 50. that's what i'm going to say so i'm just going to completely hedge on that and say it's 50 50. but i personally think it's more likely than not to happen so 51 is my actual call that we're gonna see new macbook pros now these guys would have new processors inside or systems on a chip these this wouldn't be the m1 and have a lot more cores the m1 has four high efficiency and four high performance cores this would have a lot more of that we would have eight high performance cores and two energy efficient ones and the graphics cores would jump from eight to 16 or 32 graphic scores so we're talking a lot of power in these new macbook pros at a developer's conference it sounds like a really great idea to give the developers something that they can work on and work on really big apps because the rumors are pointing at new mac pros next year so that makes a lot of sense where if you had these developers working on powerful machines and they can really build software they can take advantage of apple's incredible hardware then they can really push the limits next year so i think we're probably going to see something today and we're going to see a macbook pro that developers are going to be excited about and i want to say something that's really important the rumors about this this device could actually bring back ports we're talking about an hdmi port an sd card slot so like if you take a photo you don't have to like figure out a dongle to get your stuff on there so they'd be much more pro like if they're macbook pros that's something that i've really found to be lacking on the pro devices when it comes to apple at this point and patrick you mentioned that too with the iphone pro there's really not a lot of things that delineate the differences but more connectivity more thunderbolt more power is what these macbook pros should be doing the more ports would be amazing because i'm currently talking to you from a macbook pro that is literally an octopus of usbc dongles into other dongles it's ridiculous so i really hope that that is a part of wwdc today but you bring up a great point about bringing out more of the pro features so ipad os is the other big things patrick you kind of alluded to this before with the iphone but i wanted to know you know in terms of the ipad os there's a lot of great hardware there and ios was talking about you know needing to get the software to kind of come on board to to bring it up to scratch to actually really showcase what this machine can do because there aren't really those sort of pro level apps at the moment give us a bit of an idea about what do you think ipad os might bring to the table and how that might improve the experience for the new ipad pro absolutely and i think it's important to remember that ipad os is basically kind of its own flavor of ios so you have to have that ios uh like fundamental like in the middle there to build off of and now that ipad os has to serve both a-chip's ipads like all the ipads until a month ago and this new m1 chip ipad which is running on the same ships as the mac mini and the 13 inch macbook pro and the new imac so right there you have this interesting um span and we'll see that this software has to um has to bridge but then on the flip side you have to think of all the users right you have to think there's people who want the ipad more like an iphone and so remember those widgets i talked about earlier they don't work so great like they don't work like that on the ipad um they have a little like um kind of like a widget stack off to the left side but it would be great to see those widgets come to the home screen and that is one of the mirrors that would see that also more customizations to the ipad's home screen and lock screen um but the other thing we'd like to see though is you alluded to like pro software so like that m1 chip in theory there could be you could run maybe a mac app on it that's completely in theory there's been no rumors toward that uh but our colleague scott stein had a a neat idea what about some sort of like mac mode where you could run final cut pro or logic pro on an ipad versus having um a final cut pro made for ipad os which personally i think would be awesome but i don't know if they're going to do that either so it's just really there's a big unknown but i think the theme we're going to see a lot of this is the overlap between the hardware lines um is getting more blurry it's now time for the software to really step up not only in the sense of security and privacy but also in the terms of what you can do and uh what you want to do to like customize it yeah there's so much potential there and i think today is going to be a big reveal hopefully delivers on the promise of the hardware i want to do a quick time check it's about 11 minutes before the worldwide developers conference wwdc kicks off or dub dub as we like to call it uh we are not re-streaming the keynote here we will be talking and commenting throughout so when it comes time when the keynote does start i'll give you the heads up to switch over to another tab and keep us open as well at the same time hopefully you can keep us company there too and we'll give you all the updates live now i did make a call out on a cnetlife hashtag on twitter for a couple of suggestions for mac os 12 what the name was going to be i've had a couple come through montecito was one i also heard los gatos claire did you have anything else that you uh that people were talking about on the hashtag look i think um i keep on thinking you know of all these glorious names i think did one of our team here mention monterrey we've also heard golden gate as a potential i'm now thinking wouldn't it be cool to just get gritty and be like uh you know central city caltrain station you know um just just to lean into that really hyper local california element um but yeah any more suggestions or any kind of comments on the show we're going to be keeping across that um cnet live hashtag seen it live on the twitters i i got my uh notice that i've been on twitter for 11 years today so um i live there now it's great congratulations congratulations um on the local front we had todd say los gatos we also had a monterey as well i've seen so yeah let us know your thoughts on the new mac os name all right so we've spoken about ios we've spoken about apple's privacy stuff potentially a new macbook pro there are a couple more things you know in the apple portfolio that we might see updates to today including watch os so this might be watch watchos 8 and there are a couple of things that apple might bring to the forefront obviously we're probably not going to see any hardware even though we've seen a couple of leaks about what the new apple watch series 7 might potentially look like some of the things we might see in watch os 8 include new tools for mental health there's also been a leak that a developer has found about an app potentially called mind i don't know what this one is going to be but it does bring to mind a pardon the pun but it was going to be something to do with mental health maybe some breathing exercises and there was also talk a little while ago about using the sensors in the apple watch to give you an idea of potentially if you were having a panic attack or to give you an idea of how stressed you were this is going to be really interesting to see how apple kind of pulls this thread with all the tools that are on board including uh the blood oxygen readings and the pulse oximeter that we saw in the series six i adds i want to know in terms of wearables i know you're super passionate about the apple watch being better than wear os we talked about this when you're on the live show for google i o what do you think we're going to see in terms of developments from the watch os 8 platform well i mean apple has really refined watch os pretty well and they're really leveraging a lot of the sensors to make it more and more of a medical device uh which is very impressive because the competition is way behind in that when you're talking about the idea of that mind app i really think that is something that they would spend a lot of time on because it's one thing to go okay why do i need this device because again it's another nice idea to have to have a smart device another another device to have you got your phone you get your ipad you got your macbook do you really need another apple product but if it's actually helping you with your mental fitness that's a really big deal so they already have that stuff with breathing and giving you a little reminder to get up and move but if they actually have a method a stress-free method to help you be stress less so that'd be impressive but like if the phone i mean if the watch is going to simply just buzz every time you're stressed now you've caused a new stress machine so i don't know if that's going to work so they have to have this really really intense intelligently designed otherwise they've created the problem that they're trying to solve so i would think they're going to really bank on not just the physical fitness but mental fitness with this revision to watch os that's so funny you say that because i absolutely had the same issue when i was testing the fitbit sense which does use a sensor on it to actually detect the changes in sweat to determine if you are stressed or your body's response to stress and it made me even more stressed because i saw on the watch that it said you are stressed and i went mm-hmm i know i'm stressed help me and uh then it just said do some breathing exercises maybe this is like a chapstick thing where uh apple will uh force you to use that stress tool and then you have to pay to opt out of it so like hey we're causing the stress but we're going to solve it once you pay 199 more a month let's see i really want to work that's part of the services i i wanted to jump in quickly and talk about blood sugar monitoring monitoring and it might be something that might need new hardware but um you know patrick you talked about it in your curtain raiser video uh as well sort of this would be such a game changer i think the stress and the breathing is really cool but um the idea that you could monitor your blood sugar on your wrist without having to do a pin prick test without having to have a you know one of the i guess what are the wearable glucose monitors or one of the ins insulin numb pumps i think that would be a game changer like i have low blood sugar and being able to just go like oh yeah okay i'm about to spiral and crash my watch is telling me that would be so huge i think this is something that maybe fewer people would use but that's the one that i'm secretly if they introduce that to an apple watch i would buy it tomorrow absolutely without a doubt stress is probably something though that far more people would use um but you know i could tell you about why your blood sugar levels are linked to your stress levels and we can do that offline afterwards it'll be a really fun chat for you guys i'm stressed waiting out waiting for it now i know please send us the medium post or the zoom link at your convenience so there's one more mystery element to today that we might see something on so obviously apple has tvos it powers the apple tv but there has been a job listing for something that references home os now this one is interesting because this is the first time we've seen home os as a name listed anywhere now is this going to bring in maybe tv os is going to become a part of it homekit is going to be part of it to make a central hub for all your devices maybe there's something that's being worked on that we've seen leaked a little while ago or talked about from bloomberg which was a kind of a home pod and facetime camera box does this sound appealing to anybody i i don't know what to think of this rumor okay i would speak up here um i would say first i think if you go back to the source which is that job posting it there's a big argument to be made that could just be a copy and paste error because it mentions like all the other os's and then they deleted the word homeos which was mentioned twice in the posting and replaced it with homepod so it could honestly be that simple of a mistake um but let's just pretend it's real um you have to wonder yeah how does that product look and how does it fit into the current lineup because you do have a hub that can do all those things it's called an ipad um but i wonder if they would integrate something like something more like ipad mini sized and then would it run ios or is this like its own thing like you said through like a tv os and i just like to add this last little wrinkle that uh we might actually see very rare that this could happen but the t's of the images had like code on people's eyes and and glasses and and apps um and there is this persistent rumor of like ar glasses um but in order to have hardware you need software to run it so could there be a tease of ros so we have home os which you saw in the job posting and people are speculating that there could be reality os or ros as well what do you guys think i feel like i feel like we talk about apple's augmented reality vision with these glasses and you know many moons ago it was like 2021 or 2022 is the year and now we're actually here uh are we ready to see it today i love that that thought process that you just had patrick because i i if it is as simple as there was just a little typo in the job ad that would be kind of hilarious but yeah as i said we've been talking about ar for a while uh i asked do you think that this is a possibility we're gonna hear more about this potential new realm of apple glasses today i don't think we're going to see the glasses unless it's actually ready to hit the market apple is notorious when it comes to not showing off stuff unless it's ready i mean the iphone was in development for many many years before that showed up same thing with the ipad they definitely don't want to show up with a half-baked product and honestly the original apple watch in its original watch os was a kind of a mess to the point we had to revise the whole thing i think with apple's push into ar which is very very uh noticeable in its phones and ipads developers are already getting a way to work with this kind of interface whether apple has a device that's small enough and is power efficient enough that you can wear in your face and doesn't scream oh my gosh you look like a massive dork uh that's that's the real thing is apple doesn't want to have an uncool product you saw that the home pods the the massive airpods pro not the pro what's the big ones the big ones max is that what it is i always mix these things up but the massive ones they got made fun of for the carrying case like they have to they're really cautious about what things look like so unless the product is ready and i don't know how they could possibly shrink an m1 chip and have all the battery power and not it burn your face i don't think we're going to see it today but we might see more ar just in general well we'll hope fingers crossed and hope for the best now we are one minute out before the keynote is supposed to kick off so i am going to say goodbye to our friend patrick holland who is actually going to go and watch the keynote live and cover everything so make sure you stay tuned to cnet.com you will see all of patrick's stuff miss you patrick don't leave us but i know you have to thank you so long i love this like patrick thanks for joining us all right as i mentioned it is just on just before 10 a.m pacific or 1 p.m eastern apples keynote for wwdc worldwide developers conference 2021 is about to kick off we are not allowed to restream the keynote so please go ahead and open another tab you can go to apple's youtube channel you can go to apple.com and watch the keynote live there we will be talking and commentating throughout the entire thing so when things get you know a little bit boring or maybe there's some talk that you know is not that exciting or a topic area that you're not that into come back we will have some jokes some fun talk and everything like that to keep you company all the way throughout and you can of course keep tweeting us on the cnet live hashtag with your guesses for mac os and any other comments or questions that you have throughout the show so i'm watching the apple keynote right now and it looks like it is kicking off it's just started so make sure please go across and open up the keynote in another tab we'll still be here don't worry you're not going to offend us if you just keep another tab open but we're still here um so it looks like they're starting off with a developer kind of i guess it's like a sizzle reel of developers talking about all their ideas for wwdc and there's a curtain opening i feel this is like very i always love narrating these because um there's now tim cook getting out of it no it's not tim cook someone getting out of a delorean or a food yeah this video is apparently apple asked developers to come up with the video and so that's what they're pitching they pitched tim coming out of a delorean and they had an actor so now they're trying to show us more versions of the video that they could be showing us what's the worst this is cute it's kind of like a yeah you've seen a couple of like animation shows i remember bob's burgers did something like this where they like crowdsourced and conan o'brien during the lockdown did a crowdsource show where it was like if you were doing a version of this what would it look like which is uh one a way to get people involved two an easy way to do something during lockdown and three great way to outsource your video production i mean maybe we should be doing that get people to like impersonate us and sit in our different squares and boxes in this call or is that just going to end terribly that would end terribly wouldn't it yeah i mean i think it would go well for the first the cartoon representations [Laughter] i think i think the the clones would work well for a little bit but then they would take over our positions and then what would we do we would have to fill in for other people right so then it just keeps going until the very end the last person has nowhere to go hey one thing we didn't talk about in the pre-show and i want to get your bets on whether we'll see it today we um is the is the lebron sneak peek beats that we saw do you think we'll see those today do i mean i as you did a video on these and you kind of um you talked about all the little specs being revealed as these gosh there's a lot there's a lot happening in the stream right now just random zazzy dancing but um what's your verdict on those on those beats okay so if so lebron james if you guys don't know there was an instagram posting about by him actually and it looks like he has a pair of unreleased beats earbuds they're not any beats that you've seen before because they don't the giant ear hooks they are not air pods because they don't have stems they're it's very specific are we going to see that today i'm going to say no i think it would take away from uh apple's general vibe with this because beets is such a consumer-facing brand and also how apple's been handling beets has been very strange because usually apple buys a company and then eats it you never hear from them again this is a very unusual thing that beets still exists so i don't believe we'll see that today but i bet it would show up pretty soon this is cute they've got a whole bunch of little ar emojis in the um in the in the crowd that tim cook is waving to that's that's very sweet i did like the um craig federicki and tim cook actors they were doing a bit of a jam session so i thought that was pretty good uh looks like tim's on stage talking to them emojis oh it's so healthy that is pretty cute that is pretty cute i have to say do you think that emojis will be on for the whole show like will they be cheering and whooping for like developments or they're just just for that open because if it's a whole for the whole two hours or whatever long this is going to be that would be a nightmare you don't remember all the standing ovations that would happen in the in the old days and how long these were added and then we'd start to develop like a love for our different characters in the audience like oh i love beanie guy and i love you know i mean i love that we can banter about this because normally the whole first five ten minutes of wwdc is just like we've really brought people together this is really about uniting the world with software and it's uh we normally don't see any kind of hard reveals until uh a couple of minutes in so banter banter banter entrepreneur cam here we go but hilarious as you were saying that the the language that tim cook's mouth might as well might as well be been what you just said it was just like industry and togetherness i was like yeah okay that's wonderful prepare the question to be interesting they're not talking about industry and togetherness and the uh the huge court case that they had with epic in uh in the in the circuit court or not the circuit court the federal court um this there's always like what's been happening in the news but let's not mention the awkward fights we've had with other companies that's uh always interesting to see i want to see um how am emoji does a standing ovation being a bodyless object that would just float up just floating in space even further kind of like the like the older yes thank you to me like when they bowled or something they had no no legs they would just kind of float so like all right i could see this unless apple's big announcement today is like memoji bodies maybe that's what's happening today we're giving the option today that's the art play memoji is in your real space with bodies oh the man the hair the legend craig federighi is on stage i love to see it i love it but they didn't okay so the crazy transition wasn't a crazy transition so much as federici jumped out of a wall like he came through the wall because i was thinking the last bunch of apple keynotes we've seen like these wacky transitions between scenes not so much this time well they're sort of playing around you remember the first um the first keynote we you know it was pretty basic and simple now we've got arm emojis uh mamoji's like actually in the audience and these these kinds of transitions we are very much in the second year of the pandemic now they come up more creative ways all right ios 15 staying connected and finding focus using intelligence and exploring the world now i think so one thing i will say a little bit different in terms of timing so if one of us uh is ahead of the other then uh yeah we'll just keep up to date but yeah claire sorry yeah no i was just gonna say um i i've always watched on youtube.com apple uh which has been quite behind but i think i'm at the same point as you on my stream and it's through the apple.com so i've got that in one tab and i've got uh us in another tab and then i've got me in the real world tab um it's in the real world tab number three that's what you've called convention so you call your office it's just the tab there we go yeah so i'm i'm interested to kind of see yeah how much is how much is going to be like new and revelatory with ios 15 because some of the some of the big updates were announced early for last year's dub dub with ios 14 but they kind of didn't roll out until sort of six months later that the privacy ones be a good example but um i want to know what we'll get like quickly and what what's kind of rolling out you know straight away well we can start playing right now we're getting an update to facetime calls uh fredericki's talking about how how with draining they can be and they're introducing spatial audio so it's more like you're in the same room so you're not just getting all the audio like from a single source in theory that people are in the room they would obviously their audio would be coming from different sides i believe the airpods and airpods pro uh somebody correct me if i'm wrong on the youtube chat because i'm sure you will uh that they do support spatial audio where you can hear where people are in a room or just audio around so that that actually would make it a little easier to handle some of these calls because it is a huge mental drain uh for those who don't know if you ever feel like you're tired of all the zoom calls it's more tired than normal there's a reason for that yeah so special audio is supported on uh airpods pro airpods max and also now with the announcement of apple music with spatial audio support as well which there actually is an announcement at 12 p.m pacific today so it's not going to be part of this keynote but there is going to be a little bit more information about that so that's also something interesting to see that this technology is coming to facetime so obviously yes to be able to hear this you'll need supported headphones that do have spatial audio support which is the airpods range but do you know remember that kind of creepy not creepy eye tracking feature of facetime that was announced as part of ios 14 last year i actually think that is that is pretty good and creepy but good i don't know if any of you have had a chance to try it out but i have had comments of people saying why are you looking at me how are you doing this um and feeling like they were much more into it oh and it looks like we're getting portrait mode finally so this is portrait mode in video on facetime calls yeah so this means that potentially for the io for the iphone 13 maybe we'll get portrait mode video recording this is something that patrick and i have been speaking about for a very long time so yeah that would be your first time yeah this is this is interesting um i'm really interested in talking it oh sorry go lexie no no you could you continue i was just saying it was going to use probably maybe the lidar sensor and the the um true depth camera on the front of the iphone to achieve this i think it's really interesting that they're trying to make the experience of video calls they've obviously recognized that that's been a huge thing this year and while we'll probably get off our zoom meetings and kind of relish the return to normal soonish i do think that the convenience of the call like the video call isn't going away and so they were talking about you know the portrait mode uh the spatial audio also being able to schedule facetime calls so that's really starting to eat into the into the zoom meetings uh you know you can schedule a zoom link in your calendar but facetime for me has always been like a i'm just going to quickly facetime my mum now this sort of seems to be pitching it as a bit more of a uh still a social tool but being able to use it in a meeting sense or being able to kind of schedule them ahead of time i mean they use the movie night example but that seems a really obvious way to take some of the things that have really worked with zoom and kind of bring that over to the facetime ecosystem um so that's i think one of the huge things about schedule they also mentioned that you could take the calls in a browser so if you use an android device if you're using a laptop that's not a mac you can use facetime that's huge that instead of it just being like apple to apple device you can really use this for a lot more things like you were talking about with zoom this is platform agnostic which is enormously different than apple in the past because it was also mentioned during the whole epic trial how apple refused to allow imessages outside of apple devices because they wanted to keep people locked into those devices this is really interesting because you could also have the idea that you're using an android you go this actually works really well you might actually want to go the apple way because it works well i'm that's i'm just kind of surprised and excited that cross-platform stuff from apple that's wonderful yeah i mean it's it's awesome also because the bottom line right there yeah finally um my my parents and my in-laws will be saying let's facetime you when they actually mean a whatsapp call or a zoom call and they'll actually be facetiming me on my android phone now so the ability to uh to be able to move between platforms i think that's something yes apple's got a walled garden yes it works really well but maybe it's a way of converting people if you can kind of bring a couple more people in i mean if we see that with the watch today you know we talked a little bit about whether the watch would come across and have kind of interoperability with other devices aside from an iphone kind of breaking out of that needing to be chained to an iphone that could be really cool so apple starts i guess converting a few more people that could be a way to do it with you know features like this yeah this share play technology which is basically you know bringing music into the call cueing up music playlists for people uh it's an it's an api which is actually great uh it looks like there's going to be a lot more features potentially can come to it you know sharing your screen uh doing things like playing music underneath the call or switching out to messages this sounds really interesting i think zoom should be scared zoom should be really they've also added a lot of watch parties uh watch party style things with sharepoint you can watch movies together you can start watching on your phone send the video over to your apple tv they're talking about partnerships with disney plus hulu hbo max twitch tick tock paramount plus like so you can start watching stuff together instead of going how do you do watch party in uh disney plus how do i do it in hulu is there any magic way apple is trying to make that experience different that's always something that apple has done really well it's not so much about these revolutionary pieces of technology although they've done that in the past it's this uh improved lifestyle because it's while we were all trapped and we wanted to watch a movie together to do it was very difficult like who's got what how can you set this up do you have this service apple's trying to take the sting out of that that's a good idea because yeah i mean i don't know i was starting to boogie the idea of starting to boogie am i like 70 years old but yeah i was starting to think of like the idea of being able to have watch parties listen parties you know uh kind of making it a bit more social i think that's the element that's been missing um from the video calls this year and you know a sense of fun you know that might be nice it might be nice to bring back in so oh a fun trip down to joshua tree hmm interesting you know i think there wasn't actually a joshua tree i don't know i think there was a mac os a while ago that that was the rumored name and i don't think it actually ended up being the thing so maybe i'm always getting so confused with the rumored names and the actual names oh it looks like you can quickly switch between a photo gallery view in messages and scroll through photos rather than having long long scrolls up and down of photos there's rumors of apple adding more social networking elements into imessages right now looks like we're starting to see some of that like when you talk about the improved galleries that you can share with each other in imessage so as as we discussed in the pre-show apple and facebook obviously not getting along right now they're not thrilled together so apple famously really bad at the social network space by the way they've tried ping they've tried that weird music social network in apple music but they shut down that too so this would be a great way to get apple's social network up and running because imessages has a really loyal following so we're going to have to see what else they're going to keep adding to this but i think it's going to get a lot more uh bolstered in features yeah that was the rumor before today that imessages was going to be really getting a lot of updates and that would be one of the key standout features so i mean yeah photo sharing is a big part of imessage right you know what are we what are we sharing when we're going onto that kind of platform and having everyone in the same ecosystem so kind of smoothing that process out um would be great so yeah looking at that um that's what we can see on screen right now so the ability to kind of sync from multiple places bringing images over to to the library and i guess yeah maybe trying to make imessage a bit more user-friendly and bring over some of those whatsapp style features um and and bring that into the imessage space would be yeah i think though imessage is going to be i don't know maybe because i'm an android user imessage i'd like to see kind of incorporate elements where it was not so insane to get an imessage from someone if you're on android you know if uh lexi you laughed at one of my texts the other day you like did a reaction and i just got a message on my phone that says lexi laughed at your message here's the entire body of the message i was like oh i forget that i message things like that there's just like little weird moments where it's not quite i suppose that's the beauty of it they want to have that amazing um ecosystem and the amazing platform so that you say well you know it's just not the same on android maybe i should get an iphone because all my friends have iphones you know yeah group chats with anybody who is on android and then people who are on ios it's just a mess as you said those reactions just don't work anything you know some people who are on imessage end up having their breakout threads and then people are like excluded because they can't watch even video sharing and mms sharing is messy too between android and ios which you'd think wouldn't necessarily be an issue but it still is so it's good to see things are kind of coming a bit bit together but i'm actually surprised so far that this has been a very consumer consumer-facing intro to wwdc rather than focusing on kind of developer showcases or you know more technical stuff way up the top so notification is the next thing shareplay what they did mention the api there so i'm sure i'm sure that with share play where they have that ability to for you to sync up things they probably want a lot more people to make sure their apps are compliant with that so that way if you're going to share a video through let's say this is not a good example like instagram like they could use the shareplay api you can do that but like they have the massive partners already with disney plus and twitch um but yeah like patrick right now is probably through the moon because it is the notifications time like lex was mentioning so it's supposed to be clear supposed to be a little easier i i'd like to see this i've been android guy i think notifications are still annoying on both platforms i also wish there was a clear all option apple if you can hear me right now clear all would be wonderful on an ios device which i don't know how that's not possible um but let's see what new things are coming up with notifications it looks interesting they're going to be using um i know claire's super excited but don't die please don't choke i know um it looks like so obviously it's going to be used on device recognition to work out how you interact with apps and sort of surface the notifications in order of priority which is interesting to see because things like siri suggestions are kind of like ah hit and miss so to see if that actually is the usual stuff surfaced on top will be interesting it looks like you can really force through some urgent messages if you have do not disturbable focus mode turns on it looks like we're seeing big like blue eye message bubble being shouted front and center please look at my message i have an urgent request for i don't know whatever you need to have an urgent request for call me pizza okay so it's a do not disturb or a focus specific focus mode i see what that is this is really hard to watch and talk about it at the same time they're talking about having focus and we're splitting hours right now we're trying to listen and talk at the same time but yeah i like the idea of a focus mode especially like i know when i want to work like there are certain apps that need to come through and certain apps that don't so like i get like an update from seamless like i don't need this when i'm trying to focus something but if it's a text from my wife that's way more important the fact that dnd can have those issues where you don't get the most important stuff versus getting like everything so there needs to be a medium and yes i know you can um allow certain apps to be they can still notify you with dnd on but i think apple's trying to make it even simpler because again it's all about lifestyle it's about enjoying your time not necessarily like what setting do i have to fix to make this happen yeah and it looks like it's going to have the same location based uh suggestions so like oh you get to the gym do you want to turn on focus mode it's similar to how the location based uh you can set the triggers for location based to do not disturb um and actions that you can run through shortcuts so it's interesting to see that it's going to be similar with focus focus isn't in the focus mode on android there is a focus mode too isn't there i believe so but i'm just saying i wanted to say that in the focus mode it syncs up on your devices so if your watch is set to focus your phone will do the same and your mac will do the same so you're not setting up a whole bunch of stuff again apple trying to get you into all of their stuff at once so that's another nicety if you are fully invested into apple you don't need to dig into settings per device that makes it a lot easier to do what you want to do in this case focus i'm misguided sip of water that just went completely down the wrong way and i almost died i'm on camera so i'm here um i love all the stuff that you guys are saying this is all awesome i really like the idea of just modes for your phone it's so simple because we have it on all the time basic idea another they've added in the ability to scan whiteboards and take the text right off of it and send it into email these are features that i use other apps for if they build it into the apple camera that's always a good thing i will also say apple's cameras are fantastic and anytime they decide to integrate technology everyone seems to pay attention you remember how popular qr codes got around this pandemic time for menus they go oh if you have an iphone it's really easy and if you had android you did kind of just look at your sideways like do you want a paper menu it's like no no it's figure out able but apple again trying to add another feature to the camera it's interesting you see how well it works hybrid google lens so you can yes he was highlighting the um highlighting the phone number in the background of the image and then using the recognition to basically pinch in and call that particular phone number that's i think the secret and the future of ar right there it's like not the ability to see like an octopus on your living room floor or whatever you might kind of experience on other ar platforms but the ability to like walk down the street and see a shop front and just kind of say yeah okay maybe i'd like to eat there later on today recognize the storefront bring up the menu you know bring up the phone number those kinds of features so that'd be um that'd be really cool and actually kind of usable rather than gimmicky you know what lex i think this is turning into google lens like they're talking about being able to take a picture of something and know what a dog breed is or what flower that was uh that's really unusual for apple and also the ability to translate text on the fly and there's a couple of languages that are supported at least the native languages for live text you know english chinese french there was a whole list i think it was about seven or so so it's good to see that it's not just english that this is going to be available for um but i'm sure so now using san francisco as being able to sort of highlight some text in your photos as well so the san francisco is the example uh you have a receipt a handwritten note or something like that and then you can basically look up those details on the fly so it's not just a live image kind of augmented reality style it can be post capture as well and sharing locations within contacts and basically seeing oh so this is a sort of an overhaul of the of the contacts it looks like as well in in the ways because the contacts tab in ios and the contacts app is very basic so it looks like it's going to get a little bit more interesting and a bit more capable with that spotlight feature the youtube chat is blowing up about this is google lens this is literally google lens you've copied and pasted google lens so yeah but if if it works as effective as google lens that shows the power of apple because that's not that is not easy to do all that um taking that data of an image and then using that to create other information that's been notoriously difficult even for google and they specialize in this whether apple can really do this we're gonna have to see how well it actually works right because like it might it looks great in the demo but how is it going to perform in real life it could be like a total joke like and we also saw very very old joke we saw with ios 14 with widgets right everyone said google's had this forever google's had this forever which yes true but also like it's kind of nice to see those features come to other platforms like if it works there's a reason it works there's a reason it's popular you know that was always a kind of a bug bear for me with iphone that i couldn't kind of do that personalization and customization now i can so you know if there's i guess it's not really you know it's not really stealing because these are they're just using kind of neural networks or machine learning or the ability to kind of take the smarts they have in other divisions and apply them to something consumer-facing with photos and then say to the devs okay do this use this feature use spotlight and kind of play around with it we're seeing a picture of the visual lookup that was a breed of dog i would love to be able to use that for people does random take photos and i'm like who is this no don't don't do that that's not a good idea although we've gotten a lot of california references with joshua tree and san francisco do you think they're just playing with us with that mac os name like here's joshua tree like you were talking about before here's sand here's san francisco here's the golden gate bridge the golden gate yeah i i do i do like this thing they're talking about now which is using apple music to set music and beat transitions in photos i don't know if either of you have used kind of the if you take a lot of photos in ios and automatically kind of like google photos will create video moments for you from a montage of images set to really tacky songs so the fact that you can now integrate music of course from apple music into those and search for particular tracks is useful but it still won't beat the google photos okay i don't know if either of you have taken a lot of photos of dogs or your dog on google photos but it will automatically create a video of your pet or your dog set to the most amazing barking music it's literally dogs barking to a melody it's really really funny and i don't think apple photos is gonna match that um spend a lot of time in that feature yeah someone spent a lot of time taking photos of dogs yes yeah i think some of those are a bit hokey those video compilations you know google tells me i have a new a photo memory or a new video compilation and never really look at them um i don't know it just sort of seems you're right i think the music is often a really big tacky part of it um that's that's interesting though with apple music being brought in if you want to share it i guess are there rights issues wow i love taking fun cool new features that everyone wants to share and then saying what are the copyright implications i think yeah i mean if you try to put up a post if if you want to post it on i guess i message its own social network it's fine if you post it on somewhere public and you might have a problem because they used imagine dragons as their example now i'm pretty sure if i decide to put up a music video with imagine dragons behind there and i didn't bother to ask permission i might run into trouble because that's also something claire you might say you're bringing us down on it but it's really important that if you want to be able to share your stuff and then it disappears because it's a copyright strike that stinks like you really want to be able to share these real things with real people so if apple hasn't figured a way to clear it to make sure it's all simple and your shared memories all disappear because everyone's being litigious that would be really really kind of a bummer but also like tick tock is teaching people that music is just shareable and takeable and like you layer up and you kind of add you augment your change um you know i could do a really interesting post structuralist reading of the internet age but like younger users are kind of saying well this is what i do on other platforms so why can't i do it here you know so maybe it's a bit of borrowing borrowing again there like what how are people using their phones how are they interacting and apple also has a lot of leverage with its own music service good what's the big news that's true well big news you can now use your phone in actually basically put your house keys your corporate office pass and also your hotel keys in wallet so you can use technically apple pay your phone to basically get into lots of different places i know this is huge because i don't have to carry like an office pass when i go back to the office or you can scan your driver's license you can put it in you can put a lot of stuff in wallet now so is it using is it using rfid technology because a lot of those hotel cards and um office passes are rfid so maybe it's kind of that's the kind of handshake happening behind the scenes i mean apple to discuss a way to have a digital computer a while ago so i don't know thanks lux i wasn't sure if it's rfid if they're using nfc or they're using a number of different protocols together to create that handshake that's something that i'm sure the developers are going to dig into later today they also showed a driver's license as well oh sorry go lexi oh that's right with the delay means we're all talking over each other we're all so excited no um so khaki does use uwb or ultra wideband in the phone uh from like there's you know certain cars that are coming out later in the year like bmw and so on that will have this car key and we're seeing it on the screen now uh this car key technology so it's gonna be this is sort of a bigger part of the uwb question because when it was announced in the iphone 11 pro and pro max like two years ago now almost it was kind of like this really cool technology but there's no use case for it so it looks like this starting to you know provide some more really interesting ways in which we can see this technology have really good use cases but the weather app is getting an update everybody like that's important because we all know that ios the ios weather app app is rubbish it's absolute rubbish so now it looks better and thank you they bought dark sky remember dark sky this amazing application that was available for android and ios they killed the android version just despite us all because i'm also an android user uh and and then they kept dark sky for itself and it was still its own independent app on ios i have it on my i have an ios device downstairs too so like i test out devices all the time so dark sky is beautiful and fantastic and the like lexi was saying rubbish is a is very kind that's a kind description of the regular apple weather app which has been like the same since it was introduced since ios 2 like or iphone os what it was called back then so like it is it is astonishing that they haven't bothered to merge dark dark sky with weather until it looks like now looks like we're sort of seeing some of that together which makes a lot of sense if you're going to take an app you might as well make it yours i want to touch on something they're talking about maps now and the improvement to maps and we all remember when apple maps first came out and there was a lot of dissing it on how it compared to google maps but um just something briefly that we didn't touch on was the wallet featuring the ability to scan your driver's license and the ability to use it and have it tsa authorized so that is going to be really interesting uh there's a big move in the united states to bring out this feature called real id which is kind of a verified driver's license that's safe for travel um i wonder whether this kind of technology i mean there's a lot of talk about vaccine passports right now and vaccine credentials it probably wouldn't be brought in with that straight away but you know digitizing your identification documents so you can just have them on your phone super super interesting and would it be something that would roll out i love mark p's driver's license there you know yeah i live in the state of goat like what that doesn't look like a real driver's license but um mountain goats yeah i think it would be really interesting to see how this feature is used and as more talk of kind of having vaccine credentials on your phone is it something that we could see in future wallet updates that would be interesting but um i just wanted to touch on that because i find it i find it really interesting how those kind of features are rolling into just being on your phone yeah there's somebody in the chat room about peter sanchez i didn't miss that tsa thing he's talking about apple's asking for your id facebook never asked for my id card so apple which has done a lot of work trying to bank its reputation on privacy this is something that is really important it's one thing if you have your credit cards in there which is already a bit i won't say sketchy a little bit fearful because my phone's got my credit cards in it can people just come by with an nfc device and pick it off now apple wallet has been pretty much a success i haven't heard any horror stories when it comes to people stealing credentials off of it the li the layers and layers and layers of security they're going to be on wallet to protect this is important they did say in the keynote that everything would be encrypted i believe that the information this is a guess i didn't catch it during the show but i would believe everything is on device and nothing is being sent back and forth unless it is if it's going back and forth it's got to be encrypted because there's no way on earth it's going to be passed from one machine to another without there being a layer of security yeah you you talk about credit card details um you know you can change your credit card you can cancel your credit card you can't change your date of birth very hard to change your name uh you know very hard to change your height so some of that personally identifiable information especially dmv they don't want to be having any data breaches around that so um yeah it's it's funny though saying oh facebook never asks for my driver's license you know as someone who's just done a video on facebook privacy and how to stop it tracking you online hey check out cnn highlights on our youtube channel to see that video um i think what's interesting is the opt-in is always there for apple so it's saying do you want to give us this do you want to put your driver's license on here is the information here is how it's being stored the criticism of facebook is it's not necessarily always making it obvious what information they collect they might not ask for your driver's license but they already know a lot about you from what you're doing online from how you interact with your facebook account so it's kind of uh opt-in versus opt-out and kind of you know the information that we're directly taking from you versus the picture of you that we build up and we kind of glean from your behavior so i guess that's an interesting comparison there but you know it's always up to what you're personally comfortable with some people might not like the idea of having their cards on there on their phone which is which is fair enough completely it's everything it's a bunch of apple maps updates and it's yep yeah airpods time i'm excited because i i thought the spatial audio announcement was going to be part of this 12 p.m briefing but it looks like we're getting some information and updates now and this is not the first time that apple has updated the airpods and given us new features like retroactively because there's actually hardware in there that we didn't know existed that happened when we saw spatial audio introduced with the gyroscopes and the accelerometers that no one knew were in the airpods um conversation boost sounds like you can hear more easily people talking to you so accessibility is a huge push for apple and the airpods actually do have a lot of existing tools that you can use to make audio improved but this is interesting i like this a lot i'm looking forward to trying this out this is exciting and it's it's something useful not like a fun you know there's fun gimmicks which we all love but i think that ability to use the audio and make it an accessible feature is um that's what i what i love to see so what we're going to say is oh i was going to say that using the airpods as a hearing aid device is a brilliant way to do it because when you've got something jammed in your ear already so it's already harder to hear but to have the microphones actually make it simpler to hear somebody in front of you that makes you know these nice earbuds something even better to have like you were saying it's not just a whiz-bang feature like you were saying claire it's it's something really useful and it looks like they find my implementation has been improved because it's been a little patchy if you do lose like one airport or something they have to kind of be out of the case and so on so it now looks like they're going to be sending a i guess a secure beacon so it's going to be leveraging that find my network that we saw kind of revealed with the air tag announcement so potentially if people it looks like if people pass by you might be able to find them even if they're not like located within bluetooth range of your phone so that's interesting too that could be a big game changer though what if you're like our colleague dvb and on the day you get your air pods you drop one down at a drain like a storm water drain and you can see it you know it's there i mean that's the other thing that's involves i believe you stuck a piece of gum onto the end of a coat hanger and got it out that way so you know there is the high-tech solution of the find my network and then the gum and the coat hanger solution i think ios 15 will have a feature that uh they actually show you an emoji pointing and laughing at you for losing the airpod and then i have a link to the apple store how to buy another one that may be that way although but there is i didn't mention the ios stuff they did mention new outfit options from emojis they actually did make that a little slide is a little extra on this uh card next to us right there yeah so we're seeing all this summary today which is uh for music which is good because that we didn't really know exactly when we were going to see that launch there was no date apart from june so it looks like we can try that out today exciting i do like i'm a big fan of when airpods get more features i'm not going to lie as someone who does use them a lot this is this is actually really some useful stuff here which i am happy to see oh ipad os who's laughing at me i'm laughing in the background because of of the youtube chat someone said why is everyone disappointed what happened it's like the the chat's very disappointed in the amount of stuff we've gotten so far i'm i'm not personally disappointed but apparently this is a big letdown to a lot of the commenters in the youtube chat which is totally cool everyone's entitled to their opinion these are just like i said ios and i like all of these things that apple does at this point they're really really mature so you're just going to get small revisions over time so i don't know if we're going to see anything that's going to like blow us away exciting like focus mode does not blow you away exciting but in real life it's gonna be really useful yeah as people who are i guess maybe people in the chat who are watching this you know as power users what are the features that you think were missing from this announcement specifically around ios 15. i think you know there's a lot of stuff that you're exactly to your point i as that you know it's not new in general but it is new to apple and especially kind of branching out a little bit more cross-platform i think is probably the biggest part of this ios 15 and facetime update and but maybe people who are all in in the apple ecosystem and every single person they know is on ios or mac don't care about that maybe it's just people like us who are very cross-platform with people all over the world using different ecosystems that value that i'm just interested to hear your thoughts so do let us know in the chat yeah you're right lexi i think you especially you test so many different devices constantly moving between things seeing what works what doesn't um there are a lot of people that have just when they see my android phone they're like what is this device you know show me how your people work it um so yeah i think there's a lot of people that are very happy just staying in the apple world and love how much that all kind of connects together so i'm interested in the perspective there and we're seeing on on screen now ipad os widgets so craig federighi caught an ipad that fell from the sky that was um something i immediately seen the gift again this guy is just a walking gif machine um but yeah he's talking about how you'll be able to personalize your ipad which i think our colleague scott stein is probably very excited mr ipad himself he's always uh talking up great features so yeah the app library the ability to kind of customize your home screen customize how everything works which is cool to see because it's uh some of those features have sort of been missing on ipad and if you're going to make it a truly um you know i guess a functional device and multitasking those kinds of things that's what you really want to see and it sort of starts to look a bit more uh a bit more laptop-like i guess in that respect so you know setting up a home screen although i i am confused why it's taken a whole year to get the same app library as it was on ios 14 and organization to ipad to me that seems like a no-brainer that should have come to ipad os shortly after ios 100 i feel like if i was an ipad i'll be like why did i why am i waiting until now to get this i should have had this last year did you say if i was an ipad lexie did i say if i was an ipad uh i would fall from the sky and craig fredericki would catch me how about that um all right so multitasking okay multitasking go is sorry oh yes it shows apple's focus why didn't the ipad get this right away because ipad is not their focus it was they were trying to get i believe everything moved over the m1 that's the real focus get the max in line with things getting the ipad pro and m1 is even more interesting and then you have like you're getting the nice features back like yes you can put widgets on your home screen which is ridiculous should have been an ios and ipad os a long time ago but it's it's good that it's finally there getting some of the features from iphone being able to hide the screens like if you've got a bunch of home screens with a bunch of apps you can just turn them off you don't need to have them up all the time which is kind of like how your laptop works you don't have all your apps up in your desktop because that's crazy uh and right now like they're talking about the multitasking the one the weirdest things the weirdest thing about the ipad is that it's essentially a redefined pc right everything is built from the ground up again of like how do we do windows we don't do windows we do slide overs and we have these split screens they don't actually just do flat out windows we can have as much junk up as you want we just i mean ios recently i don't know when files came out but actually having a file browser was unusual so like with the m1 and the ipad pro i i'm really curious if they're going to be showing more power in this yeah it's nice you can have split apps and stuff and but what else can it do there's an m1 in there it's got like a heart a monstrous like engine in there and it's like oh yeah we can have two apps up at once like that's not exciting what else can you do with this and exactly i feel like for people who have invested in the hardware to only now kind of get this software that's not showcasing the power of the m1 is a bit like why did i spend so much money on on this uh right now and this is sort of the multitasking capabilities i'm getting including the ability to have like the mac os dock it looks like now called shelf which kind of shows your your apps and stuff it looks very much like the dock i again like coming closer together but still very separate uh you know this is a little bit of a confusing one for me that shelf feature uh i don't i don't know what to make of it yet and the notes app getting i wonder whether again why it took them so long i wonder whether like stuff like multitasking that's a it's hard to kind of see the cell of the grunt of the ipad because it feels like something that you're already doing on your laptop and it's like well shouldn't it just do this but i guess that's the kind of we've all had the experience of an older laptop or maybe i've got a really new mac for work but my macbook air my personal laptop is really getting on now and i move i spend most of my time on my work laptop but then i go back to my old laptop and i see just how hard it is to have multiple programs open or lots of tabs up so maybe it's like it feels like it should be this seamless but you know that does take a lot of a lot of power under the hood but i guess you know is it going to be a selling point are people going to go kind of say like this is enough for me or you know when that's something that should just feel like it's already there yeah it is does this look like the galaxy note to you or does it do yeah that's exactly what i was going to say it's exactly the note line i have i have an ipad pro i have a galaxy note 20 ultra the fancy one i was trying to figure out how do i write a note really quickly on this you have to find an app open it write it and then you put it away which sounded ridiculous because on a galaxy note you just pull out the pen and then it's like hey you want to write a note they're adding this now so basically the ipad is becoming one big galaxy note which is weird but kind of cool i'm i'm the weirdo who really loves the pen interface even back in the old days so like um it it's it's one of those why wasn't this here before like what you sold this pencil for a hundred dollars 100 bucks this this is crazy i mean because here's the thing with the rumors of the galaxy note potentially not existing beyond the this year and now it's like oh maybe people are going to be interested in it again because the ipad pro now does this i wonder if samsung's been hilarious potentially well i think that the notes the note story was that they wouldn't have a new one this year because of the chip shortage the samsung was essentially worried that they wouldn't be able to give the craziest hot like amount of power to this device because the notes always like insane like you can have tons of like space you can have tons of ram you can have everything you want in a portable device and i think it's really neat uh the rumor was that they would come out with one next year so they would skip one year which would be unusual but then also i think the rumors are of a foldable device i don't feel see anything about foldables here that would be kind of funny but this this is really unusual that i'm actually discussing android stuff and galaxy stuff at an apple thing so i can't wait to have the rage hit us in the um the chat because anytime we talk about apple and android's like what are you doing i don't do that because i don't know who talks like that but they do and yes thank you for noticing my aw shirt everybody [Laughter] i mean to be fair we are talking about that because right now we're talking about a note app rehaul overhaul and a weather app overhaul for apps that have existed since the dawn of the iphone and the ipad so i think we can talk about uh you know there's some some interesting tweaks here that the decisions to do this now rather than earlier uh is interesting but translate coming to the ipad i didn't even know translate wasn't on the ipad it just goes to show how much i use my ipad doesn't it um well if you're using your ipad to translate stuff or you're holding it up like with the camera feature is that you're talking about it you're like just actually it seems a little really no the actual just translate app itself yes uh okay swift playgrounds are actually stuff for developers now finally i feel like yeah developing okay we had an api and uh yeah so maybe it should be a bingo card every time something that's dev friendly is mentioned you know instead of something consumer facing i suppose all these features like they want to sell it to consumers because they know how many of those people are watching and then kind of have the devs kind of build up and build it from there but yeah it's um it's sort of it has been a very kind of consumer focused event but yeah now they're talking about building apps on ipad so that's um very targeted right and yeah again surprised it took almost 50 minutes to get to this and i guess it does go to show that the breadth that uh the scope of wwdc is kind of changing especially over the past year which was you know i guess apple's big first event that was done virtually and you know it was the first free one so pretty much anybody can attend not necessarily only developers who have to fork over a lot of money for a ticket um but now it's it's open to everybody and everybody is watching this developers consumers and so on so it does make sense that they're starting with this kind of you know less dev stuff and now kind of leaning into that in the back end but a lot of updates to products uh that you know consumers are already owning which i think is one of apple's big strengths is that not just abandoning kind of products in terms of the first year of their life cycle like things like the airpods you know the airpods pro are now a year almost a year and a half old uh the original airpods and the airpods too you know some of these features will be coming to those as well the original airpods was 2016 or 2017 i want to say someone can find the exact date or correct me i'm sure if i misspoke but yeah interesting to see that there's not leaving those products behind but we did we see anything about ios 15 compatibility i might have missed that because oh you mean like the list of phones it goes on too yeah the list of phones so it's like if it's iphone 7 and onwards like people were speculating or if six uh if the six and six s uh might also be getting upset i doubt it if someone was asking for success compatibility in the comments they were saying please bring it to the success i don't have any power but i'll ask them the six got cut off last year and the ipad air from 2013 got cut off last year i know this because i had an ipad air from 2013 or something like that and you were right lex it was 2016 that the airpods came out but it was december so like it was pretty close to the end right so 2016 was when the original airpods came out right fredericki doing moves like he's preparing so we're now i i'm kind of i'm seeing a bit of stuff about um privacy in mail which maybe is a bit of a call out uh against gmail which you know famously free service provided by google but uh you know has had people raising concerns about privacy in the past but they actually what was interesting they said uh calling out that individual emails might have a kind of so-called invisible pixel that's tracking details about you and that's interesting because uh facebook's web tracking feature was called literally pixel wasn't it so um yeah it's this is going to be a bit of a here's what we're doing on privacy and um this is why we're better than everyone else yeah and this uh the whole preventing centers to see if you opened an email on the mail app that's gonna have huge ramifications for uh you know newsletter companies and people that that depend on kind of open rates and things like that imagine if you could just like peak like almost what uh ios used to do like a peak and pop kind of thing we had that 3d touch functionality you could see those messages i don't know if that actually activated to see if you like opened it or not but interesting that now we're kind of seeing somewhat similar that you can effectively block that recipe sorry the sender seeing if you've opened the email or not that's going to have big ramifications later on down the track a lot of people probably panicking now who work for like email marketing and newsletter companies being like uh oh well i mean that's what happened with ios 14.5 when apple announced that they were bringing in those changes that meant you had to opt in to certain data tracking um google changed like some major elements of how it's how it's ad tracking worked so it's sort of it feels like this can be an agenda setting move sometimes where other other companies and you know other players will start to say well you know if we want to keep the iphone market or keep the ipad market apple market in general we're going to have to change these features about our product so yeah it can be interesting how much they can kind of set the direction um right now apple's talking about siri and they're going to do on on device speech recognition that's a really big deal because instead of your information going from your device to the cloud and back which also slows down things and obviously introduces elements of uh your data being taken in between the transmissions with on-device processing it's faster that makes it a lot easier and also your data isn't leaving your device which is again apple really digging into their privacy section right now they also talked about an app privacy report it's supposed to be really easy to see what sites are are being pinged from different apps so i'm really curious if the general public are going to really care about this i mean a lot of people use free services all the time but are they going to notice that 900 sites have been pinged will that make them freak out or they go oh that's just normal so i'm really curious how this is going to suss out and that uh you know the on device processing in regards to just doing basic tasks like device control so they showed basically making requests without being online so switching between apps opening and starting timers switching dark mode and so on it's going to be interesting to see how fast this actually is because siri in the past with those sorts of requests and hasn't always been able to do all of those hasn't been particularly quick so to see if that will improve speed by being entirely on device um and the devices that it does support is going to be going to be intriguing to see um but it does remind me a lot it looks like it's another challenge that needs to be done it's going to be google assistant versus siri again to see which one is faster and which one actually that gets it right i think you set up a new video for yourself right there lex i know i'd watch it so i like doing that i liked it i'm gonna watch that video so do it so this is interesting they're talking about being able to add contacts uh recovery contacts and legacy contacts to uh your devices so that if you forget your password and get locked out you can have a friend or family member be your recovery contact and uh digital legacy is something we don't really talk about because it's not something many people want to think about what happens to their devices after they die but i mean your phone is your everything right now so what happens um you know for family members that might want to be able to access information photos you know those kinds of things that's quite um that's quite interesting that's sort of part of the privacy piece as well i guess but all kind of icloud based right and so we're getting a new version of icloud all of these people will have to be icloud users um oh yeah plus everything's plus what is this kind of everything can i just reduce the price please can they just reduce the price of the basic icloud packages not make it i'll put up it from five gigabytes free to like ten i'll take ten like please like that five gigabyte free just goes immediately just yeah five gigs in 2021 what is this like i can't i can't live with five that's basically like two 4k videos that i'd shoot that's it okay they're they're explaining a feature if i cloud plus called private relay this sounds like almost a vpn so that means that the data that you're sending out the request you're sending out versus what's being sent out is going to be very encrypted so this is interesting how they're re essentially rebranding vpns because anytime i say those three letters a lot of people's eyes just glaze over because it's like what are you talking about nerd but the idea that your data isn't uh as traceable that's a big deal so you're not getting those targeted ads all the time when you're using something like this this is icloud plus a feature that's coming to i guess icloud this year and hide my email oh this is fantastic you can just generate emails oh that is really cool uh that's a really cool feature especially so many sites uh i'm not mentioning any names but so many sites were you know ask you to sign in to get more features and it's like so how about how about no how about i can filter yourself so that's where the data breaches happen like it's not necessarily the big companies it's not necessarily a net banking or you know a big company that has your email it's probably more likely uh the discount coffee card that you sign up for online that's going to not quite have the tip top security so yeah being able to kind of generate a single use email would be amazing i think that's a great feature i see that being really handy in day-to-day life i think this is an extension sign-in process uh okay because you know if you sign in with apple it does create like uh it can you can have the selection to either hide your email or create uh or send the email to the developer or the sign-in platform i always like to hide it but it's now interesting to see you can make burner email addresses so burner email apps probably going to be scared a little bit um but it appears only with this icloud plus subscription and there was a note about video does not count towards storage uh i only just saw that line so i need to do a little bit more digging into that because if video doesn't count towards your storage i'm all in because that's what i think that was about storage i think that was about security cameras they said some of that home kit video oh a security i think that makes way more sense why that wouldn't count towards this but also they did mention that the pricing is not changing on icloud so you're going to get these features i call icloud plus another syllable for me to mess up at the same prices all right so my dream is not coming true thank you for clarifying i'm i'm here to question yourself onto health now i know [Laughter] that's your tagline i as actor here to crush your dreams that's that's all my business cards it's true if you see me it's linkedin i'll endorse you for that i appreciate that i'm gonna i'll set that up right after this uh keynote's over but yeah they are talking about health right now they're shown off the apple watch so hopefully we'll find out some more about watchos as well with this yep fingers crossed ah i mean it is interesting that the there's a lot of research studies that apple has been doing around heart health and and cardiovascular studies so it looks like this might be kind of giving us a preview of some of those studies because they have been going on for a few years now so let's take a look and see a little bit more about this is talking to a couple of cardiologists it looks like or now something about your vision into reality i think this is a little sizzle about seeing some coding with ios developers about some some tools that they can have maybe on the apple watch this is the thing again it's interesting how much the health stuff is um this health stuff has been such a you know i guess we always thought about it before but there's nothing like a global pandemic to make you really start wanting to know about your health and um yeah i remember early on there was a lot of talk about uh pulse oximetry and those kinds of features to see whether you had high enough blood oxygen levels or you know it's um it's amazing how much the conversation has pivoted and how yeah we we have this greater appreciation appreciation of um of you know health workers and the things they're doing and how suddenly actually maybe i do want those features on my watch maybe i want that information accessible straight away but yeah so i think this this part now is just kind of sizzling us through you know yes a sizzled kind of show us health features and the stories uh that are kind of you know building up out of people using the devices the feel good stuff which we always see at these events you know joe and jane really loved this feature and it's a well i mean there's lots of stories about the apple watch uh you know full detection uh ecg and so on actually providing those critical pieces of information for people that actually ends up doing does uh does save their lives so three new features well as you say like fall detection let's talk about mobility and uh balance issues and gait impairments so there we go it's it's like you uh you you brought that on lexi you're immediately leading us beautifully segwaying into the next topic of conversation on the health front yeah so i mean full detection has been present on the apple watch for a couple of years now and and so you know if it detects the fall and you remain motionless it can call emergency services or an emergency contact or both and it looks like the mobility metrics is improving so mobility metrics has been that kind of name has been included in uh the health up for a little while and it looks like we're now seeing a little bit more in terms of a breadth of what it can do so walking steadiness is the next one uh and there was there was a metric i'm trying to remember what it was called uh i totally forget i'm blanking on the medical name but it does it is like a collation of all of these kind of metrics to kind of give an overall picture of your health but this is specifically around mobility now and double support double support time i never remember that one so a bunch of these metrics are going to be used to give you a more i guess a more holistic picture of what's potentially going on yeah so that heart movement and that heart study i mentioned uh has obviously collected a lot of this data and it looks like we are now seeing some of the the fruits of that now to see your walking steadiness hmm is it okay or is it bad okay so how many people are immediately this is obviously designed for uh you know for the health of uh maybe less mobile people but am i cynical and imagining that people are immediately gonna you know go out for a night on the terps and just try and test their walk standing the score in their phone i mean that would be happening i reckon this is going to be aggregated though so it's not necessarily going to take like just one night on the town probably won't affect it too much your age between you know 20 and 35 you probably just had a big night i reckon rather than potentially something else going on but i i as i interrupted you i'm sorry about that well yeah thanks for translating thanks for translating what a terp is i was like what does that mean night on a terp like is that are you using night on a town not on the beach i still don't know um yes is that is that maybe that's california saying i don't know it but big night out they also showed that if you were having issues with walking and that apple's noticed that your gait has changed or anything like that they actually provide solutions like here are strengthening exercises you can do to help you it's not just like okay this is bad good luck it's actually okay there's something going on and you can actually do something about it i feel like those solution based things are much better than just simply notifying you that there's a problem so um this i think will be it's gonna be something that's gonna be really useful considering how long we are living with our devices like if you're stuck on iphone forever like you're gonna be getting all of this data as you age and you can find out how you're actually holding up over time because you have these tons and tons of sensors on you all the time with amazing processing power changes in technology moving forward the amount of information and and suggestions you can get over time has completely changed i think uh brian cooley called this once thing uh instead of getting like a snapshot of what of your life when you go to the doctor you have this constant all these meters on now you can really see what's going on minute to minute and that's that's a huge change in like how long has the iphone been around since 2007 so this is a massive change for people living with these devices and what's interesting is that like a lot of doctors will tell you that if you do like spot readings in an office you know a lot of people have it's not necessarily indicative of an overall picture of your health it's just representing that point in time so if you have that aggregated data over a period of time especially when you're not in the office which a doctor's office which does cause a lot of people anxiety then it is probably going to be a little bit more accurate again interesting to talk about this in light of medical devices because i don't know if anything we've seen any indication of like fda clearance for anything because this is all based on the iphone at the moment and obviously i think there's part of it to do with the apple watch i think there's a lot more threads to kind of pull out here and also now we're seeing information about doctors being able to see a lot of this data on um on a portal of their own so there's a lot there's a lot to dive into and this keynote is really fast there's a lot to catch up on a lot to kind of keep up with it's it's just coming at us i don't know how you are failing out there but there's a lot it's hard to interpret it's like when we were we were talking about one of the topics and then it was like we just had a brief conversation on it and then maps was done and it's like okay we're on to the next thing so this is yeah this is moving quickly there's a lot and i think when you take out the applause from the crowds or people walking on and off stage it just means that they can literally just edit down this uh presentation to be super fast but now we're seeing um now we're seeing carer a lot alerts pardon me carer alerts for families so the idea that maybe if you're caring for an elderly relative you could get updates on their health metrics which is um incredibly helpful because someone who is maybe not in the best health they're not necessarily going to be the person that's digging into all those quantified self metrics um you know that they're not going to be the person that's uh always always switched on to what's happening on their iphone maybe your elderly grandmother isn't you know on her iphone every day so having a family member do that would be um that's a really that's a really basic but handy feature so i like that i can imagine this also going the other way with like kids who are overly paranoid about the health of their parents a bit literally an alert oh your resting heart rate was a little high mum uh what what did you what'd you do like you know text message every single day like i saw you when what was this little raise of elevation or you know so i think it kind of works both ways but in terms of remote monitoring i think there's a lot of great potential here i can just see a lot of people becoming real hypochondriacs not necessarily the people that have potentially the issues it's more like maybe the kids yes i think you're 100 right there and i was just playing bingo don't worry like i was a bit excited having a flutter on the horses it's fine okay it's watch time when you see kevin lynch you know it's time to talk apple watch he's that guy that sounds like like he's very very chill and calm he's like the guy who like won't take the last piece of birthday cake for himself he just seems like that kind of dude like federighi will buy you another cake this guy's like no no you can have mine better eagle will catch the cake from the sky and then present it to you [Laughter] yeah that's right now we've got the meme of falling ipad falling cake all right so maybe we're going to hear about the um we talked about you've seen the breathe up in the past but now potentially uh okay so enhancement of the breathe up to slow down and be mindful which i think a lot of people are a lot more aware of their mental health this year and uh trying to stay sane so this kind of this got a little bit of slack no that's not the right phrase it copped a bit when this first came out like oh you need your apple watch to remind you to breathe but funnily enough sometimes if you get that little alert to kind of tell you oh time to step and just get away from my desk or time to just take a moment to slow down very hard to kind of remind yourself to do that in the moment so having a device that sort of tracks that and watches it for you i don't think it's the dumbest thing i was initially pretty cynical about that when it came out but these kinds of devices is anyone who's been in the midst of a really hectic day you know having their partner come in say maybe just take a walk around the block you know maybe your apple watch could do that for you now what's funny is samsung i believe had the breed stuff for the oops sorry go ahead oh no i was just moving ahead to the sleep stuff but you you go talking about the breathe up oh yeah so yeah back to the breathing thing samsung's s4 was inspired by the breath or something like that and everyone's like this is the silliest weird thing this must be maybe it doesn't translate to the us who's worried about this what's going on it's like no it's actually kind of important they also apple did introduce right now a new app called reflect it shows you like a little something to read like think about someone you love and think about them or something like that it said something as a note so they have the uh the breathe app and now reflect app so if you want to just make take time out and just remember stuff and be grateful it's not it's not a bad thing will everybody use this all the time i don't know but it's it's not like it's gonna mess up there's think about something you love to do and why it brings you joy i need to hit the begin button okay that's i i feel like i don't interesting i'm gonna use this every day i'll take this one you gotta trademark that although i think she's got her own paper yeah all right there's two new activity types there's a tai chi workout and also a new pilates workout uh for more call based stuff it looks like and now fitness plus which is that service that kind of you can get free with the apple watch and then it's a subscription i think ten dollars a month after that got some new workouts coming uh you know strength based training um high in high impact and i never get what hit is i can never say it but it's getting intense that's the one thing to do thank you training and i like the idea of new playlists okay yeah i like the idea of being able to i mean i am already rocking out to lady gaga when i'm exercising so uh bringing me some specific playlists that i can kind of you know jam out to i think everyone realized just how much it's important to when you're self-guiding exercise the last year was huge for that i stopped going to the gym and suddenly had to become my own personal trainer turns out i'm not great at it guys i need lady gaga as my motivation uh thank goodness for chromatica otherwise i just don't know that i would have left the house this year done any form of exercise so um yeah that's interesting maybe kind of be being a bit more they've kind of seen the popularity of peloton and you know those uh those guided workouts and then the kind of workout self-guided workouts is a there's a whole like genre now a genre of content so um yeah it's cool to see those features come through probably the biggest reveal of the watch stuff so far is that the photos app is the most used watch face i i did not expect that i did not expect that at all i uh i'm a big fan of the animoji and me emoji watch faces personally uh just like looking at the dinosaur um but the interesting part here is that you can now use portrait mode photos taken on the iphone and it's going to be able to use uh basically segmentation processes to make the subject stand out this is this is intriguing to actually change the position and make that subject pop so you have that blurred background effect and your subject can kind of be a bit more front and center she's showing a demo right now and then sharing watch faces is something that we saw on watch os seven so they're just showcasing that ability to be able to share them with you know other contacts now um i don't share watch faces at all i don't think anyone needs to see my watch face or maybe no one cares maybe that's just an indication of my friends but yeah who's who's doing the sharing not entirely sure it's uh seems like a specific use case but you know hey if that's you then you now have that great little feature to use we're just seeing the watch faces with the portraits on it and one of the nicer things is it's not like the clock the actual time is slapped on randomly on somebody's face if we put up that picture again you can see that the clock is actually behind some of the subjects it's actually integrated better into the pictures if you just take a look like even the top left there you can see that the person's baseball cap or its head i can't really see but it's kind of blocking the time a little bit so it's not like your beautiful photos are getting ruined with a giant clock slapped on it they're trying to integrate that which makes it a little bit nicer to look at it's a small detail but like you're right i think it's just really nice like cool looks like a magazine back in the day it does it looks like when you know vanity fair is covering up the the logo of uh the actual masthead that's a that's very nifty but obviously using the processing in the background that's happening that's kind of creating that foreground and background and kind of slipping the time in in between that's like maybe my favorite feature of today i am easily swayed by one of them into the home it's home time uh also can i just say multiple timers on watch os like what again what took them so long was that time no as far as i'm aware i've never been able to do it well there we go okay home home here we go here we go just interesting while he's on the air force one yeah well well air force one one while the fed uh talks about all this i just think it's interesting some of those features that are coming onto the apple watch kind of bringing the watch away from the dependency on the phone um that's interesting to see you know kind of being able to text uh you know contacts bringing a lot of that onto the device so you don't have to have it being a kind of a uh you know a pepper's ghost of your phone um weird reference but sure because the score i like that i like it roll with it you could send that to apple marketing right now yeah i should so homeowners are talking about getting in unlocking your door um okay are we gonna see a homepod with a screen that's the question probably not okay yeah something something i've always wanted to see from homepod is actually happening right now you can actually ask the homepod mini to play something on the apple tv i have no idea why this wasn't a possibility before it seems like if you have these all these devices that talk to each other why didn't this happen before they were but don't get excited yet this won't be out to the fall so if you bother to pay 150 for your apple tv and like a hundred dollars for a home pod they can't talk to each other until the fall for whatever reason to totally get the developer versions of the os right potentially if you want to put the developer options of everything on but then you know you proceed with your own risk uh okay so it looks like you can they're showing um being able to watch and basically sync at the same time so the punch line of the show drops at the same time because we all sit and watch ted lasso and and wait for the punchline well we've all done that thing when we're sitting on an airplane when you're sitting on an airplane and you time the start of your movie with the person sitting next to you with your friends sitting next to you i don't know if we've all done that thing but maybe i'm just a big loser um but timing it so you're not laughing inappropriately at this slightly long time you've got to do that you've got to you've got to whip smart that writing on ted lasso so you've got to make sure that you're capitalizing on that punchline timing i support it now ted last was a show on apple tv plus which is available on everything these days by the way so if you have an android tv it just came out last week so android tv has apple tv plus at this point if for some reason you want to do both that's i have not seen it yet i have an apple tv i think i even have a subscription because i bought something and i have never seen an apple tv show um are they good i'll give you the lowdown you should probably watch the morning show and you should probably watch ted lasso to keep up to date everything else is probably a bit of a pass unless you're particularly into the subject area uh that's you know those are kind of the things that i've watched decent everyone loves ted lasso i'd say it gets much better i didn't like it at the start but now i do but now the homepod mini can actually play audio and sync with your apple tv so i this is this is also big uh big news too that's again like like why again before why this wasn't a thing yeah personalized playlist yeah yeah um all of you bring us your to third-party devices now that's new yeah i don't know yeah it's like okay i mean it looks like it was talking to an echo b good oh i was just saying the series functionality has been very very limited compared to other assistants uh and yeah i wanted to see this is again i'm curious to see if developers are going to be interested in this given it doesn't do all that much or it doesn't have the capabilities of some other assistance um i interrupted you my apologies i asked continue yeah so they're talking about matter right now which i believe is a consortium sorry consortium between i want to say google samsung apple amazon or maybe samsung might not be in that but like it's the big ones they're all together that way devices work a lot more seamlessly together they're discussing that matter is going to be a part of ios 15 so that means that you're going to have improvements when it comes to talking to your devices through siri so that's a big thing one of the things like lex was mentioning siri is behind a lot compared to amazon's assistant i'm not going to say the name or google's assistant because it just it just doesn't work with as much stuff so home kits kind of behind too so once this thing is working together siri is going to get a lot smarter faster because they're basically in the same league with amazon and google yeah when you start to bring siri to more devices it's like it's not really doing much now because it's pretty pretty walled into to one kind of space but if you can have it on third-party devices then suddenly people are interacting with siri more and more i'm guessing they're sort of taking the learnings from that and you know devs being able to roll it out into different kind of ecosystems that's kind of interesting but yeah i've sort of uh my experience with sirius a lot of people say no i didn't mean to i didn't mean to say your name i just i said seriously seriously movies and there is apple detection it looks like apple car no no i just saw i saw so last time to bet on the names i say santa rosa you got joshua tree lex did you have your pick on the names uh i think i liked either mariposa or um monterey i think those things are good sounds nice boring and going with the ones that they well it is nice i'm going with the ones that they kind of supposedly did register as trademarks or names so i'm not being particularly creative oh here we go let's go come on monterrey aquarium if it was called montreal bay aquarium i'd be pretty happy it's that hokey thing where they have the photos of what activity they did to find the name this is the first time i've been at the front of the stream that i've had the fastest this is i'm always five minutes behind it's always yours which is all you watch eyes and eye going to tune out now um you got this i got it all right uh here's everything i'm saying i'm in the future everyone so i can tell you the following features are coming to mac os monterey they're talking a lot about uh photos here um imessages coming to you i'm trying to read and talk at the same time and that is a skill that i didn't necessarily develop in school um i okay did you discuss they just share plays come to mac os as well so if you want to be able to have watch parties from your device you can do that your mac you can do that they discuss the focus mode that's also like i've mentioned before as cross device so if you want to focus on your iphone it'll tell mac os and vice versa so that's really cool uh i'm not in the future i'm just slightly behind so what they're talking about now is a feature called continuity because they're saying that the mac the ipad the iphone are all powerful devices but you need to be able to have them connect with greater speed and precision uh and it's a feature called universal control we can use a single mouse to move between devices a single mouse and keyboard so that's a kind of a cool concept so your mouse can move from your mac screen and then swipe over to your ipad i guess as a secondary display or a secondary device bringing those two closer together so that means i don't need a fancy schmancy super expensive apple smart cover whatever the heck it's called that floats the ipad i can just use the janky one i have if it's got universal control on it that's interesting moving it across and the cursor's on the ipad from the mac it's like a virtual vpn set yeah exactly there's going to be a meme that comes out of this somewhere there was so many nerdy tools i used to use to do this like if i wanted to have one mouse and keyboard on different machines you'd have to install a virtual vkm i think it was called it was a virtual keyboard monitor uh keyboard and mouse that is and now it's like apple's like i was gonna put this in this is like a super nerdy thing i don't know how many people are gonna use it but like it's it's actually oddly i'm enjoying this because like this is the this type of stuff i would do to make my devices work together and i'm like yeah you know this is going to work together we're just going to fix it for you all right sounds great well having that kind of handshake happen seamlessly in the background so you don't have to think about it is um that's a kind of feature i'm now oh i was i i flew too close to the sun i started buffering um but yeah now he's got three devices how did craig fredericki get so many macs and ipads together impossible it's like he's connected or something being able to drag and drop files between devices i don't know like that's something so seamless as someone who's got 1400 devices and i'm like taking a photo on my phone i need to send it to someone really quickly and just yeah being able to move seamlessly like that it's similar to like what movies show what technology to be like just send that to my screen just flick it over there this is the kind of thing that people wanted to do and like then you've seen it in sci-fi this is what apple's actually doing like okay if you have all apple devices it's pretty easy to move these things around i am very very curious one day if this will lead us to go like let's just open that app on my ipad because they are running the same processor and that's just a pipe dream at some point but i could see that happening at some point because they're all essentially running the same hardware at one point this will all be in that world where they all run the same stuff so maybe more apps that could be shared and more files and it's basically every device becomes your device which is uh yeah if a utopia a future that i'm looking forward to well brian who's running this stream for us today behind the scenes he described it as iron man technology so the ability to just like just it's like why can i not do that if they're all in the same family they just don't give him a flying scooter a flying i don't need rocket boots i need to be able to move files by going put that over there yeah the fanciest thing about iron man was when peppa potts was walking around and what was clearly a cold night with no shoes and i was like man they've got that like underfloor here in their house they're so fancy iron man is the richest wow um so universal control back to back to apple not my wish list from the iron man films um yeah i think this is i think this is a pretty easy sell but maybe it was needed it needed that bedrock of all the work that um apple was doing to kind of bring you know mac os closer to ipad os closer to ios those ecosystems to be able to talk to each other it sort of seems simple on the front but there's a lot going on behind the scenes so now that those things are more aligned we can get these kinds of features like universal control and we're talking peak productivity and automation so yeah shortcuts coming to mac os now mac os has had applescript automator in the past they've always had these these things that were really kind of nerdy if you wanted to have things automated on your behalf like if you wanted to set an apple script to go off to open a browser at a certain time using ical you could do that in the mac shortcuts is on ios already supposed to be an easier way a more graphical way to make this happen automated was something in the middle a little bit more uh these little plug-in things you'd move around instead of it being all text based like applescript creating these automations and having them on a mac it's interesting apple always they always try this they've i don't think it's ever really succeeded i don't know anybody's like i'm a big applescript person i love using automator those are like really hit my mic really really niche kind of activities i'm really curious if the shortcuts because it's from ios bring it to mac os is that going to bring into the mainstream or we're going to see tons and tons of interest in this or is this one of those things of like yeah it's just there like we don't use it well how many how many people on ios do you use shortcuts who are general users not power users who are dedicated to automation but people i think i've used shortcuts probably three times and uh i that was just to showcase how to do something and then after that i haven't needed to use it before and it's not as intuitive as one might think it's much better than say scripting something yourself but i don't think that for most users i'd say 19 90 to 95 percent of users probably never even touched the shortcuts app they've probably never even downloaded on ios mac users though are different so i think that there's more it makes more sense for it to exist on mac um especially because now you can import those automators into shortcuts as well as craig was just saying there so again curious to see actually who actually is going to use this i don't know if i would now we're talking about safari yeah i can't say i've been a huge user of it um i'm just interested that they're talking about safari now and uh talking about power efficiency and privacy so i know that some sometimes a complaint about chrome that if you've got loads of tabs open it starts to go slightly haywire um so they're saying that you know it's going to be a better experience in that respect and also just a more private experience so all right awesome this is like there's a new design sorry there's a new design for safaris a little bit cleaner they've also introduced tab groups which just was added to chrome you could probably get those as extensions before it's supposed to make it a little bit cleaner the groups can they remain in like a closed drawer on the left you can open it up and have it the idea is to keep it uncluttered which is really important when you have a ton of projects going i know anytime i'm researching something i end up with like hundreds of tabs so like i don't use safari other than on ios devices i don't really use it on macs i don't use it for that kind of thing but i mean if they make a better browser to make a better browser so let's see how it does and you know little graphical things like the tab taking on the colors of the page that you're looking at yeah it is interesting though i mean i have played around with groups uh grouping on chrome as you mentioned i as and i just like the chaos too much you know like i think it's great have these options of folders but it's just a way to hide the chaos and so i'll never actually open and then close those tabs you know at least if there's like 100 open and it's all visually cluttered my ocd will get to me so i'll be like i have to close these because it i have to finish consuming the content or take what i need and close it because otherwise it looks way too cluttered but i think tab groups will be very useful for most people probably not me because i like the chaos what can i say you embrace the chaos i love it i love this uh yeah true chaotic evil life that you're living in this world but yeah like it's just like a little it's a little feature i don't know if it's enough but it's like not enough but it's just kind of a simple update but it could be something that is an absolute game changer in terms of productivity but it's interesting though that these little features all get their own like really special moment and you're like that's something i will use oh no i'm not going to use that at all but that is i suppose wwd say it's just all these kind of disparate things coming together and then you go hold on the apple watch face puts your photo in front of the time that's huge whereas i'm like tab groups yeah give me give me every tab is a sliver so i can't even see the logo anymore i'm just like it's a memory of which one's where you know that's that's the kind of true power move i think the safari is actually coming to ios and ipad os so we're going to have tab groups on those devices as well they're also syncing up so if you have the tab open on one it'll show up on the other device now that is another one of those things we're talking about just the the complete uh ease of use you're talking about you got three different devices it's really easy to lose some like where did i put what did i open that did i open on my laptop or this other thing this makes it a little easier and yes other devices and other browsers do have syncing abilities so i'm not like completely i'm gonna get raked over the calls on this one yeah i know that's a thing but apple's building it into their default browser and the ability to have those on mobile the tab experience is going to be different so it is going to be very much catered to one-handed use so the tabs are going to appear on the bottom rather than necessarily having to go to that multi-app multi-tab switching view in safari or turning your phone landscape to kind of see all your pages it's now just going to be like a quick swipe through kind of like how you would flick through apps on ios it's going to be similar with tabs in safari yeah that's useful you know for you know laser extensions are coming to yeah sorry extensions are coming to ipad and io and ios so if you have like i don't know an ad blocker it actually would go to safari it would go there like that there's extensions for native safari now and in ios and ipad os that is a vehicle think about it the example they used was um honey which is one of those uh shopping coupon code extensions you know how many times you sitting on your laptop shopping versus how many times you're just sitting on the sofa using your phone and just like shopping when you should be which should be watching your tv show um or grammarly was an example where you know if you're if you're typing something out on your phone so having that on um ipad os and ios is that's really nifty i i'm about that and airplay to mac so if you wanted to send something for your phone to your your mac your actual laptop or an imac you could use that as another display that's there are third-party apps for that so they're gonna probably be very irritated that apple's built it in but that's what apple does sometimes they take some great features and they they bake it into their own operating systems and there's the cameo from ted lasso fantastic the second cameo i think so it basically feels like safari is now chrome yes i mean i'm all right with that to be honest so apple's basically doing everything they're doing everything that google does they got google lens they have chrome now uh what else do we have um oh we have the ability to use speakers i believe as um oh i think that works with android tv i gotta double check that don't quote me on that also somebody's very angry outside my apartment by the way so if you're hearing like honking from a truck it's coming from me well my mic well the last live event we did i as i had someone actively drilling into the road directly under my window so um i'm just so glad it's mildly quieter today the joy of it we're getting um a big talk on the head of worldwide developer resources i think that's what www stands for to talk about um the the nuts and bolts of the uh the d in dc developers so apis for share play okay so kind of talking up some of the stuff we've experienced today yeah sorry go legs so just quickly while we're talking about developer stuff that probably is to us uh we'll keep an eye on it but going back to what is talking about in terms of things that google already has we've seen the notation interface that is very or bringing up google notes google notes the notes app in um ipad os with the apple pencil being able to uh notate in with your voice or a scribble um in on oh and what was that that was watch os i think as well yeah just interesting to see kind of the yeah it's interesting to see the uh the interplay the sharing that's going on but the biggest one is yes uh safari is now chrome and google uh lens is now in ios but not cool that was camera apple yeah ios camera exactly object and object camera capture yeah nice that's interesting yeah uh yeah object capture so this allows you kind of capturing a bunch of images sort of three-dimensionally around an object and kind of creating a yeah a sort of digital version of the object yeah virtual model yeah that's really neat this is also like this is obviously going to tie into apple's ar plans over time if it's this simple to create objects that can be seen in ar like i believe you can do this with amazon already where you can place an object in your living room how it's supposed to look that's intriguing because you can if you're a smaller company let's say you're not amazon or you're just you're an etsy uh person you're like okay i've made this i shot this awesome uh sneaker i've made myself i've customized these sneakers i can shoot it in 3d and you can see what they look like or i could do portraits or any other thing the porsche is not a good example any other 3d object like like a sculpture so like that's kind of a neat idea that this this opens it up to a lot more people if you're a small business you could probably really enjoy using these tools assuming that there's a bunch of camera apps that can help you put this together and there you go the example of a sneaker just taking a bunch of photos of the sneaker you can have a 3d model without having to know how to do 3d modeling that is that kind of democratizes 3d modeling yeah you're right i think etsy is a great example there is you know people uh being able to go up against the because ikea is an example of you know that had the ar shopping experience so you can see what an object looks like in your space i think they mentioned wayfair the furniture brand there or the kind of homewares uh retailers so yeah being able to kind of see something in your space now becomes a lot simpler if you're not one of those companies that has an entire division working on that for you so i think that'd be cool if you could start to be like a small business and and roll that out that'd be awesome i have to say this is something like someone who's currently redecorating my space uh i wish that i could uh have this available to me to be able to place objects from retailers i'm thinking of buying and seeing it in three-dimensional space through augmented reality i i want this feature kind of yesterday so i don't end up having to buy and then return a lot of things just because they don't appear like to scale or in the right ways i'm thinking in in the house so i think this is a really interesting feature and yeah as you say smaller retailers i think really could potentially benefit from this because you won't have to have the ability to do studio photos of all of your goods and services well not services but goods that you're trying to sell so this will be this will be a big spoon i think for you speaking my language i'm trying to find a i'm trying to find a rug that matches my like hideously over-the-top palm print rattan furniture that i got and uh i just want someone to give me a way to like take internet rug and put on floor and see what it looks like because i just wander around with a tiny picture on my phone like holding it up next to the couch being like is this even gonna work so that is a that's the ar that i want in my life as i say i don't need an octopus on the floor no one needs an octopus on the floor but i really would like a rug on my floor that i can see what it looks like bring me that developers 50 for the first person who can do it i think it is i've seen an ad recently there's obviously i've got octopuses on the brain so uh something's going on there but i don't need an octopus on my floor that's the main message on a wwdc this year i have used that amazon ar feature i was buying an ottoman and i didn't pay attention to the dimensions but once i did an ar i realized it was way more massive than i thought i'm like oh i missed something in the description that's a huge difference so that's actually helps will help me not buy this massive thing so ar is already used in amazon so you should try that out for your rug maybe the rug will have a picture of an octopus on it everything about that maybe that's what you need it's fighting a palm tree it's like it's like a whole scene there's a palm tree and there's a fight i think we can get somewhere there you can tell that they're talking about super super developer stuff and we're talking about octopi on rugs i think that's the problem i is there a is there a feature for both of you guys that is kind of really exciting for you or has there been something like what's your fun little surprise easter egg or favorite feature from today because i i reckon it's the portrait photos that have the clock in the middle how am i so simple that that is my favorite feature uh i'll think of something better but you guys go lexi what's your favorite uh okay not not that um but i think just saying that also does indicate that there are it's not that much exciting stuff to talk about there's a lot of incremental updates that i feel like have been a long time coming but to me the most exciting part of the announcement and i think the one that is going to have the biggest ramifications for users all across the world specifically not just those tied into apple is the ability to have those face time discussions and conversations with people cross-platform so android and on web if you're say running windows to be able to bring in different people to that conversation i think companies like zoom uh like microsoft teams and google meet are probably going to be a little bit scared even though maybe facetime might be can i guess the context is a little bit more personal you'd probably use it more with friends rather than through work i think there could be a gradual shift there especially if a lot of people um are already using it you know as part of their day-to-day personal conversations maybe it makes more sense to migrate some of some especially smaller companies over to doing that on facetime there's just a lot more tools there so i think for me it paints an interesting picture about where potentially apple might be spreading its wings a little bit in terms of playing nice playing ball with other platforms and other ecosystems just a little bit it's the first time in a long time that we've seen that so that's exciting to me is how about you yeah for me i think it's really more about share play and just the idea of the continuity stuff that's going on with this having all of your stuff available on whatever device you have as long as it's from apple at this point that to me actually makes it a lot more livable right if i want to i want to arrange a time to watch a movie with somebody we could do that it's really simple as opposed to like again what service do you have do you know how to do this blah blah blah blah if i want to just move stuff to my laptop or to an ipad or an iphone it's supposed to be really easy so this idea of being able to share data and move it around in your home or online that to me is the most interesting thing because that's going to affect i think a lot of people minute to minute i think that's a really big deal it's on the watch face yeah i have to say i haven't seen any uh so you can continue the watch face things yeah i was just gonna say like that's a cool feature that excites me i think for me the um one of the cool features that i probably got most excited about was uh the privacy controls because i'm a nerd um but yeah the nifty ability to just kind of see the the i guess a control panel for privacy having that on your phone really accessible some of those notifi notification features were really good as well and um yeah i'm interested in the idea of the driver's license on your phone and apple working with tsa to make that usable in airports i mean obviously that's in the us only right obviously a huge market but as someone who comes from australia would be like that would be really cool but it's never going to make it over here so yeah it's a us it seems u.s specific right now but um that's a really interesting one i think that's got uh it's like a feature that's rolling out that has really interesting broad implications you know uh how we start to bring identity documents onto our devices i think it's super interesting and we also haven't seen any hardware yet so coming towards the end of the announcement i'm wondering either is this one more thing or there are no macbook pros probably the latter maybe we're on the 50 percent as i as we're saying it's 50 50 that we're gonna see uh hardware we're on the back end of that 50 now don't know lexi you were talking about facetime across platforms and i just wanted to clarify is imessage are the features of imessage rolling out cross-platform was was there any news on that uh lexi or eyes did you catch anything on that because i know it was a a question that came up in the comments and i really focused on the time um being the exciting thing but did either of you catch that as far as i know there was no mention of cross-platform availability of imessage now if they snuck it in on a card when they do show those things i haven't noticed that either so i'll be double checking that as well because i've seen those comments or questions in the youtube chat as far as i know they have not mentioned anything about that facetime they were very proud to show that it worked on browsers i think if they brought imessage and they were going to do that it would be a like landmark announcement yeah yeah i think yes i haven't seen anything about that um and it really does look like facetime is going to be kind of that first trial run i imessage is such an interesting interesting one because this is a huge quote it's the same thing will apple watch ever work with the with an android i don't think the answer is going to be yes uh i think there's been plenty of opportunities for apple to do that in previous times and with watch os 8 we maybe we've got a little sneak peek of potentially how it could be removed a little bit from the iphone but we still don't have that complete segmentation yet and i do not think it would be in apple's best interest to do that same with imessage even though there has been obviously that discussion with that in regards to apple versus epic as well so it looks like for now facetime is is the key they'll probably see how this goes how many people on android or windows are going to be joining facetime calls i'm sure that they can look at that that data obviously anonymized um and see if there is an audience for it that's over and there's no hardware it's over no harder yeah no no hardware we we got updates to pretty much all of the major products uh operating os and one hardware update no home os that's right uh okay so that's it for wwdc worldwide developer conference is over let's recap some of the i guess the headline um the headline updates that we got today so we were just talking about how apple was bringing facetime to people who are not necessarily on the iphone so you'll be able to have conversations with people who are also on android and potentially windows there's improvements to sharing features within ios 15 and notification tweaks in ios as well to use on-device learning to work out which notifications it potentially should surface above others and a new focus mode as well and apple's interpretation or version of google lens will also make an appearance on ios 15 within the apple camera so basically using the camera to do object recognition and also text recognition say for example you have a phone number captured on the image somewhere either in the camera at the time that you're looking through it or post capture you'll be able to do things with that information like say for example call that number uh okay is why don't you run us through some of the mac updates that we saw today um at wwdc or dub dub it's hard to say wwdc ww anything is hard to say i don't know trust me i have to say wwe network every now and then it's a nightmare uh let's see mac os was getting a lot of stuff that we've seen on other devices so one of the linchpins in their discussion and actually had a breakout was safari which was strange why safari was such a big deal for mac os but they discussed how safari is going to be redesigned and it's going to basically kind of get out of your way so if you're on a web page the color of the of the what's called chrome the stuff around it that changes its color as well to kind of match they've added tab groups they discussed having uh all of your your web browsing essentially going from one device to your other device to other devices ipad iphone and uh your mac they'll all have the same thing you had share play coming to mac os and share play is this new feature where you can decide to have a watch party with friends if you want to watch music or not watch music if you want listen to music or if you want to watch movies together you could do that and your mac would be one of the options to do that which is kind of neat to keep everything in sync uh we've had let's see what else we have shareplay universal control that thing was kind of a neat one this allows you to use the same mouse and keyboard on multiple devices so if you have a mac next to an ipad you want to just drag your mouse over the ipad's gonna recognize that you're trying to reach it which is kind of a strange but cool idea i believe we saw the ability to move files that way as well which is really kind of neat instead of having to airdrop you can just literally drag and drop with a mouse that's kind of neat so those are the i think the major things about mac os oh i forgot about the name that's the big one it's called monterey uh which is just fine it's fun to say and it's not like they went completely nuts like big sur i think a lot of people didn't know what that was at first i didn't i wouldn't know what big sur was if it wasn't for my wife because she's from california i'm like so we know it's monterrey monterey's got a lot of coverage when it came to finding dory the monterey bay aquarium so that's uh that's my mac os update love it all right claire what else did we get that was uh exciting for you in particular i know you were into a lot of the privacy stuff the wallet stuff as well and the watch os update why don't you give us a bit of a recap of everything else that excited you huge yeah uh well let's talk about the watch to start off with we saw some new mental health features tracking there uh to really make that device i guess more of a wellness device uh watch faces i mean that's a game changer right there and bringing more of that functionality down onto the watch itself so less of an echo uh the pepper's ghost of the phone that was i think at my peak delirium when i pulled that phrase out but yeah less of a kind of a shadow of the phone itself and making it more of its standalone device i'm inclined to agree with you lexi i think um making the watch uh work with any old phone is probably not something that's going to happen because for me as an android user i look at that watch and i go huh maybe that's a reason to get an iphone so i can get both so i think apple knows that that's how people purchase um a bunch of stuff we saw in the notifications as we've mentioned uh kind of a simplified process there and bringing in more features to uh the wallets so the ability to have your work swipe pass your driver's license have rfid or i think you were saying it was ultra wideband but basically other cards that you might tap to get in somewhere i think we saw a disneyland pass all of those coming into the wallet space we saw maps that was something that we were talking about something else and maps happened and then we're on to the next theme because this was a really fast and jam-packed press conference today but ar experience is in maps which is very cool so some updates coming there updated weather app we also saw i'm trying to rack my brains to like the beginning two hours ago um it feels like it was a million years ago um oh we saw some obviously some big privacy features in terms of tracking uh the features coming to icloud plus so that's uh some some new features around being able to set up a kind of a one-time use email address um and having a backup friend or family member to be able to help you access your account if you're locked out or to have legacy contacts if you die being able to have that account kind of passed over to a legacy contact uh they're going to be allowing building apps on ipads um multitasking excuse me multitasking on the ipad which you mentioned i as being able to kind of move across devices uh ipad widgets was another thing um brian doing a stellar effort there trying to keep up with the images on screen of all the stuff i'm rambling through um find my coming to airpods not a help if they drop down a drain and you can see them but can't reach them uh still still very cool um i think the wallet is a cool feature for me and yeah the facetime video calls being able to go cross-platform is something exciting because i can see that uh immediately being a benefit to me for when i call my parents they'll be able to facetime me now and not just call every form of chat facetime um but good on apple for being able to brand you know zoom chat as face time it's uh it's a good brand awareness right there so yeah it was a packed day i really feel like just need to like take a moment have a glass of water not choke on it um but yeah there was there was a lot happening yes a lot to wrap your head around um everything that we have talked about today and everything that has been announced is on cnet.com so you can go there for the full analysis of all the announcements from wwdc i think for me one of the most interesting pieces of this puzzle is apple's pushed into more health-based data collection and also the ways it's going to share that information with not only you as the person who all that data has been collected about but also with your doctor so the ability to create reports and aggregated information about things like your lab results for example or your walking gait or your steadiness so you'll be able to have the phone detect potentially are you going to fall in the near future based on the metrics that the phone is measuring about your gate and your stride and things like that so i think that is very interesting there's a lot of real potential there in terms of the health and safety aspects of that and also in terms of the apple watch itself how that all ties into the health app making sure that you can keep tabs on say elderly family members or even kids keeping an eye on things like heart rate maybe you don't live with your direct family members but you still want to be able to you know make sure that they're doing okay um and keep an eye on things like that i think that will be some interesting you know privacy issues and concerns there as well immediately come to mind but i think that there is a lot of good potential to be dived into there as well overall though i think there was a lot of incremental updates and things like you know the weather app notes maps all those things that we've talked about haven't been too much of a surprise because it's stuff we should have got couple years ago so overall i think that there were important changes that needed to be made a couple of surprises in there too um but i think a lot of this was catch up and a lot of this was very much based around everyday users rather than developers there were only a couple things towards the end and also discussions of apis and so on so this actually felt like the least developery wwdc that i've ever been through i don't know about you two is but has this been a developery conference to you it felt very consumer almost yeah i didn't agree with you there was a lot of consumer facing features that they were showing off but i think uh while we're going ooh and like personally i was saying that by shareplay i think that's really cool that's going to be really important for people who are creating apps that they want to work with shareplay so if they have their own video services obviously google's going to work around with youtube i'd imagine but like smaller venues smaller channels might have their own ways to do this so while these are really cool there's also like the when you talk about the health stuff finding out about this the the gate of a person i don't know how much data will be accessible by developers generally on that that's kind of a curiosity of mine considering this is very sensitive information so it definitely felt consumer-facing but i'm just wondering like if if i was a developer would i just be seeing okay that i can use i can bring this into my app i have a music app i want it to work with shareplay i want my video app to work with shareplay i want to use some of this this health information to some impact maybe even your playlists on your music you can have that too like if you're if your heart rate's supposed to be higher maybe you need higher energy music or something just kind of spitball there so i think that we saw a lot of cool things that consumers are going to like i'm just really curious where developers are going to take it especially with even something like that universal control like if you have the ability to move files back and forth as easily as you can between ipads and macs what's the next thing what's a developer going to figure out with that how how can you push that so definitely consumer facing but i'm sure developers have their they're really they've got their thinking caps on figuring out what can i do with this yeah i think yeah i've got to say there's a lot of questions that claire you can go i was just going to say uh it's interesting that this is a developer conference and we sort of saw a mix of consumer and incremental updates and then a little bit kind of geared towards devs at the end um i gotta say though a lot of people very very angry that we didn't see new macs today and i think that wasn't necessarily going to be a lock because um we obviously got the m1 max last year i think time is meaningless now um but yeah it's not necessarily always a hardware event we saw new features being able to use features on your mac and kind of come across to your ipad as we're seeing on screen now with that universal control but in terms of physical hardware i think the answer behind that is well not necessarily uh it's not necessarily a big hardware event uh the wwdc but also global chip shortage you know we just don't have processors to kind of put in devices companies all around the world car manufacturers apple themselves other tech manufacturers are really really struggling so i think maybe that was uh part of the the story here about why there were no um you know no new max that was a bit of a rumor a lot of people may be disappointed that that didn't happen but i think they're still um still trying to get the ducks in a row with the m1 roll out uh we didn't see an m2 or an m1x we thought maybe that might happen but it seemed a lot of getting more out of the hardware getting more out of the processors rather than giving us new chips new devices things like that so uh yeah that's a that's a question that's popped up a bunch in the comments um and yeah i would have liked a new mac today that was uh you know had all those ports available remember we were talking about that at the start gosh that would have been so good but yes alas not to be more about um more about software and more about functionality today so i think there was some cool features um nothing blowing me out of the water but i think there's a lot of things that are going to make life a lot easier for apple users and incidentally not apple users with that facetime feature so like see i think it's a bit of a mixed bag but yeah interesting very much mixed bag and the big news as well um after the keynote of course is the developer betas so ios 15 ipad os um 15 watch os and mac os monterey the developer betas are all going to be made available today for people with developer accounts members of the public who want to be a part of the public beta those are going to be coming out sometime in july we don't know exact dates yet uh is let us know uh we were talking a little bit during the show about ios 15 and the compatibility list is the iphone uh 6s on the list i think you've shared the list with us yes would you believe it so it goes so in the the you got the iphone 6s the 6s plus the iphone se first generation iphone sc second generation ipod touch 7th generation i mentioned in the oldest stuff because this is usually where the cutoffs happen obviously iphone 8 everything above it iphone 7 as well and up will obviously get ios 15. but the fact that it's coming to sc first gen sc second gen the 6s and 6s plus these are extremely old devices and apple is still supporting them which likely means this is the last year so if you're one of those people who decides to sell their devices before they get cut off this is probably your last year of updates because this is the 6s and 6s plus were supported with the last year's big big change with the widgets and everything so i would imagine that this is going to run out next year so enjoy it while you can everything's coming in the fall by the way the official one so if you don't want to do any of the betas mac os and ios is and i believe ipad os all that stuff all the changes coming out in the fall that's right um so stay tuned to cnet.com with all the latest details we will be doing rap videos of all of the information that you've heard about today wwdc hiya sinclair thank you so much for hanging out with me for the past two and a half hours it's felt like a lifetime but it has been a pleasure with you too so thanks for coming on this crazy ride with me thanks lexi for hosting us thank you very much thanks so much behind the scenes to brian steven bonnie viva amy and everyone on the cnet video team

and welcome back to Apple Park for our first event of 2021. After the challenges
of this past year, we're optimistic that brighter
days are just in front of us. As we move forward,
we feel it's important that Apple continues
to make a difference in people's lives, through our products
and our values. So we're glad
you could join us today for some exciting updates
and announcements. This week marks the annual
Earth Day celebration and I couldn't be more proud
of the environmental initiatives and commitments
we are making at Apple. Today, Apple is carbon neutral for our global
corporate operations, with all of our offices, stores,
and data centers running on
100 percent renewable energy. And by 2030, Apple will be
100 percent carbon neutral across our entire
end-to-end footprint, including our supply chain
and the use of our products. This month,
we launched the Restore Fund in partnership
with Conservation International, and Goldman Sachs. This pioneering new investment
fund will provide returns that are measured
not only financially, but by the tons
of atmospheric carbon removed by each investment. Our goal is to remove more than one million tons
of carbon every year. At Apple, our values and
principles make us who we are. They drive us to create products
and services that are better, easier, and more enjoyable. Now I'd like to turn
to some updates on our services, beginning with Apple Card. With Apple Card we set out to completely reinvent
the credit card and enable people to live
a healthier financial life. Our customers are loving
all the benefits of Apple Card and we believe
it's the most successful credit card launch ever. One of the things that became
apparent to us in the beginning was a lack of fairness in the way the industry
calculated credit scores. When there were two holders
of a credit card, one got the benefit of
building a good credit history and the other did not. We want to reinvent
the way this works too. So today,
we're happy to announce that Apple Card will allow
spouses and partners to share and merge their credit lines, have equal rights
on their account, and build credit equally. This solution helps
deliver financial equity, and it's a game changer. And Apple Card can now
be used by anyone in your family over the age of thirteen, with optional spending limits
and controls for kids. We call this set of features
Apple Card Family. These benefits reflect
our ongoing mission to reinvent the credit card and help you
and those closest to you experience a healthier
financial life. Now let's talk about
Apple Podcasts. As you know, Apple helped
launch the podcast industry 15 years ago. And this is what it looked like. The day we launched
Podcasts in iTunes, we had 3,000 shows
in the directory. Today, there are millions
to choose from, and Apple Podcasts
is the best place to listen to all your favorites. And we're making
the biggest change to Apple Podcasts
since its debut. This starts with
a newly designed Apple Podcasts app. Every show and episode
has a beautiful new page making it easy to follow,
listen, and share. We're also introducing Channels
to help you find new shows from your favorite creators. And you'll get recommendations
for new channels to explore. We're also introducing
Apple Podcasts Subscriptions, which enables you
to unlock new content as well as additional benefits,
like ad-free listening, early access, and much more. So now you can help
your favorite podcasters build their business
and fuel their creativity. Apple Podcasts Subscriptions
launches in 170 regions and countries next month. These major updates will make
listening to podcasts easier and more enjoyable
than ever before. Now let's turn to iPhone. iPhone 12 is the most popular
smartphone in the world, and people love
its amazing features: Super Retina XDR displays
with Ceramic Shield, incredible camera systems,
and 5G. And, of course,
they love the stunning design and selection
of beautiful colors. And we have
another beautiful color, perfect for spring. ♪ "The Candy Man"

like iPhone 12, uses helpful overlays
to guide you directly to a lost item when it's nearby. We call this Precision Finding. As you move, Precision Finding uses
our U1 chip to get the precise distance
to your AirTag. iPhone fuses that data
with input from the camera, accelerometer, and gyroscope to give you visual, haptic,
and audible feedback, guiding you
right to your AirTag. [LOW TONE] [BRIGHT CHIME] At Apple, we believe
privacy is a human right, and that's why we designed it
into AirTag and the Find My network. With the Find My network
everyone can participate without sharing their location
to anyone, including Apple. AirTag is designed to
track items, not people. So we included safety features
to discourage unwanted tracking, like unwanted tag detection,
rotating identifiers, and audible alerts
from unknown tags. These capabilities are
an industry first and are driven by
our commitment to privacy. So that's AirTag. AirTag is just $29, and because you likely have
more than one important item in your life,
a 4-pack is just $99. Orders start this Friday, and AirTag will be available
April 30th. We also worked with Hermès on a special handcrafted
leather collection, a bag charm,
luggage tag, and key ring, each including an AirTag etched
with an Hermès signature. With AirTag
and the Find My network, iPhone can now help you
find even more things. And now, back to Tim. [UPBEAT MUSIC] ♪ [BUZZING] ♪ Tim: Now let's talk

the best way to enjoy it, and everything on Apple TV+, is with Apple TV 4K. To tell you more about
what's new with Apple TV 4K, here's Cindy. ♪ "Carrera"
by Brokenstra & YADAM ♪ ♪ Cindy Lin: What makes Apple TV
truly unique is its deep integration
of Apple hardware, software, and services. Apple TV is built on the same
world-class Apple silicon we put into iPhone. And it runs tvOS, the most powerful
TV operating system. Giving Apple TV all this power, power that smart TVs
just don't have, lets you magically transform
your living room, so you can get in
your morning workout with Apple Fitness+, show off your school project
using AirPlay, battle it out on Apple Arcade, and even sneak in
a late night movie with AirPods. The ability to do all
of these things and so much more is why we've put so much power
into Apple TV. And it's why I'm so excited
to share with you the next generation
of Apple TV 4K. Apple TV 4K is now built
with the A12 Bionic, bringing a new level
of performance that will be a massive upgrade
to your TV. Delivering the highest
visual quality possible has always been core
to Apple TV. It already supports
High Dynamic Range formats, such as Dolby Vision, revealing more realistic colors
and greater detail. And with the A12 Bionic, the new Apple TV 4K can now play
HDR in high frame rate. This allows video
to play more smoothly and appear more lifelike
than ever before, which will be great for
fast-moving action, like sports. We're working with leading
providers across the globe as they begin to stream
in high frame rate HDR. And it's not just
professionally-produced programs that will look amazing. For those of you
with an iPhone 12 Pro, you can already record
in Dolby Vision at 60 frames per second. And to enjoy all these moments
in the best quality on the new Apple TV 4K, we've enhanced AirPlay
to support high frame rate HDR. We want everything you watch
on Apple TV to look amazing, but because every TV's settings
are different, it's challenging to know if
you're getting the best picture, until now. With our new
Color Balance feature, Apple TV will
work with your iPhone and its advanced sensors to improve your TV's
picture quality. Your iPhone uses its camera
and proximity sensor to guide you
to an onscreen target. Color measurements
start automatically. Apple TV uses the light sensor
in your iPhone to compare your TV's
color balance to the industry-standard
specifications used by cinematographers
worldwide. Using this data, Apple TV will then
automatically tailor its video output to compensate
for any inaccuracies in your TV's picture settings. So you'll now see
much more accurate color without you ever having
to adjust your TV. The results can be dramatic, with more natural colors
and improved contrast making your TV look
better than ever. Of course, the way you interact
with Apple TV is with the Siri Remote. So this year,
we completely redesigned it with new functionality
and controls. It starts with a new
one-piece aluminum design that fits perfectly
in your hand, and with contrasting controls you can easily find and hit
just the button you want. We also have
a brand new clickpad, with five-way navigation
for better accuracy, and the entire clickpad
is touch enabled, preserving the fast
directional swipes users love. And we did something
pretty cool with the outer ring. We've given it
a new circular gesture that turns it
into a jog control. Perfect for finding just
the scene you're looking for. We've also made it
the only remote you need for your TV. It now has a Power button that controls your TV's power, and another for Mute. And we've moved
the Siri button to the side, just like on your iPhone. The enclosure is made from
100 percent recycled aluminum joining Apple TV 4K
and all of our products in furthering our commitment to reducing
our environmental impact. So that's the new Apple TV 4K. It'll be available
for $179 with 32GB, or $199 with double
the storage capacity, perfect for enjoying
even more apps and games. You can order on April 30th, and they'll be available
in the second half of May. With the power of A12 Bionic, the realism
of High Frame Rate HDR, and a totally redesigned
Siri Remote, the new Apple TV 4K

completely redesigned iMac is more personal, more powerful, and more capable than ever. And it's incredible
from every angle. It's bursting with color from both the front
and the back, and it practically disappears
when you view it from the side. Let's take a look
at its revolutionary design. iMac's new form is stunning, with a spectrum
of vibrant colors, so you can choose the one that
fits your own, personal style. We wanted it to feel light
and optimistic, while instantly brightening up
any space. From the front,
iMac is clean and simple with a single sheet of glass
covering the entire surface. The softer colors
and light gray borders ground the iMac
in your environment and allow you to focus
on your content. In contrast
to the more neutral front, the back is designed
to really celebrate color, with bold,
richly saturated shades. In many places,
the back of iMac is the first thing you'll see, so we created colors
that would bring a sense of joy to any space. Next, let's check out
the striking side profile, where you really see
the profound impact of M1. With every generation,
iMac has moved closer to our vision:
to make the computer disappear. And while we've had the same
great design for several years, we haven't had the technology
to take the next big step. Until now, because M1 has enabled us to get closer to that vision
than ever before. For comparison,
let's take a look at the previous iMac. The logic board and thermals
were huge because of
the power-hungry processor. And the CPU, GPU,
and other components were all separate chips
in the system. Now, with the system-on-a-chip
architecture of M1, these are all consolidated into
this much smaller logic board. And because M1 is
far more power efficient, the bulky thermal system is
replaced by just two small fans. This keeps the system cool, while running
exceptionally quiet. In fact, for typical use,
iMac stays under 10 decibels, which is barely audible
to the human ear. Together,
these new components help reduce iMac's overall
volume by over 50 percent. The result is a design
that's much more compact and just 11.5 millimeters thin. And with
an even smaller footprint, it fits easily
into many more spaces. Next, iMac has always been
about its best-in-class display. So on the new iMac we made the display
an expansive 24 inches. By narrowing the borders, we fit
the significantly bigger display in a design
that's only slightly larger than the 21.5-inch iMac. And it has nearly
11.3 million pixels in its 4.5K Retina display. So you can see your content
in all its glorious detail. And with a P3 wide gamut
and over a billion colors, plus 500 nits of brightness, every image is brilliant
and vivid. It also has True Tone, which automatically adjusts
the color temperature as your environment changes, for a more natural
viewing experience. And it has a coating
with industry-leading low reflectivity
for greater comfort and readability. iMac's new design, with its immersive display,
is awesome. And we're just getting started. We also pushed
every other aspect of the experience forward. First, we've taken iMac's
camera, mics, and speakers to a whole new level. And to tell you more,
here's Navpreet. [UPBEAT MUSIC] Navpreet Kaloty:
We've all been spending more and more time
on video calls. So with the new iMac it was important to us to enhance the core technologies that keep us connected. Let's start with the camera. iMac now has a 1080p
FaceTime HD Camera which doubles the resolution,
for much higher quality video. And with and larger sensor, the camera performs great
in low light. The camera is paired with M1, which has Apple's latest
image signal processor, or ISP. This works to further enhance
the image quality with computational video. Let's take a look
at the processing pipeline. As you use the camera,
the ISP goes through a series of steps to analyze
and enhance each pixel, at over a trillion operations
per second. For example,
it works with M1's Neural Engine to make
more intelligent exposure and white balance adjustments, so your lighting
is always just right. It utilizes advanced
noise reduction algorithms to bring a new level of clarity
to your video. And it uses tone mapping to deliver
enhanced dynamic range, bringing more detail
to bright highlights and dark shadows. This camera will make you look
like a rock star. In fact, it's the best camera
we've ever put in a Mac. And to complement the camera, we gave iMac a studio-quality,
three-mic array. The mics are engineered
to reduce feedback from the rest of the system, so conversations flow
more naturally, and you'll interrupt
each other less. And beamforming
allows these mics to better ignore
background noise and focus on your voice, which means you'll come through
loud and clear on video calls, or when recording
an audio track. This is also the best mic system
ever in a Mac. Now, with this amazing camera
and mic array, you know we leveled up
the speakers too. To create big,
room-filling sound, speakers need to displace
a lot of air. In order to do this,
we increased the power driving the iMac's sound system. Now, while iMac needed
to have big sound, it also had to deliver
accurate sound. So we gave it two pairs
of force-cancelling woofers that produce
an incredible bass response while reducing
unintended vibrations from that increased power. And we balanced each set
with a high-performance tweeter. The result
is a six-speaker system that produces
a massive soundstage with strong, articulate bass and crystal-clear mids
and highs. All of these
speaker innovations, coupled with
advanced algorithms, enable iMac to support
spatial audio when playing video
with Dolby Atmos. On the beautiful
4.5K Retina display, it's an outstanding
movie-watching experience. With its dramatic improvements
in balance, vocal clarity, and instrument separation, iMac delivers
a remarkably robust and high-quality
audio experience. Simply put,
it's the best sound system ever in a Mac, and we can't wait
for you to hear it. Back to you, Colleen. Colleen: With these camera
and audio features, and its stunning display, iMac delivers an entirely
new level of capability. Now add in the power
and performance of M1 and macOS Big Sur, this experience
is simply unrivaled. You can feel the difference
immediately, as iMac wakes almost instantly, and your apps launch
with blazing speed. Everything you do
on macOS Big Sur is extremely responsive, and the apps you use every day
are fast and fluid. Like in Safari,
you can browse even faster and run hundreds
of tabs at once. In Photos,
you can fly through edits to your iPhone images. And in Apple Arcade, gaming on iMac
is better than ever, with awesome
and exclusive games, like Warp Drive. M1 delivers
so much great performance, you can even keep playing while simultaneously taking
your next Zoom call. And with powerful creative apps
optimized for M1, it's easier than ever
to explore your passion, or find a new one. When it comes
to CPU performance in apps like Xcode, Lightroom,
and iMovie, iMac is up to 85 percent faster than the previous
21.5-inch iMac models. So you can compile
new apps in Xcode in a fraction of the time, easily work with massive
100-megapixel photos in Lightroom,
and export your favorite video projects
in iMovie faster than ever. And when it comes to
GPU performance, for certain apps like
Affinity Photo and Photoshop, iMac is up to two times faster
than the previous models. And it's even
up to 50 percent faster than the most powerful
discrete graphics in the fastest 21.5-inch iMac. So you can render edits to your next brilliant
composition in real-time with Affinity Photo, or quickly transform a picture
into an oil painting with Photoshop. And in Final Cut Pro, you can edit up to five streams
of 4K footage, or one stream of 8K footage, without dropping a frame. And machine learning
is now up to three times faster, in apps that leverage
M1's 16-core Neural Engine. So apps like Vectornator, which can swiftly turn a photo
into vector layers, get even faster on iMac. And because iMac has
the same chip architecture as iPhone and iPad, you can run iPhone and iPad apps like Headspace and Zillow, right on your iMac,
without breaking your workflow. Or you can enjoy games, like Sky: Children of the Light, while you spread out on iMac and use your keyboard
as a game controller. And with iCloud and Continuity, it's easier than ever
to use iMac and iPhone together. Your calls and texts
come right to iMac so no need to switch devices
when you're in the zone. And that email
you started on iPhone? You can use Hand Off
to finish it on iMac. And you can even copy text
and images on iPhone and then paste them
right into a document on iMac, with the magic
of Universal Clipboard. And all your content
is always available and up to date
across all your Apple devices. You're going to love
the combination of M1 and macOS
on the new iMac. It's the ultimate
Big Sur experience. And we're not done yet. iMac has state-of-the-art
connectivity for all your data and devices. It has up to four USB-C ports including two Thunderbolt ports for super fast data transfer, and support
for up to a 6K display, like the Pro Display XDR. And we created
a new power connector that attaches magnetically so it's quick and easy
to connect. It has a 2-meter,
color-matched woven cable that leads to
a small power adapter, which can be placed on the floor
behind your desk. And for Ethernet,
check out this cool innovation. It connects to the adapter and runs through
the power cable, to keep your desktop
less cluttered. Now let's take a closer look
at iMac's new keyboard, mouse, and trackpad options. You can choose
from three types of keyboards with gorgeous
aluminum enclosures color-matched to iMac. First, there's a Magic Keyboard
with new Emoji, Spotlight, Dictation, and Do Not Disturb keys, and a Lock key,
to instantly lock iMac. Next, there's a Magic Keyboard
with an exciting new feature: Touch ID,
which comes to the Mac desktop for the first time. Wireless fingerprint
data transmission is made possible
by a secure processor in the keyboard. It communicates directly
with the Secure Enclave in M1, creating an encrypted channel
to protect your fingerprint data from end to end. So whether you're making
a purchase with Apple Pay or unlocking your iMac,
it's fast, easy, and secure. And Touch ID also works
with Fast User Switching so you can change
to a different user profile with just the touch of a finger. And there's a Magic Keyboard
with Touch ID and a numeric keypad, too. Magic Mouse,
loved by iMac users, now features
color-matched aluminum. And Magic Trackpad, still by far
the industry's best, has a refined shape
to match the new keyboard. These new accessories
complete the system and bring even more capability
to iMac. With a colorful,
cutting-edge design, best-in-class features, the power of M1,
and macOS Big Sur, the new iMac can do it all, dynamically transforming
any space into whatever you need it to be. Let's take a look
at the many ways iMac can fit into your life. Say "Hello" to the new iMac. You've never seen a computer
like this before. Yeah, it's really that thin. But it's not magic. It's the M1 chip,
which is kind of magic. And it makes the new iMac fast. Like your apps open
instantly fast. Like check that text
while you clean your inbox while you share that photo
while you stream that show fast. That's fast. It has a 4.5K Retina display for colors that pop
off the screen. A 1080p camera, so you'll look right
in any light. And whether you're talking
to one person, or 100, the mics always focus
on your voice. So they hear you,
not what's around you. ♪ Six speakers and Dolby Atmos means everything you do
sounds great. Matching keyboard and mouse, and wireless Touch ID. Boom, boom, boom. [IPHONE CHIMES] And what happens on your iPhone also happens on your iMac. That's definitely magic. This is the new iMac. Oh, wait, I forgot! It comes in seven colors. Colleen: With iMac,
the possibilities are endless. And like all of our products, iMac has been built to minimize
its impact on the environment. 100 percent of the virgin
wood fiber in iMac's packaging comes from
responsibly managed forests. And iMac has 100 percent
recycled rare earth magnets in the speakers, fan motor,
and power connector. And of course, iMac meets
Apple's high standards for environmental
responsibility in materials, renewable energy,
and energy efficiency. So that's the new iMac. With its extraordinary design, powerful performance,
and incredible features, it starts at just $1299
in four colors. And at $1499,
iMac comes in seven colors with these additional features. You can order the new iMac
starting April 30th. And it will be available
in the second half of May. The new iMac
is the first Mac completely redesigned around
the revolutionary M1 chip. With a 24-inch,
4.5K Retina display, the best camera, mics,
and speakers ever in a Mac, macOS Big Sur, and Touch ID, iMac is the most personal,
powerful, capable, and simply the most fun
it's ever been. We can't wait to see
what you do on iMac. And now back to John. John:
The new iMac joins MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac mini in our incredible family
of M1 Macs. And with the new iMac, the strongest lineup of Macs
we've ever had gets even better. The new iMac
is another huge step forward in our transition
to Apple Silicon, and it brings
the amazing M1 experience to even more Mac users. But it's not just Mac users who
want to get their hands on it. [EXCITING MUSIC] ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Raja Bose: That's right, the M1 chip
is not just in the Mac, it's now in iPad Pro. And it's gonna blow you away. iPad Pro has always used
turbo-charged versions of our A-series chips
to deliver a powerful and responsive experience that's years ahead
of anything else. M1 continues that momentum by taking it
to an entirely new level, with a big jump in performance
to run powerful apps and drive a high-performance
ecosystem. For M1 to fit into
its incredibly thin and light design
requires power efficiency that's way beyond
just being better. It has to be amazing, and M1 delivers. And because M1 shares the same fundamental
architecture of A-Series chips, iPadOS is already built
to take full advantage of its powerful technology. The next-level performance
that M1 unlocks on iPad Pro starts with its powerful CPU. Built around the world's fastest
CPU core in low power silicon, the 8-core design of M1 delivers
a whopping 50 percent jump over the industry-leading
performance of the previous iPad Pro. What's amazing is that compared
to the first generation iPad, this iPad Pro now delivers up to 75 times faster
CPU performance. It's no wonder apps
are pushing the limits of what's possible on iPad. From blazing performance
for vector and raster tools in Affinity Designer, to rendering the most detailed
designs with Shapr3D, to adding complex effects
to 4K videos in LumaFusion. iPad's expansive display
comes bursting to life with M1's amazing graphics
performance. The 8-core GPU
is in a class of its own delivering up to 40 percent
faster graphics performance. Again, compared to
the first generation iPad-- get ready for this-- the graphics
of this new iPad Pro is now over 1,500 times faster. That's just ridiculous. So painting with watercolors
and oils in Adobe Fresco look and feel
like the real thing. And you can bring
the most intricate AR models into the real world
with JigSpace. You can also play
the latest games with console-quality graphics
at super high frame rates. This raw performance, along with
the ProMotion display, four speakers, and now, support
for the latest PlayStation or Xbox game controllers,
with haptics, makes playing games
on iPad Pro insanely fun. With this combination of CPU
and graphics performance, the new iPad Pro is, yet again, the fastest device of its kind. It's not even close. But it's bigger than that, because powerful,
custom technologies like our latest 16-core
Apple Neural Engine, advanced Image Signal Processor, and unified, high bandwidth
memory architecture make iPad Pro
more capable than ever. And the industry leading
power efficiency of M1 enables all of that
amazing performance along with all-day battery life in the incredibly thin
and light design of iPad Pro. The new iPad Pro
also allows users to access their content
faster than ever with up to two times
faster storage. And,
for our most demanding users, a new 2TB configuration gives you enormous
storage capacity, so you can keep
up to 60,000 ProRAW photos at your fingertips, or up to 220 hours
of 4K HDR video content with you wherever you go. M1 brings
much faster connectivity to iPad Pro as well. The USB-C port already supports
super fast data transfers. And now we're adding Thunderbolt with USB 4 support as well. Making it the fastest,
most versatile port ever on an iPad, or any other device of its kind. Not only is there four times
more bandwidth for wired connections, up to 40 gigabits per second, Thunderbolt also opens up
a massive ecosystem of high performance accessories like super fast storage, external displays,
like the Pro Display XDR, now at its full 6K resolution, and all connected
using high-performance cables and docks. iPad Pro now fits perfectly
into so many more workflows. Now on a mobile device
like iPad Pro, ultrafast wireless connections
are absolutely critical. And that's why
we've added 5G to iPad Pro. Accessing files, collaborating with colleagues, and backing up data
are fundamental when you're on the go. [UPBEAT MUSIC] This is huge! Super fast 5G
cellular connections lets users be creative
and productive wherever they are. Download speeds can be as high
as 3.5 gigabits per second in ideal conditions. Of course, 5G speeds will vary
by carrier and region. In the US, iPad Pro also
supports millimeter wave, the high frequency version
of 5G. And with this model,
iPad Pro can reach up to 4 gigabits per second
peak download speeds in ideal conditions. So no matter where
your work takes you, you can live-stream
from wherever you are. This is Ashwaria,
reporting from San Francisco. First off, I want to
congratulate everybody... Raja: And you never
have to miss a meeting on your way to work. I was on mute. Sorry.
Uh, I wanna congratulate... Raja: The blazing speeds of 5G allow you
to do just about anything, just about anywhere. And there's more. iPad's versatility
is further enhanced by its Pro Cameras. And to tell you more,
here's Fiona. [DRAMATIC TONE] Fiona O'Leary: Customers love
taking stunning photos and videos on their iPad. And with powerful apps, these advanced cameras
enable so much more, like video capture
for mobile journalists and content creators, especially with the built-in
studio quality mics on iPad Pro. And with the LiDAR Scanner, they pave the way
to completely new workflows like motion-tracking
with CamTrackAR. Super accurate depth data makes going from green screen
to pre-visualization on location easier than ever. And you can build
that final render with greater confidence. Or how designers and architects
visualize their projects with Arki,
on-site, at full scale, complete with people occlusion, realistic shadows,
and real-time lighting. Or to simply bring
your imagination to life. Check out
this new version of Clips, which uses the LiDAR Scanner to transform your living room into a magical space
for your next video. How fun is that? And with the more powerful ISP
in M1, we get Smart HDR 3, where the ISP and
the Neural Engine work together to adjust color, contrast,
and noise in distinct parts of a photo. And in low light conditions, the ISP and LiDAR Scanner quickly and accurately
focus images and videos to capture incredible details
from almost no light at all. On the front,
the TrueDepth camera instantly and securely unlocks
iPad with Face ID, and takes portrait selfies, which look amazing
on that large display. And now, more than ever,
it plays an important role when collaborating
with co-workers, and connecting with
family and friends. So in the new iPad Pro, we're going to take
a huge step forward by updating the TrueDepth
camera system to include an all-new,
Ultra Wide camera, designed specifically for iPad. It features
a new 12-megapixel sensor with a 122 degree field of view, which enables
something really cool. And we call it Center Stage! Center Stage uses
the new Ultra Wide camera and machine learning
to recognize and keep you
in the center of the view. What's amazing is,
as you move around, it automatically pans
to keep you in the shot. And that's not all. When others join in,
it recognizes them too and zooms out
to fit everyone into the view. So whether
it's a white boarding session with co-workers
or a family get together, the experience of connecting
is now more engaging than ever. So that's the new Ultra Wide
camera with Center Stage. Video calls
never looked so good. Now, back to Raja. Raja:
iPad is a magical sheet of glass that can become anything
you want it to be. And the centerpiece of
that experience on iPad Pro, is its stunning
Liquid Retina display, which features a long list of
advanced display technologies, many that we've pioneered
on iPad. We introduced it as the world's
most advanced mobile display. The Liquid Retina display
delivers nearly 4 million pixels on the 11-inch iPad Pro. Users love being able to take the most powerful iPad
experience with them everywhere in a portable one-pound design. On the immersive
12.9-inch iPad Pro, it delivers an enormous
5.6 million pixels. This is for those
who want the biggest window for their creative workflows. And we have
some exciting news here. We know our users are
increasingly creating content with the high brightness
and high contrast ratio of HDR. So we first equipped
creative users with the Pro Display XDR
to view and edit their content. This amazing display delivers extremely high
brightness and an extremely high
contrast ratio. And now we're gonna take
the next big step. We're bringing the stunning
front-of-screen performance of our Pro Display XDR
to our 12.9-inch iPad Pro, so our users can take their
XDR workflow wherever they go. This is the new
Liquid Retina XDR display. And it delivers 1000 nits
of full-screen brightness, a breathtaking
1,600 nits of peak brightness, and a phenomenal
1,000,000:1 contrast ratio, just like Pro Display XDR. Now, due to the ultra-thin
design of iPad Pro, compared to the Pro Display XDR, we had to take an entirely new
approach to make this happen. So to tell you all about it,
here's Heidi. Heidi Delgado:
Extreme Dynamic Range is all about delivering
a visual experience that reflects what we see
in the real world. This means seeing
the brightest highlights, along with subtle details in
the darkest parts of an image. Bringing the XDR experience
to iPad Pro was an enormous challenge. We had to rethink
how the display creates light. So we went back
to the drawing board. To achieve
way higher brightness, we used an array of LEDs across the entire back
of the display, similar to the Pro Display XDR. And to fit within
the ultra-thin iPad Pro design, these LEDs need to be
incredibly small. So we developed a Mini-LED, which is over 120 times smaller
in volume than the previous design. And because these Mini-LEDs
are so small, achieving
extremely high brightness requires lots of them. And I mean thousands of them. In fact,
there are over 10,000 LEDs that deliver
XDR-level brightness on that stunning
12.9-inch display. That's a massive increase over the 72 LEDs that were in
the previous iPad Pro. We then grouped
these Mini-LEDs into over 2,500
local dimming zones. So depending on the content, we can precisely adjust
the brightness in each zone. The result is an extremely high one million to one
contrast ratio. The light is then shaped
by a series of incredibly thin, custom-designed,
optical films and diffusers. And that's why this display
can fit into a design that's just
6.4 millimeters thin, weighs just 1.5 pounds, and still delivers
all-day battery life. So HDR content with the finest
specular highlights, like galaxies and star fields, is more true-to-life than ever. We're thrilled to deliver
the XDR experience on the new iPad Pro. Back to Raja. Raja:
There's never been a display that delivers
this kind of visual experience on any other mobile device. So users can now do things
they could never do before. Videographers have
a large XDR display they can take with them
everywhere and edit true-to-life
HDR content using LumaFusion. Photographers
can see even more detail when editing their images
right on iPad using Lightroom. And filmmakers can more
confidently review and approve HDR content
with Frame.IO, previewing it
as it's meant to be seen from anywhere on the set. And everyone can enjoy
a mobile, cinematic viewing and listening experience, with support for
HDR video formats like HDR10, HLG, and Dolby Vision. And the advanced sound system
supports Dolby Atmos as well. So this is our new 12.9-inch
Liquid Retina XDR display. With this amazing set
of features, it goes beyond
any display in the world. And we couldn't wait
to put the new iPad Pro, with all of its advanced
new technologies, in the hands of our developers. Check out what happened
when we did. [UPBEAT MUSIC] ♪ All right. -I'm Nitasha.

by Ruelle playing] Hello and welcome back to Apple Park. I am so glad you could join us today. Just last month we were here
to introduce some great new products: Apple Watch Series 6, Apple Watch SE, as well as the eighth-generation iPad and the all-new iPad Air. And we've got some more
huge announcements for you today. So let's get started with
an exciting new product for the home we know you're going to love. This year, our homes have become
even more important in our daily lives. So it's critical that the technology
we choose for our home provides a truly great experience. When we approach
designing products for the home, we focus on three key attributes: First, they must be easy to use, from the initial setup
to the way you interact with it every day. And we design our products to work better
together, seamlessly and intuitively. We also design them to be secure
and to protect your privacy. Because you should be the one in control
of how your personal data is used. We applied these principles
when we created HomePod. HomePod is a breakthrough speaker that combines precise, high-fidelity sound
with the intelligence of Siri. It provides an entirely new way to
discover and interact with music at home. And now we want to bring this experience
to even more people. So today, I'm excited to introduce
the newest addition to the HomePod family. And I'd like to show it to you now. ["I'm Ready to Rock That"
by Bonti playing] [volume decreases] This is HomePod mini. And here's Bob to tell you all about it. [music continues] I'm so excited to tell you
about HomePod mini. It's an incredible smart speaker, with a compact, elegant design
that's perfect for your home. It's wrapped in a beautiful, seamless
mesh fabric that not only looks great, but was created specifically
for its acoustic performance. On top of HomePod mini
is a backlit touch surface that provides controls
for volume, play/pause, and even illuminates when you invoke Siri. But the design is just the beginning. In creating HomePod mini, we thought carefully about
what you want from a smart speaker. First, you want amazing sound
that ensures your music, podcasts and everything you listen to
sounds incredible. Next, you want a world-class
intelligent assistant that helps you wherever you are. And as our homes become smarter, you want it to serve
as the brain of your smart home, orchestrating and controlling
a wide range of devices. And finally, because it's your home,
you want a smart speaker that puts your privacy
and security at the forefront. All this is exactly what HomePod mini
is designed to deliver. And to tell you more
about how we made this happen, let me pass it to Dave and Yael. At Apple, we have a passion for music, so we knew HomePod mini
had to sound amazing. We started by custom-designing
every acoustic element. We created a full-range dynamic driver that delivers high output
while keeping distortion to a minimum and developed a pair of high-excursion,
force-cancelling passive radiators that enable amazing bass response. We also crafted an acoustic waveguide to deliver a consistent,
360-degree sound experience, enabling you to place
HomePod mini anywhere. In order to get truly big sound
out of this compact design, we combined it
with the powerful Apple S5 chip and advanced software which all together
enables something we call... computational audio. Even before you hear the first note, HomePod mini is analyzing
the unique characteristics of the music and applying complex tuning models
to optimize loudness, adjust the dynamic range, and control the movement of the driver
and passive radiators in real time. And all this happens
over 180 times a second. The result is an audio experience
unheard of in a speaker this size and one only Apple can deliver. Now, bringing amazing sound into your home isn't just about
breakthrough audio quality. It's also about letting you
enjoy that sound throughout your house. Multiple HomePod mini speakers can play perfectly in sync
across your entire house. That's great for entertaining or keeping up with your favorite podcast
as you get stuff done. And when you place two in the same room, they'll intelligently
become a stereo pair, filling your space
with rich, enveloping sound. ["Ferris Wheel" by Sylvan Esso playing] And to make HomePod mini the ultimate smart speaker
for iPhone owners, later this year, you'll get a new
Handoff experience that's truly magical. Using the U1 Ultra Wideband chip, which we introduced in iPhone last year, HomePod mini can understand,
with high precision, when your iPhone is nearby. Bring iPhone close to HomePod mini and you'll get visual, audible
and haptic effects... [hip-hop playing] ...so it feels like your devices
are physically connected as music flows from one to the other. And of course, HomePod mini
can play all of your favorite content. In addition to Apple Music, you can listen to
all your favorite podcasts, along with thousands of radio stations from iHeartRadio, RADIO.COM and TuneIn. And in the coming months, you'll be able to use services
from providers like Pandora and Amazon. And because HomePod mini
has the power of Siri, anyone in the home can ask
to play an artist, album or track, hear a playlist,
or even search for music by lyrics. Hey Siri, play the song that goes,
"feeling good, never stressed." Here's "Sunday Best" by Surfaces. [upbeat music playing] Siri on HomePod mini
brings you the music you love and helps you discover new favorites. But of course, Siri does more
than just play your favorite music. To tell you more, here's Yael. Siri is what makes a smart speaker,
well, smart. Siri was the first mainstream
intelligent assistant, and today
it's the most popular in the world, available on over a billion devices and handling over 25 billion requests
a month. And Siri keeps getting better. In the past three years,
Siri's gotten faster and more concise. Speech recognition is twice as accurate. And Siri knows over 20 times more facts. Together, Siri and HomePod mini do everything you'd expect
from a smart speaker, from multiple timers and alarms
to weather reports to answering the random questions
kids think up. But what really sets HomePod mini apart is Siri's deep integration with iPhone. Using Siri, HomePod mini
can access the apps on your iPhone to send a message,
check your calendar, make a call, even find your iPhone. And because of this, you'll be able to ask HomePod mini
for a personal update with just a single request. Hey Siri, what's my update? Good morning, Jumi. It's currently sunny and 72 degrees. Your first event is at 11:00 a.m.,
gallery visit. You have one upcoming reminder: call Zoe. Of course, your voice
isn't the only voice in your house. Siri knows that and can recognize the voices
of each member of your household so that everyone gets
their own personal experience. Hey Siri, what's my first class today? Hey Siri, text Anika,
"I'll pick you up in ten." Hey Siri, play my Favorites mix. Okay, Moe. Favorites mix now playing. And deep integration with iPhone also enables a magical experience
with CarPlay. Ask HomePod mini what time Target closes and a Siri suggestion
automatically appears in CarPlay, so when you hop in the car,
the route is ready and waiting for you. With the intelligence of Siri, HomePod mini helps you
get things done around the home. Next, let's turn to the smart home. When it comes to your home,
you want comfort and convenience without complexity. So with HomePod mini,
we've made the smart home simple. HomePod mini automatically
integrates with the Home app so you can control all of your HomeKit
accessories with just your voice. You can ask to turn down the heat, lock the doors, dim the lights, or even set a scene... [Jumi] Hey Siri, good morning. Good morning. The scene is set. [Garten] ...to control multiple
accessories with a single voice command. And if you're just getting started
with your smart home, the new Discover Tab in the Home app makes it easy to find
all kinds of great smart home accessories to control lighting,
security, comfort and more. One of the most important parts
of the smart home is communicating with your family, which is why we created... Intercom. Intercom lets you quickly
send a message from one HomePod to another in a different room or to multiple rooms throughout your home. Hey Siri, tell everyone,
"We're late. Let's go!" [HomePod mini chimes] [Moe] We're late. Let's go! Hey Siri, reply,
"I'm just getting my jacket." But what's really exciting
is that we've taken it a step further and designed Intercom
to also work with your iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch and even CarPlay, something only Apple can do. You'll get a home intercom system
that goes everywhere with you. [Moe] Ask everyone,
"Who's hungry? I've got pizza." [Garten]
The message will automatically play on HomePod speakers throughout the home, and a notification will appear
on your family's personal devices. And Intercom messages
will play on AirPods as well, so you can always
get your kid's attention. Reply, "You read my mind." ["JEWELZ" by Anderson .Paak playing] Intercom helps connect
the members of your home in an entirely new way. We're so excited about how HomePod mini brings the power of Siri intelligence
to your smart home. Back to Bob. Not only is HomePod mini
packed with great features, like every Apple product it's designed with your privacy
and security in mind. Nothing you say is sent out of your home
until you activate Siri with a touch or it hears those magic words, "Hey Siri." And your requests
are not associated with your Apple ID, and you choose whether Apple
saves your audio recordings. Personal requests only work
when your iPhone is home with you, and all communication with smart home
accessories uses strong encryption. We can't wait for you to enjoy
the incredible experiences the new HomePod mini brings to your home. It comes in both white and space gray, and I'm thrilled to announce
that HomePod mini will be available for just $99. And you can order HomePod mini
November 6th, and it will start shipping
the week of November 16th. So that's HomePod mini. With the power of computational audio, a world-class intelligent assistant, great features like Intercom and tight integration
with your favorite Apple devices. And now back to Tim. Now let's talk about iPhone. iPhone is an incredibly powerful
and personal device. It's the product we use the most
every day. With amazing capabilities,
iPhone has changed our lives and has never been
more indispensable than it is now. It's been another big year for iPhone. Ever since its launch, iPhone 11 has been
the most popular smartphone in the world. People love their iPhones. iPhone has led the industry
in customer satisfaction every year since it was first introduced. There's so much that people
love about their iPhones. They love how easy it is to use, how it connects people in personal ways, how it elevates photography, keeps us informed
and keeps us entertained. With a powerful ecosystem of apps
in the App Store, iPhone enables people to do
more and more things every day. And users can trust that iPhone
is designed to do all of this while protecting
their security and privacy. Every decade,
there's a new generation of technology that provides a step change
in what we can do with our iPhones. The next generation is here. Today is the beginning
of a new era for iPhone. Today we're bringing 5G to iPhone. This is a huge moment for all of us,
and we're really excited. 5G will bring a new level of performance
for downloads and uploads, higher quality video streaming,
more responsive gaming, real-time interactivity and so much more. 5G networks are more advanced, with lower latency
and less network congestion. So you can get higher network speeds
even in densely populated areas. And 5G even helps protect
your privacy and security, since you won't need to connect
to unknown, unsecured, public Wi-Fi hotspots as often. Each generation
of cellular network technology on iPhone has enabled breakthrough innovations and entirely new opportunities
for our developers and our users. And 5G is the most exciting step yet. For so many people, this all becomes real
with 5G coming to iPhone. As you know,
iPhone provides seamless integration of world-class hardware
and world-class software. What you may not know about
is the incredible collaboration between Apple and our carrier partners
around the world to ensure iPhone users
get the best possible experience. We're fortunate today to have
one of our closest partners join us. I'd like to welcome Hans Vestberg,
Chairman and CEO of Verizon, here to Apple Park. Hans, this really is a big day. And our teams have done
some amazing work together. I want to thank you
and the whole Apple team for a fantastic collaboration
leading up to this historic moment. Until now, most people have taken
a "wait and see" approach to 5G. They've been waiting for 5G to get real... with the network coverage they expect, the incredible performance
they have been promised, and the devices they love. Well, today with iPhone, the wait is over. 5G just got real. Of course,
what's the most exciting part for me as a guy who has worked in networking
for 25-plus years? That fact that for the first time ever, iPhone can now access
Verizon's 5G Ultra Wideband. It's built with large quantities
of mmWave spectrum that enable unprecedented performance. 5G Ultra Wideband
has already been recognized as being the fastest 5G in the world. And it's getting even faster. Our 5G network now gives you
double the peak download speeds: over 4 gigabits per seconds today
in ideal conditions and even higher over time. And double the upload speeds
at over 200 megabits per second. So whenever you're watching
a high-definition movie or you're planning business workflows
with real-time augmented reality, you can be sure that
there's no faster 5G anywhere on earth. 5G Ultra Wideband has, also,
a massive capacity. We're building it to help remove
bottlenecks in crowded places where thousands of people
use their phones at the same time. Because one day
we'll be safely back in those places. And so, we're nearly doubling
our 5G-enabled stadiums, venues, airports, train stations, and lighting up some of
the busiest locations in the country. This enables amazing things, like reinventing
the in-stadium fan experience with our NFL partners. The new Verizon 5G SuperStadium
experience in the NFL app lets fans see and feel the action from up to seven camera angles,
including views from players' eyes, and an immersive augmented reality
like never before. We're excited for NFL
to be rolling this out to many stadiums through the course of the season. And finally, 5G Ultra Wideband
provides you with super low latency, so experiences like multiplayer gaming feel like they're happening
in near real time, freed from the confines of your home. Together with Apple, Verizon has partnered with one of
the world's leading gaming companies for some exciting news
that you'll hear about later today. To make this incredible experience
available to more people, we're doubling down
on our fastest network, the 5G Ultra Wideband, with double the coverage
in existing cities like New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and expanding into new cities
like Philadelphia and San Francisco, with 60 cities by year-end. In addition to our
5G Ultra Wideband network, we have an extensive 5G network. And today, we're excited to announce that Verizon is turning on
our 5G Nationwide network, reaching more than 200 million people
across more than 1,800 cities and towns. So, all of the pieces
have now come together: the coverage of 5G Nationwide, the unprecedented performance of
5G Ultra Wideband in more and more cities, the reliability you expect from Verizon. With the first 5G iPhone
on the 5G America has been waiting for, we can finally say, 5G just got real. Hans, this is definitely
the start of something big. Thank you for joining us, and thank you for all the great work
we're doing together. We are very excited about 5G on iPhone, and we're going to introduce 5G across our entire lineup
of new iPhone models today. So now I'd like to show you
the very first iPhone with 5G. Introducing iPhone 12. To tell you all about it,
I'd like to hand it over to Kaiann. Let's take a closer look
at iPhone 12 with 5G. It has an all-new design
that's simply stunning. It has smooth, flat edges, allowing the aluminum frame and glass
to stay flush, front and back, creating this unique uniform construction. Inside and out, iPhone was re-architected to pack in new technologies
into a smaller form factor. iPhone 12 was designed with 5G in mind, including the position of all-new antennas
which go around the aluminum frame. The design looks amazing
in five stunning new colors: black, white, (PRODUCT)RED, green
and a gorgeous blue. iPhone 12 features the same great
6.1-inch display size as iPhone 11, yet we reduced the display borders
to create a much smaller iPhone. If we compare it to iPhone 11, iPhone 12 is 11% thinner, 15% smaller in volume and 16% lighter. Keeping the display size and
reducing the footprint was only possible by bringing our best display technology
to iPhone 12. And that is our Super Retina XDR display. Our new Apple-custom OLED
has many advantages over LCD. Each OLED pixel has its own light
which can be individually controlled, giving us pixel-precision brightness,
rich colors and an amazing two-million-to-one
contrast ratio for true blacks in photos, videos, games. And Dark Mode looks fantastic. The new OLED display
also has a higher resolution, with twice as many pixels as iPhone 11. It now has 460 pixels per inch. So text will be sharper
for easier reading, and your photos will look better, with more detail, increased dynamic range
and precise color. And peak brightness is nearly twice
as high for HDR content: 1,200 nits, and we include support
for HDR video formats: Dolby Vision, HDR10 and HLG. We obsess over
making your display impeccable, and of course it's important that
we protect your display in the best way. The cover glass on iPhone 11
is the toughest in the industry, but iPhone 12 leaps ahead
with something even better. Much better. Our incredible Materials Engineering team has been working closely
with our partners at Corning, the leaders in glass technology, on a new cutting-edge material. And we call it Ceramic Shield. Ceramic Shield goes beyond glass by adding a new high-temperature
crystallization step which grows nanoceramic crystals
within the glass matrix to dramatically improve toughness. To make this material
both tough and optically clear, we precisely control the type of crystals and degree of crystallinity. This was the breakthrough that made
Ceramic Shield possible for iPhone. Ceramic Shield is tougher
than any smartphone glass, and along with our new design
it makes iPhone more durable than ever. We measured four times
better drop performance. That means if your iPhone
accidentally slips out of your pocket, Ceramic Shield will have four times
the chance of surviving without cracking. This is the biggest jump in reliability
we've ever had on iPhone, and we are thrilled
to bring that to iPhone 12. Let's talk more about
the 5G capability on iPhone 12. As Tim said, to create
the best possible 5G experience it required seamless integration
of hardware and software, and partnering closely with carriers. Here's Arun to tell you more. I'm here in one of our
50 world-class anechoic chambers where we develop and test
advanced wireless capabilities like 5G. And we approach this differently
than anyone else. Starting with hardware, we designed
custom 5G antennas and radio components that allow us to target exactly
what works best in the entire system. We can be very space efficient while also including the most 5G bands
in a single phone, to work on 5G in more places
than any other smartphone. Another Apple advantage is our ability
to engineer a fully integrated system from silicon to software. We analyzed our entire software stack
from applications down to firmware to take advantage of 5G speeds. For example, we optimized iOS frameworks, so apps can get the benefit of 5G
without using more power. 5G makes iPhone faster. We also made 5G smarter
with Smart Data mode. When your iPhone doesn't need 5G speeds, it automatically uses LTE to save battery. But the instant 5G speeds do matter,
iPhone starts using it. We also conduct rigorous validation. For example,
this custom-built anechoic chamber helps us replicate signals
from multiple sources and directions. We use this data
to optimize our antenna system and our unique beamforming algorithms. To deliver 5G around the world, we collaborate closely
with carrier partners, ensuring iPhone has great throughput, coverage, call quality and battery life. We've completed 5G testing
on over 100 carriers in over 30 regions, and we're seeing impressive peak speeds
on iPhone 12. Up to 3.5 gigabits per second
in ideal conditions. Of course, 5G speeds will vary
by carrier and region. In the US, we also support mmWave, the high frequency version of 5G
on all iPhone 12 models. This includes support for
Verizon's 5G Ultra Wideband network. This technology is ideal
for densely populated areas and crowded stadiums. With wider bandwidth,
it can deliver even higher speeds. In fact, we have measured over
4 gigabits per second in ideal conditions and up to 1 gigabit per second
in typical conditions. This is just the beginning, and we're excited to offer iPhone users
the best possible 5G experience. Now back to Kaiann. Now let's talk about the chip
that powers the new iPhone. The A13 Bionic on iPhone 11
is still the fastest chip in a smartphone. That's until now. We have a new chip developed
by our world-class silicon team: A14 Bionic, the fastest chip
ever in a smartphone. Let me quickly take you
to our secret chip lab where Hope will tell you all about it. [beeping] And finally, here's Hope. Every year, iPhone sets the standard
for mobile performance, even challenging
the performance of laptops. This year, A14 Bionic also marks a very important milestone
in the history of iPhone. A14 Bionic
is the first smartphone chip in the world built on the latest
5-nanometer process technology. The reduction in transistor size
enables us to add features and increase performance, all while improving energy efficiency. Our Silicon Engineering team has packed 11.8 billion transistors
into A14 Bionic, an increase of nearly 40% compared to A13. A14 improves performance and efficiency
across the entire design of the chip, starting with the CPU. The new 6-core CPU in A14
is the fastest CPU in any smartphone. In fact, it's up to 50% faster. A14 also features
our latest 4-core GPU design, driving increased image quality
and overall efficiency, so it's even better for advanced games
and machine learning. And compared to the competition,
it's the fastest GPU in any smartphone, delivering up to 50% faster graphics. We've also made
significant architectural changes that push the limits of ML processing, a critical design investment
to enable new experiences. We've dramatically increased
the performance of our Neural Engine by growing from 8 to 16 cores. This change delivers
up to 80% faster performance on the most critical
machine learning models. This new Neural Engine is capable of an astounding
11 trillion operations per second. And we've also increased the performance
of our CPU's dedicated ML accelerators, now 70% faster, so our developers benefit from considerably improved ML performance
on our entire chip. Our silicon powers
every experience on the iPhone, and with A14 Bionic
we make those experiences even better with big updates to our CPU, GPU and a dramatic increase
in machine learning capabilities. Back to Kaiann. A14 Bionic enables console-quality games. With the faster speeds
and lower latency of 5G, multiplayer gaming gets even better. Later this year, one of the best games
of all time is coming to iPhone. It has held the prestigious title of most popular, most played
and most viewed game in the world and revolutionized e-sports with over 100 million people
watching the world championship last year. I'm, of course,
talking about League of Legends. Using the power of the new A14 Bionic and Verizon's 5G Ultra Wideband network, iPhone gaming
is taking an enormous leap forward. Here's Michael Chow,
executive producer from Riot Games, to tell you more about it. At Riot, we aspire to make games
that meet our players wherever they are. League of Legends
is the world's most popular PC game. But now with the insanely powerful
iPhone 12 and Verizon 5G, we believe it's the perfect time
to bring League to iOS. This is League of Legends: Wild Rift. The power of A14 Bionic
literally blew us away. It allows us to show off champions
like Ashe with a brand-new level of fidelity
that you can't find on any other platform. With off-the-charts GPU performance
and frames per second, you get amazing details
and fluid gameplay, even in the most chaotic team fights. On iPhone 12, gameplay is always
responsive and unbelievably smooth. Until now, to be competitive
in League of Legends, you had to be tied to your desk. But Verizon 5G frees you
to game like a pro pretty much anywhere, no Wi-Fi required. And with wicked-fast speeds
up to 25 times today's networks, not only is gameplay fast,
but so are downloads. So you can instantly grab dope new skins that show off all your favorite champs. We'll see you on the Wild Rift. Wow! What a huge moment for mobile gaming. We can't wait to play League of Legends
on iPhone 12. A14 Bionic also combines
with our cameras and powerful software to deliver the new dual-camera system
of iPhone 12. It has the Ultra Wide camera
that people love and use to take inspiring photos
in creative ways. iPhone 12 also has a new Wide camera with an f/1.6 aperture, our fastest yet. This allows more light to hit the sensor,
making every photo better. Along with the wider aperture, we developed our first 7-element lens to maintain sharp detail in your photo
from edge to edge. This delivers a 27% improvement
in low-light performance, so photos and videos all around
will have less noise and brighter results. Like in this photo, with fantastic detail
in her hair, clothing, and the sun's reflection. On top of this,
we use computational photography to deliver
even more powerful new features. Our Smart HDR 3
continues to bring out details in faces, like you see here
when the sun is so bright behind her. Now it understands scenes
with machine learning and applies more adjustments
to distinct parts of the photo. For example, Smart HDR 3
brings out more detail in the rocks and uses sky segmentation
to adjust for color, contrast and noise. Computational photography
also enables Night mode, which has been called
the best in the industry. Night mode on iPhone 12 gets even better. The faster aperture captures more light. And now, we are expanding Night mode
to all cameras of iPhone 12, for the first time on the Ultra Wide and front TrueDepth camera,
which is perfect for Night mode selfies. This is without a flash. These cameras are incredible. Let's take a look at other photos
shot on iPhone 12. This photo makes use
of the Ultra Wide lens while maintaining sharpness and clarity
like you see in the branches and leaves. Here's another Ultra Wide photo,
shot from below. Just look at the amazing details
in the clothing and chandeliers. In this low-light portrait photo, the color and warm light in the background
come together seamlessly. For video,
iPhone continues to lead the industry with the highest-quality video. And with the larger aperture,
iPhone 12 video will get even better, with big improvements in lower light. We're adding Night mode time-lapse, with longer exposure and brighter frames
when using a tripod. We wanted to show you iPhone 12 in action, so here's a video we shot and edited
entirely on iPhone 12. ["Why iii Love the Moon"
by Phony Ppl playing] With an amazing camera on the go
and 5G speeds, iPhone 12 takes us
into an even more wireless world. We love wireless charging,
but want to improve the experience. When setting down your phone, you can
miss the exact center of the charger, which can result in slow,
less efficient charging, or none at all. So with iPhone 12,
we are making this so much better. But that's not all. Introducing MagSafe for iPhone. To tell you more, here's Deniz. MagSafe is an advanced new system. It starts by improving
the wireless charging experience. Our wound wire coil,
which is unique in the industry, now accommodates magnets and maintains compatibility
with existing Qi chargers. The magnets are optimized
for alignment and efficiency. And we improved our shielding design to safely provide up to 15 watts
for faster charging. We use a custom nanocrystalline shield
to capture magnetic flux. We also added two new sensors: a single-turn coil NFC
and a sensitive magnetometer, which senses magnetic field strength
and can instantly react to it. This enables iPhone 12
to recognize and provide a better experience for accessories. Any MagSafe accessory
can simply snap onto the back of iPhone. So, this is really great. We're enabling a whole new ecosystem
for MagSafe, starting with all-new cases for iPhone 12: silicone, clear, leather... which have magnets to snap on and off,
and they're far easier to use. And you can use other MagSafe accessories
on top of the cases, like the MagSafe charger. And there's a MagSafe wallet.
It just snaps to the back of iPhone and also works on top of MagSafe cases. The leather sleeve uses MagSafe sensors to identify when iPhone is inside
to reveal the clock. We also developed
the new MagSafe Duo Charger for your iPhone and Apple Watch. You can charge both devices
with one charger, and it folds up easily
for when you travel. And these are just the accessories
we are introducing. Belkin is already working
on a couple of new accessories: a car mount and a multi-charger dock. We can't wait to see the innovative ways
that others will use MagSafe, creating a robust
and ever-expanding ecosystem. Back to you, Kaiann. We also have some big
environmental news for iPhone. To tell you more, here's Lisa. Today, Apple is carbon neutral
for our global corporate operations. Our offices, stores and data centers
run on 100% renewable energy. And we're proud of how far we've come. But by 2030, we plan to have net zero
climate impact across our entire business, including our manufacturing supply chain
and all product life cycles. This means that every Apple device sold, from material collection,
component manufacturing, assembly, transport,
customer use, charging, all the way through recycling
and material recovery will be 100% carbon neutral. Many of iPhone 12's environmental features
build on our past progress, removing harmful chemicals and using
renewable and recyclable materials. And now, for the first time, we are using 100% recycled
rare earth elements in all magnets, including the camera, haptics and MagSafe. We've also been transitioning
our iPhone manufacturing partners to renewable energy. And just like we did with Apple Watch, we looked for ways to cut waste
and use less material. Customers already have over 700 million
Lightning headphones. And many customers have moved
to a wireless experience with AirPods, Beats
or other wireless headphones. And there are also over two billion
Apple power adapters out in the world, and that's not counting the billions
of third-party adapters. So we are removing these items
from the iPhone box, which reduces carbon emissions and avoids the mining and use
of precious materials. Removing these items also means
a smaller, lighter iPhone box. We can fit up to 70% more products
on a shipping pallet, reducing carbon emissions
in our global logistics chain. Taken altogether,
the changes we've made for iPhone 12 cut over two million metric tons
of carbon emissions annually. It's like removing 450,000 cars
from the road per year. This is huge, and we're really proud
that Apple is taking the lead. We hope others will follow, making this impact
even bigger for our planet. Back to you, Kaiann. Now every iPhone will include
the more advanced and higher power USB-C to Lightning Cable. It can be used with any standard
USB-C power adapter or computer port. And USB-C enables fast charging. So that's iPhone 12 with 5G. But to add to all these big announcements, we also wanted to do something
a little different. ["James Bond Theme" playing] Something only Apple would do. [music continues] [beeps] [beeps] This is iPhone 12 mini. With its amazing size,
it fits in the palm of your hand, while still keeping the expansive
edge-to-edge Super Retina XDR display. It's smaller and lighter than
our 4.7-inch models like iPhone 8, but with a larger 5.4-inch display
that lets you see so much more. With its compact size, the iPhone 12 mini has
the exact same features as iPhone 12. You're just choosing
between two great sizes. In fact, iPhone 12 mini
is the smallest, thinnest and lightest 5G phone in the world. With its large screen and compact size, we think this will be
an incredibly popular iPhone. Everything on iPhone 12
and iPhone 12 mini is the latest: 5G, the fastest chip with A14 Bionic, most advanced display with OLED, all-new design with Ceramic Shield, even better water resistance,
new cameras for low light, and MagSafe. Let's see everything iPhone 12 can do. ["Eat Them Apples" by Suzi Wu playing] [camera shutter clicking] Even with these huge updates, the iPhone 12 lineup will start
at just $699 for iPhone 12 mini and $799 for iPhone 12. We also have great financing options
from Apple as well as our partners. This includes a very special offer
from Verizon. If you trade in an iPhone X or newer, you can get iPhone 12 starting at $15 per month for 24 months, or iPhone 12 mini for just $12 per month. This is an unprecedented leap forward
for iPhone. There is simply nothing like iPhone 12. Back to you, Tim. iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini
are absolutely amazing. They are the start of a new era
for iPhone. Yet that's just half
of our iPhone story today. We want to take it even further
with our pro line of iPhones. And here they are. This is iPhone 12 Pro. I'd like to hand it over to Joz
to tell you all about it. iPhone 12 Pro is designed for our users who want
the absolute most from their iPhone. It takes our new design even further
with premium materials. This includes a durable and beautiful
surgical-grade stainless steel band and precision-milled back glass. They come in four new finishes,
including an elegant silver, a rich, deep graphite, a stunning gold and an all-new Pacific Blue. They're engineered
with an advanced PVD process that provides a spectacular luster. And our new gold uses a high-power
magnetron coating process that gives the stainless steel
a stunning bright gold finish. The pro models also feature
our incredibly durable Ceramic Shield. And these models have best-in-class
water and dust resistance with an IP68 rating, so they can withstand submersion
at up to six meters for 30 minutes. The pro design is complemented beautifully
with our new MagSafe accessories which provide easy and secure attachment
and high-power charging. iPhone 12 Pro features our industry-leading
Super Retina XDR displays. We were able to go from today's 5.8-inch
to a much larger 6.1-inch display. And iPhone 12 Pro Max increases
from today's 6.5-inch to a more expansive 6.7-inch display. We were able to grow these displays but keep the form factors
nearly identical. So for people who want
our biggest displays, this is the largest display ever
in an iPhone, with our highest resolution, featuring nearly
three and a half million pixels. HDR video comes to life. High-resolution HDR movies and TV shows
that you stream over 5G will look amazing. Our pro models are packed
with pro-level performance. While our competition is scrambling
to catch up with our chips from last year, we remain generations ahead. And our advantages
go beyond the CPU and GPU. Together with our Image Signal Processor,
or ISP, they enable powerful computational
photography for camera experiences that simply are not possible
with traditional cameras. For example, Deep Fusion uses
machine learning on the Neural Engine for pixel-by-pixel processing of photos with unprecedented detail, texture
and minimal noise. To accomplish this, Deep Fusion uses
all the compute engines of the A14. Our camera sensor captures multiple images and processes them through the ISP. The CPU computes
the alignment of the frames. The GPU pre-processes the images before running them through
the Neural Engine. And then there's additional
post-processing done in the GPU. With A14 Bionic, we are able to bring
Deep Fusion to all four cameras of iPhone 12 Pro, including the front-facing
TrueDepth camera. We combine state-of-the-art
camera hardware with this amazing compute power to create a pro camera system
that is unlike any other device. iPhone 12 Pro features
our amazing Ultra Wide camera with a 120-degree field of view, and our new Wide camera
with faster f/1.6 aperture and 7-element lens
that lets in 27% more light. iPhone 12 Pro also features a 52 mm
Telephoto camera for stunning portraits. So iPhone 12 Pro delivers
high-quality optical images at three different focal lengths, with a 4x optical zoom range. The larger size of the iPhone 12 Pro Max provided us with an opportunity to do
even more with our pro camera system. And here's Andrew
to tell you all about it. In iPhone 12 Pro Max, we've been able
to create our best camera ever. We have a brand-new Telephoto camera
with a 65 mm focal length. Moving from a 52 mm focal length
to a 65 mm allows for longer framing
in the classic portrait style. With the new Telephoto, you can now
optically zoom in two and a half times for even closer shots or tighter crops, which means improving
to a 5x optical zoom range from the Ultra Wide's 13 mm
to the Telephoto's 65 mm. iPhone 12 Pro Max features
an all-new massive Wide camera with an f/1.6 aperture, a new sensor and new system for
Optical Image Stabilization, or OIS. Let me first tell you
about the new sensor. It's 47% larger,
with 1.7 micron pixels, our largest yet. Larger pixels plus a faster aperture gives iPhone 12 Pro Max an incredible 87% improvement
in low light, which is our biggest leap
in light gathering capability. On top of that,
we developed a completely new system for optical image stabilization that adopts a high-end DSLR approach
called sensor-shift. Sensor-shift applies stabilization
to the sensor instead of the heavier lens to precisely control motion in X and Y
while maintaining sharpness. This cancels both low
and high-frequency disturbances like hand movement or vibrations in a car. In addition, the OIS
on all our Wide cameras this year can now make 5,000
micro adjustments per second, which is five times more than last year. Along with motion processing advancements, we get stabilized exposure times
of up to two seconds in low light for handheld shots, equal to a full f-stop increase
in light gathering. This sensor-shift system
is unique to Apple and helps people capture
everyday situations with extraordinary images. And it delivers steady video
with a truly cinematic feel. Now here's my colleague Alok
to tell you more about another feature we created for our pro users. These are amazing cameras for pros, and we want
to give our pros even more control over the images they capture. Many pros love to capture in RAW, but they're missing the benefit
of our sophisticated image fusion. So we'd like to show you a sneak peek
of a new feature that combines the control
of shooting in RAW with the power
of our computational photography. And that's Apple ProRAW. This will be
an incredible feature for pros and will be available
in the iPhone Camera app on iPhone 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max
later this year. It provides many of the benefits
of our multi-frame image processing and computational photography, like Deep Fusion and Smart HDR, and combines them with the depth
and flexibility of a RAW format. In order to achieve this,
we constructed a new pipeline that takes components of the processing we do in our CPU, GPU, ISP
and Neural Engine and combines them
into a new Deep Image file computed at the time of capture
without any shutter delay. And we do this for all four cameras, dynamically adapting for various scenes while maintaining
our intuitive camera experience. Things like sharpening, white balance
and tone mapping become instructions
rather than being baked into the photo, delivering full creative control
over color, detail and dynamic range. Here you can see a photo
shot with Apple ProRAW. Notice how it's taken full advantage
of Deep Fusion to capture a wide range of light
and shadow from multiple exposures. Because all the data is contained
in Apple ProRAW, this image can be processed
in various ways while retaining the crisp,
beautifully rendered detail. You can edit Apple ProRAW
directly in our Photos app and other professional photo editing apps. We're also creating an API
for third-party apps to capture images in Apple ProRAW. This is really the best of both worlds. The flexibility of RAW with the power
of Apple's computational photography. And now, back to Joz. iPhone 12 Pro allows you
to take absolutely stunning photos. Even at dusk, you can see the incredible
color and texture in the shadows. You can see this Ultra Wide shot
preserves the detail in the cracks of the desert floor. You can almost feel it. With Deep Fusion,
you can even see the detail of her dress in this low-light setting. In this classic black-and-white, you can feel the sun glistening
on the horse. On a tripod,
we can take Night mode even further, capturing the pop of color in the tent
as well as the stars in the night sky. Now let's talk about pro video. Year after year, iPhone provides the highest quality video
on a smartphone. Pros use iPhone to shoot TV shows,
news reports and even movies. This has never been more important,
as our homes have become our studios. In fact, for many TV productions,
from American Idol to Mythic Quest, the show has been able to go on
because of iPhone. This year, we're taking pro video further,
much further. For the first time, we're bringing
HDR video recording to iPhone. You can now record
in 10-bit High Dynamic Range. This means we can capture
over 700 million colors. That's 60 times more colors than before. While you capture,
you get a live preview of your HDR content on the Super Retina XDR display. And we're also gonna do something
that no other device in the world can do. iPhone 12 Pro is the first camera to record in Dolby Vision HDR. To accomplish this,
every single frame of 10-bit video runs through our ISP,
generating a histogram and allowing iPhone
to grade each frame in Dolby Vision, live while you're recording. And we can do this at 4K resolution
and 60 frames per second. This is enabled by our Apple custom sensor and the incredible power of the A14, which does the intense processing
of these image algorithms in real time. Prior to today, you needed
a pro studio lab and special equipment to edit your original Dolby Vision footage
and then re-encode your files. iPhone 12 Pro will be the first device
to edit in Dolby Vision, right from the Photos app. You can even apply filters. iPhone will regenerate
the Dolby Vision tuning on the fly. Oscar-winning cinematographer
Emmanuel "Chivo" Lubezki made a film to showcase iPhone 12 Pro
with Dolby Vision, and I'd like to show it to you now. My name is Emmanuel Lubezki.
I am a cinematographer. When I started shooting movies,
you had to rent a very expensive camera, buy film stock, pay for developing, special equipment for editing. Now, you can really go out with
one of these devices and make a movie. The iPhone Pro will allow filmmakers
all around the world to make films that otherwise are impossible
because you don't have the means or because the cameras are too heavy
or too complicated. I think the next great cinematographer
or the next great film director is already making movies
with one of these devices. So iPhone is the first and only device that enables you to capture, edit,
watch and share Dolby Vision video. What an incredible
end-to-end pro video workflow, right from your pocket. And with 5G, sharing your videos
from the field has never been faster. And we have another exciting capability
we're bringing to our new pro iPhones. Here's Francesca to tell you more. We've pushed the industry
with depth technology over the years, and today we continue
that innovation with... a LiDAR scanner. LiDAR stands
for Light Detection and Ranging, and it measures how long it takes light
to reach an object and reflect back. We've adopted this technology for iPhone, and with the machine learning
and depth frameworks of iOS 14, iPhone understands the world around you and builds a precise depth map
of the scene. It enables object and room scanning,
photo and video effects and precise placement of AR objects. LiDAR makes iPhone 12 Pro
a powerful device for delivering instant AR and
unlocking endless opportunities in apps. The LiDAR scanner also takes
our pro camera system to a whole new level. With LiDAR's ability to see in the dark, we use it for autofocus
in low-light scenes, improving accuracy to focus
and reducing capture time. Instead of hunting for focus, the LiDAR scanner
can identify the subject, focus and capture right away. This works in photos and videos. In fact, with LiDAR, we can improve
focus time in low-light scenes by up to six times, so your subject is clearly in focus,
without missing the moment. LiDAR also improves depth
in low light for Night mode, enabling stunning
Night mode portrait shots like this one. Look at the incredible detail in the face, the realistic color throughout the scene and the blooming bokeh
in the lights in the background. And that's the new LiDAR scanner
on iPhone 12 Pro. Now back to Joz. As you can see, iPhone 12 Pro
is loaded with incredible innovations. And when you combine
these advanced capabilities with 5G, it will enable you to do
so much more on the go. And 5G is going to unlock even more
opportunities for our developers. I'd like to show you a couple examples. On-call physicians often need to review
complex medical scans anywhere, anytime. OsiriX HD app and 5G enables them
to download these very large images with lightning-fast speeds. The ability to download
a full diagnostic scan in a matter of seconds versus minutes can make the difference between
life and death for a stroke victim. And enterprise will be able to use
private 5G networks for high reliability and low-latency apps. Like JigSpace, which accelerates
setup of complex work spaces. To set up a medical device
production facility, Medtronic would normally create
a Six Sigma cardboard layout of the space, taking weeks to design
and costing tens of thousands of dollars. And now, with 5G
and the new LiDAR scanner, iPhone 12 Pro enables teams
to immediately map the environment and collaborate with their colleagues to instantly place simulated equipment, adapt it to the room layout
and outline process flows. JigSpace on iPhone 12 Pro
enabled Medtronic to completely transform projects
from weeks to hours, reducing costs by more than 90%. We really pushed the limits with
iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max with stunning new designs
and larger displays. They're packed with
our most innovative technologies like the A14 Bionic chip, LiDAR scanner and incredible pro camera system
powered by computational photography. And now, here's a short film
we created about the iPhone 12 Pro. [man narrating] A singular new design. A reengineered chip. And 5G. This is iPhone 12 Pro. The vertical band is precision-machined
from stainless steel. The Ceramic Shield on the front
is tougher than any smartphone glass. And tighter borders allow for
even larger Super Retina XDR displays. 5G is set to change the world
with radically faster speeds. The hardware and software have been
optimized for the best 5G experience. A14 Bionic has a smaller,
5-nanometer transistor, which pushes the most powerful chip
in a smartphone generations ahead. A new and improved pro camera system makes the 12 Pro
the photographer's iPhone. The larger iPhone 12 Pro Max
pushes these innovations even further. Its bigger sensor
dramatically increases the detail captured and helps improve low-light performance
by 87%. The custom-designed LiDAR scanner puts advanced depth-mapping technology
in your pocket. You can now take a Night mode portrait and unlock a new world of possibilities
for augmented reality. iPhone 12 Pro smashes the benchmark
for highest quality video in a smartphone. The movie industry can now count on it
as an essential piece of equipment. It is the world's first device
able to capture, play back and edit 10-bit HDR footage with Dolby Vision. iPhone 12 Pro comes in two sizes and in four finishes,
including new Pacific Blue. An integral part of this year's design
is MagSafe, an intelligent system of magnets that
connect accessories in a whole new way. All this and more make the iPhone 12 Pro
the most powerful iPhone ever. Even with all of these incredible
pro technologies, we are keeping the price
the same as today, with iPhone 12 Pro starting at $999. And we're doubling the starting capacity
to 128 GB. And iPhone 12 Pro Max,
with our best cameras ever, at $1,099. We're rolling out 5G to more than
100 carriers around the world. This is our fastest rollout ever. iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro
will be available for pre-order this Friday, October 16th, and available next week on October 23rd. iPhone 12 Pro Max and iPhone 12 mini
will be available for pre-order starting on Friday, November 6th, and they will begin shipping
the following week, on November 13th. So this is our new iPhone lineup, starting with iPhone SE at just $399, and iPhone 11 is now just $599. Now back to Tim. Wow, what an amazing day. This is the day
we've all been looking forward to. It's remarkable to think about
where iPhone started and where it is today. Now with support
for high-performance 5G networks, the powerhouse A14 chip, Super Retina XDR displays
with Ceramic Shield, MagSafe and breakthrough camera systems
that even record Dolby Vision video. And pro models that take the experience
further with a pro design, four incredible cameras, LiDAR scanner and the largest display
we've ever shipped in an iPhone. We've come so far with a device
that is so important to our daily lives. This marks the start
of a new era for iPhone. And we announced HomePod mini, with computational audio,
the power of Siri, and a simple and private
smart home experience all in a beautiful, compact design. At Apple, we put the user
at the center of everything we do. It means so much to us to create products
that make a difference in people's lives. Products that make things simpler,
easier and more enjoyable. And we couldn't be
more proud of these products and the amazing teams
who made it all possible. Thank you for joining us, stay safe, and have a great day. ["Good Day for Dreaming"
by Ruelle playing] (ethereal music) - Welcome to Apple's walled garden, where the company's hardware and software and services have formed these
very high walls around you so you can never leave. If you own an iPhone and at
least one other Apple gadget, you live here with me, in this
metaphorical walled garden, which for journalistic purposes brought us to this real walled garden. In tech, a walled garden is a
closed ecosystem of products and with antitrust scrutiny and the Epic versus Apple lawsuit, lately you hear a lot about Apple's- - [Reporter] Walled garden. Walled garden. Walled garden! - [Jennifer] To lock in
users to its walled garden. So how did Apple's walls get so high? And is it even a bad thing that it's difficult to climb out and explore products from other companies like Google, Samsung, and Microsoft? When did these walls get so high? Come take a garden tour with me. I'm gonna help you understand. This real walled garden,
here in Yonkers, New York, has many different
areas, just like Apple's. Let's start here at the entrance
with your Apple hardware. Without it, you can't enter the garden. No, these sections are not to scale, definitely not according to Apple revenue. Your journey into the garden
likely started with an iPhone. Then you bought an Apple Watch or AirPods because they worked so
well with the iPhone. And maybe you also have
an iPad or MacBook. And now you're here forever. Many companies like Samsung and Google have families of products too, but what makes Apple
stronger is its full control of the next part of the garden. This big section here is Apple's software. That means iOS, MacOS,
and WatchOS, and iPadOS. All of these have Apple-only features that tie them together
to work better together. They don't work with Android
phones or Windows computers. The list is long, but let's look at a few. There's iCloud. This syncs all your photos, documents, notes, et cetera across devices. There's AirDrop. This makes it easy to share a file from one Apple device to another. There's AirPlay. This makes it easier
to play music or video, say Apple TV+'s own "Ted Lasso", from an Apple device on
another Apple device. There's the underlying continuity. This lets you hand off a web page, email, or another activity quickly from your iPhone on another Apple device. And then there's the
ultimate one, iMessage. Apple's messaging system lets
you send and receive messages and stickers and games and
money, but only on Apple devices and to people with Apple devices. It's the ultimate blue bubble wall. The final big area of the
garden, Apple services. In this first services area, you have everything from Apple TV+, what's a computer, to Apple
Music to Apple Fitness+ Pushups, here they are, everyone. With most of these, you have to pay more in the form of monthly subscriptions. Good thing I'm in this garden by myself. And Apple often uses its
power over the platform to persuade you. For instance, this perpetual
pop-up in my settings menu. Some of these services are available for other gardens, like
Android or Windows, but the experience is always
better on an Apple device. And then there's one very big
service here, the App Store. Think of it as a large pool
inside a walled garden. The iOS App Store is the
only app store allowed on iPhones and iPads. There are lots of apps in the
pool, but Apple's the fish, eating 15% to 30% of paid app revenue and even digital in-app purchases. Oh, that one's eating 30% of
that app revenue right there. This has been at the heart of complaints from other tech companies,
like in the Epic Games lawsuit. Zoom out to see the whole map and it's quite the business lesson. Every part keeps you with Apple and spending more money with Apple. The first third is what gets you in. The second, where it
gets you to start using and buying even more from section one. The third, you buy more stuff, except it's digital stuff on your devices. Study that if you want to build the next $2 trillion company. So you can see as the garden grows, the walls grow higher and higher, so it's even harder to get out of here. But is it really all that bad? It's called a walled garden because the stuff inside is
very pretty and works great, so you may not even want
a peek over the wall to see what Samsung or
Microsoft or Google has on the other side. And Apple argues that many of its walls protect user privacy and security. Specifically, it says
it's walled App Store keeps out malware and other bad actors. The not-so-great stuff starts to show when you try to bring a
competitor into the garden, (ominous distorted wind whooshing) (whispers) Android. say switching to a Windows
laptop or an Android phone. The serenity of the
garden can be disrupted. Since there's no iMessage
for Android, for instance, you can suddenly miss out
on contacts or even groups. In fact, in an internal email surfaced in the Epic versus Apple
trial, an Apple executive said, "iMessage on Android would simply serve "to remove an obstacle "to iPhone families giving
their kids Android phones." Hey, if Apple's garden is so good, why does it need these
walls to keep us in? There's also the argument
that it stifles innovation. If Apple keeps making its
own versions of products, do we miss out on new
ideas and innovations? And when it comes to the
App Store swimming pool, developers argue Apple is
unfairly abusing its power to charge developers more. While the legal battles about
this garden will play out in anti-trust suits and more
over the next few years, there are a few ways Apple
users can poke little holes in Apple's garden walls. If there's a good alternative
to an Apple service, like Spotify for Apple
Music, give it a real chance. You shouldn't just choose to use services because they're right
there on our devices. Then if you pay for a subscription
through the App Store, find out what the app
charges on its own website for the same service. You could get a surprise discount. Also, Apple has over the years allowed you to change your default
web browser or email app. So, no, you might not
even want to climb out or dig out, but the breaking
a few holes in the walls might let a little more sunshine in. Hey Tim, just iMessage
on Android and Windows. Think about it. Just think about it. thanks to bright sellers for sponsoring thanks to bright sellers for sponsoring this video with ipad os 15 this video with ipad os 15 we're taking this versatility further we're taking this versatility further making ipad making ipad even more capable and more intuitive even more capable and more intuitive and we started right on the home screen and we started right on the home screen with widgets with widgets cool cool [Music] [Music] so wwdc keynote just ended and i think a so wwdc keynote just ended and i think a lot of us were hoping for new macbook lot of us were hoping for new macbook pros new air pods pros new air pods something to do with new hardware what something to do with new hardware what we got was a we got was a lot of software we got ios 15 lot of software we got ios 15 we got ipad os 15 we got watch os we got ipad os 15 we got watch os 8 and a bunch of software bits in 8 and a bunch of software bits in between between even though there wasn't that flagship even though there wasn't that flagship one more thing one more thing like kind of awesome hardware that i like kind of awesome hardware that i think a lot of folks were hoping for think a lot of folks were hoping for it's not to say what we got wasn't it's not to say what we got wasn't exciting exciting and i think the most interesting update and i think the most interesting update was actually the newest version of mac was actually the newest version of mac os os called monterey so let's start there so called monterey so let's start there so for me the highlight feature for me the highlight feature of mac os monterey coming later this of mac os monterey coming later this year is something called universal year is something called universal control essentially it's going to let control essentially it's going to let you use you use a single mouse and keyboard between mac a single mouse and keyboard between mac and ipad so they set it up pretty cool and ipad so they set it up pretty cool if you've got an ipad next to like your if you've got an ipad next to like your macbook pro for example macbook pro for example you can just take your mouse from the you can just take your mouse from the trackpad and without any other setup trackpad and without any other setup you can just drag it over to where your you can just drag it over to where your ipad is almost like you would have had ipad is almost like you would have had secondary display secondary display and your ipad will automatically and your ipad will automatically recognize that and give you the option recognize that and give you the option to use the trackpad to use the trackpad from your macbook pro same thing with from your macbook pro same thing with the keyboard the keyboard it also works from mac to mac as well if it also works from mac to mac as well if you have a lot of macs and you've got a you have a lot of macs and you've got a macbook pro and you've got an imac you macbook pro and you've got an imac you can can drag the mouse the other way for example drag the mouse the other way for example and use that trackpad and use that trackpad for your imac a very cool feature to for your imac a very cool feature to actually see actually see kind of takes a sidecar idea and kind of kind of takes a sidecar idea and kind of steps it up a few notches steps it up a few notches but a very awesome thing if you don't but a very awesome thing if you don't want to buy or you don't have want to buy or you don't have sort of an external mouse and keyboard sort of an external mouse and keyboard for the ipad so this next one for the ipad so this next one airplay to mac is something that makes a airplay to mac is something that makes a ton of sense and i was kind of surprised ton of sense and i was kind of surprised it wasn't there it wasn't there for a while just like you can air play for a while just like you can air play from really any device to an apple tv from really any device to an apple tv now you can airplay from whatever you now you can airplay from whatever you want whatever i device you're on want whatever i device you're on to your mac which makes a lot of sense to your mac which makes a lot of sense you can share you can share your iphone display you can airplane your iphone display you can airplane movies videos pictures whatever you want movies videos pictures whatever you want but now you can use the display but now you can use the display on your mac other highlights for example on your mac other highlights for example shortcuts for mac shortcuts for mac uh are coming a bunch of updates for uh are coming a bunch of updates for safari as well safari as well but sort of those are the key things i'm but sort of those are the key things i'm most excited about at least for mac os most excited about at least for mac os monterey monterey and of course it wouldn't be a wwdc and of course it wouldn't be a wwdc without showing the latest version of without showing the latest version of ios ios that should make its debut in september that should make its debut in september when ultimately we get the next iphone when ultimately we get the next iphone uh so they started off with a lot on uh so they started off with a lot on facetime this there weren't any sort of facetime this there weren't any sort of killer amazing features these are sort killer amazing features these are sort of small tweaks of small tweaks uh but facetime will make the calls look uh but facetime will make the calls look more natural more natural spatial audio in calls will be voice spatial audio in calls will be voice isolation so if isolation so if there's a lot of things going on in the there's a lot of things going on in the background people should be able to hear background people should be able to hear your voice a new grid view for video your voice a new grid view for video portrait mode in video which was portrait mode in video which was interesting the first time that we've interesting the first time that we've sort of sort of seen that in a facetime call i think a seen that in a facetime call i think a precursor the same portrait video make precursor the same portrait video make its way to the next iphone its way to the next iphone you can now send links to facetime calls you can now send links to facetime calls and you can actually do that and you can actually do that via the web so somebody on a pc for via the web so somebody on a pc for example example could join a facetime call that was could join a facetime call that was pretty awesome pretty awesome but i think one of the most interesting but i think one of the most interesting features and for those of us that features and for those of us that do it support for our friends and family do it support for our friends and family you can now you can now share your screen there's a new suite of share your screen there's a new suite of features they're calling share play features they're calling share play but the big one there is a screen share but the big one there is a screen share where you can share your screen with where you can share your screen with whoever you want you can also watch whoever you want you can also watch video together listen to music together video together listen to music together and that kind of thing in there as well and that kind of thing in there as well inside of messages as well inside of messages as well got a slight overhaul if you've ever got a slight overhaul if you've ever sent a lot of pictures for example sent a lot of pictures for example they're all kind of in line they're all kind of in line now they're all going to stack you can now they're all going to stack you can actually swipe through them so ios 15 is actually swipe through them so ios 15 is getting something called notification getting something called notification summary essentially it's going to summary essentially it's going to deliver all of your notifications deliver all of your notifications kind of condensed and there are a few kind of condensed and there are a few exceptions you can customize it quite a exceptions you can customize it quite a bit bit so if you have notifications from a so if you have notifications from a person for example that won't go into person for example that won't go into the summary because you might the summary because you might want to reply to them earlier but if you want to reply to them earlier but if you get a bunch of apps from get a bunch of apps from like apple news for example or things like apple news for example or things that maybe don't need attention right that maybe don't need attention right away away right away they will group into this right away they will group into this notification type of summary notification type of summary and the order by priority also in and the order by priority also in messages there's a now and do not messages there's a now and do not disturb disturb so instead of just like i'm driving you so instead of just like i'm driving you could set it for like i'm at work could set it for like i'm at work because people can know not to bother because people can know not to bother you and so speaking of that you and so speaking of that not to bother you there's a new feature not to bother you there's a new feature called focus called focus that'll be built into ios 15. they spend that'll be built into ios 15. they spend a lot of part of the keynote talking a lot of part of the keynote talking about this so essentially it'll choose about this so essentially it'll choose what you what you want to focus on a particular time and want to focus on a particular time and learn what you do learn what you do during those tasks so for example you during those tasks so for example you can dedicate a home screen can dedicate a home screen for entertainment work or just for entertainment work or just chill at home it'll meet notifications chill at home it'll meet notifications and sort of let you see apps that maybe and sort of let you see apps that maybe are focused on are focused on that particular time frame so if i've that particular time frame so if i've got a work one for example i can see got a work one for example i can see telegram and slack my news will be muted telegram and slack my news will be muted if i'm at home but i've got kind of if i'm at home but i've got kind of relaxing mode maybe netflix will show relaxing mode maybe netflix will show and all my and all my sort of work notifications will be muted sort of work notifications will be muted until i decide to exit until i decide to exit out of that alright so this is a sponsor out of that alright so this is a sponsor that i've been really looking forward to that i've been really looking forward to doing doing meet bright sellers it is a customized meet bright sellers it is a customized wine subscription service wine subscription

somebody else and somebody else doesn't get nothing we haven't seen doesn't get nothing we haven't seen before from google but it is nice to see before from google but it is nice to see it baked in it baked in uh to ios also gonna work with other uh to ios also gonna work with other sort of things like pets if you hold it sort of things like pets if you hold it at a picture of a dog for example at a picture of a dog for example uh it'll tell you what its breed is so uh it'll tell you what its breed is so your landmarks and that kind of thing your landmarks and that kind of thing a spotlight got

sort of pull actors and movies it'll all sort of pull out information giving spotlight i think out information giving spotlight i think a little bit more feature complete a little bit more feature complete so this is kind of interesting change is so this is kind of interesting change is coming to apple wallet coming to apple wallet i think i was expecting apple to offer a i think i was expecting apple to offer a crypto wallet there'd been rumors that crypto wallet there'd been rumors that was coming was coming we got though i think is equally we got though i think is equally interesting so interesting so apple is really trying to make their apple is really trying to make their vision of your wallet on your phone be vision of your wallet on your phone be able to take the place of your everyday able to take the place of your everyday wallet wallet so the big thing in states where it's so the big thing in states where it's imported be able to scan your driver's imported be able to scan your driver's license license and actually input all that information and actually input all that information and encrypt it on your phone and encrypt it on your phone so that way you can use it while you're so that way you can use it while you're traveling or if you get pulled over for traveling or if you get pulled over for example example also being able to use now the ultra also being able to use now the ultra wide band chip to wide band chip to unlock hotel rooms more uses for cars unlock hotel rooms more uses for cars you have to take it out of your pocket you have to take it out of your pocket it'll just know when you get close it's it'll just know when you get close it's making the the wallet app again making the the wallet app again closer to not ever having to carry a closer to not ever having to carry a physical wallet weather got an update physical wallet weather got an update too essentially they just too essentially they just took what they did from dark sky and put took what they did from dark sky and put into the weather app which into the weather app which no surprise but nice to see it's going no surprise but nice to see it's going to change based on condition new to change based on condition new graphics for stats and graphics for stats and all that kind of stuff uh maps got all that kind of stuff uh maps got an update sort of making it more an update sort of making it more interactive uh show you elevation interactive uh show you elevation road labels and colors new night mode road labels and colors new night mode better graphics for navigation better graphics for navigation all that kind of stuff will be coming all that kind of stuff will be coming later on this year later on this year all right so uh ios wasn't the only all right so uh ios wasn't the only thing i got updated as i insinuate at thing i got updated as i insinuate at the beginning of this video the beginning of this video ipad os 15 came and the big feature ipad os 15 came and the big feature uh was widgets that you can now uh was widgets that you can now place anywhere like you could on your place anywhere like you could on your iphone iphone that's essentially it it's nice and it's that's essentially it it's nice and it's there there um there are larger formats that'll work um there are larger formats that'll work with ipad so that's nice other kind of with ipad so that's nice other kind of iphone features there's an app library iphone features there's an app library now built you can access it from the now built you can access it from the dock you can also now hide pages dock you can also now hide pages if you want but one of the coolest if you want but one of the coolest things is new multitasking things is new multitasking so there's a new menu on top it'll give so there's a new menu on top it'll give you things like full screen and split you things like full screen and split view view quick access to other apps swipe down to quick access to other apps swipe down to choose another app choose another app open app center on the screen and a new open app center on the screen and a new minimizing minimizing it's kind of a window called a shelf but it's kind of a window called a shelf but kind of like what you do with the dock kind of like what you do with the dock in mac os you can kind of minimize in mac os you can kind of minimize things you can see all of your apps that things you can see all of your apps that are minimized are minimized and then call them back up other cool and then call them back up other cool things you can do you can create split things you can do you can create split view and a new app switcher view and a new app switcher there are changes to the keyboards notes there are changes to the keyboards notes and things like that and things like that but smaller features nothing i don't but smaller features nothing i don't think anything giant or sort of flagship think anything giant or sort of flagship uh an ipad os 15 like we were expecting uh an ipad os 15 like we were expecting but certainly a small improvement but certainly a small improvement to ipad os 14. uh we didn't get i think to ipad os 14. uh we didn't get i think this is a big story here this is a big story here uh we didn't really get pro app i think uh we didn't really get pro app i think a lot of people were expected there's an a lot of people were expected there's an update to swift though where you can update to swift though where you can create iphone and ipad apps now directly create iphone and ipad apps now directly on your ipad so on your ipad so that was cool um but nothing to really that was cool um but nothing to really take advantage of that new m1 chip like take advantage of that new m1 chip like i think a lot of people i think a lot of people were hoping for like final cut pro were hoping for like final cut pro making its way to the ipad making its way to the ipad i guess that goes to show you never buy i guess that goes to show you never buy hardware hardware based on future software because you based on future software because you never know never know what's going to come another kind of the what's going to come another kind of the last new feature was quick notes you can last new feature was quick notes you can kind of swipe up from the corner a new kind of swipe up from the corner a new note's going to appear note's going to appear if you have the apple pencil you can jot if you have the apple pencil you can jot it down or type something really quickly it down or type something really quickly there were other things that got updated there were other things that got updated after spend too much time talking about after spend too much time talking about it but updates to icloud it but updates to icloud uh apple kind of getting into vpn on the uh apple kind of getting into vpn on the name of privacy name of privacy some updates to health and of course we some updates to health and of course we saw updates to watch os saw updates to watch os now watch os 8 which brings things like now watch os 8 which brings things like new portrait watch faces new portrait watch faces improvements to health nothing giant improvements to health nothing giant there there's no there there's no new customizable watch faces or a watch new customizable watch faces or a watch face store it's just face store it's just small step improvements like we saw to small step improvements like we saw to the iphone the ipad the iphone the ipad also on the watch so that's that's it also on the watch so that's that's it huge software changes huge software changes nothing on the hardware side i'm curious nothing on the hardware side i'm curious if you guys are excited disappointed how if you guys are excited disappointed how you guys fall on it you guys fall on it i think the improvements to privacy are i think the improvements to privacy are really nice being able to use sort of really nice being able to use sort of the track pad from a laptop the track pad from a laptop on your ipad is awesome and sort of on your ipad is awesome and sort of making things slowly better making things slowly better are always nice but nothing giant this are always nice but nothing giant this year and apple maybe is held to a higher year and apple maybe is held to a higher standard standard when it comes to their keynotes you when it comes to their keynotes you always expect these awesome things always expect these awesome things and we didn't get them so we still have and we didn't get them so we still have a lot to look forward to i guess this a lot to look forward to i guess this year year like new macbook pros new mac mini maybe like new macbook pros new mac mini maybe a mac pro and maybe an imac pro a mac pro and maybe an imac pro perhaps we'll see all those show up in perhaps we'll see all those show up in the future at dedicated hardware event the future at dedicated hardware event but this year that was not wwdc but this year that was not wwdc Apple has been making earbuds for two decades,
but they’ve only ever offered them in one color: white. So why is Apple willing to make colorful iPhones
and iMacs, but not colorful earbuds? Well that’s what I’ll explain right now. Design and brand identity is extremely important
to Apple. They want their products to look unique and
be easily identifiable in public. That’s part of the reason why Apple’s
notebooks used to feature illuminated logos. But when it came to the iPod in 2001 they
ran into a unique problem. Since it was a small mobile device that would
be hidden in people’s pockets, instead of being prominently displayed like computers. So how would Apple incorporate a strong brand
identity with the iPod if it would hardly ever been seen in public? Well, they focused on part of the product
that would be visible: it’s headphones. But earbuds were too small to feature something
like an Apple logo, so they focused on any headphones most defining feature: their color. At the time, virtually every pair of headphones
included with CD players and Walkmans were black. So to stand out, Apple went the other direction. Making their headphones pure white, which
matched the iPod. Apple even highlighted this design choice
with their iconic silhouette ad campaign that featured the white headphones perhaps even
more than the iPod itself. The product went on to become the best-selling
music player in the word, and it’s white headphones became synonymous with the brand. But in 2004, Apple had another decision to
make, when they began offering the iPod in different colors. Some customers expected them to create colorful
headphones to match. But instead, Apple continued to include white
headphones that made their music player instantly recognizable. And this approach continues today. Despite the iPod touch being offered in a
variety of colors, they all include white EarPods. Despite two generations of AirPods, plus an
additional AirPods Pro model, Apple continues to offer those in just one color: white. But with the release of AirPods Max and the
iMac, I think there’s reason to believe Apple is finally changing their tune. Their first over-ear headphone called AirPods
Max is available in five colors, and the iMac is available in seven. But what’s even more important is the approach
Apple took to the iMac’s accessories. For the first time ever, they included color-matched
cables. An approach that could be carried through
to the next EarPods model, and to Apple’s entire AirPods line. So after two decades of waiting, we may finally
get colorful earbuds from Apple in the near future. This is Greg with Apple Explained, thanks
for watching till the end, and I’ll see you in the next video. Do you hear that? What’s going on? That’s a good question. There’s got to be an explanation. Know we oughtta do? Yes, sir. You wanted to make history, so maybe this is your chance. There are things that you can feel and not describe. Over the course of a law-man’s life, he comes to understand
why he was chosen. Owwww Where are you taking me? A new world. Hi, fellas. I’ll go in three… Two… One. Launch! Oh my God, it’s so great, isn’t it? It is gorgeous up there! TELL ME! Oh no, it’s a song. This is my Beach Boys song. Wouldn’t it be nice? Boom! You’re the girl with the deaf family, and you sing? Here they come. You’re it for me. I feel the same way. When she sleeps, she turns into a wolf. I’m begging you to come back to me. The world deserves to see this. I do believe you have just had a breakthrough. We fight for freedom. Only we can shorten the darkness. Hey, it’s a story. We’ve been working really well together. This is unbelievable! So, what do you do? I teach fifth grade. Shut up, I love you. I think we’ve all had enough of this amuse-bouche. Time to move onto the main course. Dear Tim. Hello, Mr. Cook. I know you may never read this, but I just wanted
to put it out there -- I live in Massachusetts. I'm a country boy
from small-town Mississippi. I'm a two-time Olympian. I'm the father
of a nine-year-old. I am a 99-year-old
world traveler. Every day for the last
two-and-a-half years, I have worn this tiny computer
on my wrist. This is the first time
I've worn a watch since my bar mitzvah. I was a scrawny,
sports-hating kid who never really liked
being active. I was coming back
from a knee surgery. While I was never fat, I was the proud owner
of a dad bod. I fell into a deep depression, and weighed 250 pounds. Now I get up at five a.m. If it's five minutes
to midnight, I'll do pushups
in my bedroom. I'll take the dog out for a really quick walk
around the block. I walk around the house and my family thinks
I'm a little crazy. I dutifully oblige when the Apple Watch reminds me
to stand up every hour. [PHONE RINGS] I ran my first
Spartan Race in December, and ran a full marathon
in February. Dear Mr. Cook, our daughter was recently
diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. My car rolled over
three times, and my phone landed
far out of my reach. Once I collected my thoughts, I remember my Apple Watch
had the SOS feature. After being rushed
to the emergency room, I was diagnosed with a condition that was causing my liver,
kidneys, and heart to start shutting down. The integration
of her glucose monitor with the Apple Watch
lets us make sure her blood sugars don't
go to dangerously low levels. For six minutes,
I hung there in my car talking to a dispatcher
until help arrived. Had I not been wearing
my Apple Watch, I never would have sought
medical attention, which in turn, saved my life. Sincerely, Paul. Thank you so much
for creating something that does not make me feel old. Thanks for listening. Avi. Sincerely, Stewart. All the best, Kara. Sincerely, Arthur. Jill. Casey. Ready for your day three recap?

beyond passwords with iCloud Keychain
and Passkeys. - This is the first step
of a multiyear effort in replacing passwords. - Phew.
I'm gonna feel so secure. And we learned how you can
create interactive, memorable experiences
to onboard people into your app. And there's so much more
amazing stuff on the way. ♪ ♪ [LAUGHTER] Wow, that was a trip! ♪ oh no if you're feeling better cow guy people glad no shot good morning and welcome to wwdc our new release is ios 15. it's packed with

web facetime calls are still end and encrypted so your privacy is never compromised we love enjoying shared experiences and so we built share play with share play you can bring that album right into the conversation when you're on a call all you need to do is press play in apple music and you can choose to listen together and like magic that's kind of cool music playback will start in sync for everyone on the call and you're still connected with facetime while listening when you're on a facetime call and boom you and your friends are watching the same video totally in sync share play is designed to work with your other favorite apps and streaming services and today we're so pleased to announce that we're already working with some incredible partners watch blockbuster movies with your friends on disney plus and hit tv shows on hulu catch originals from hbo max and see your friends react live to a buzzer beater in the nba app let's get started with a feature we call live super taco says it you don't give credit to actual innovation in apple make fun of bad parts you set society back okay they're not innovating anything they're not innovating all this is like a glorified zoom asshat what are you on about a text let's say i just finished a meeting with the team and i want to capture my notes from the whiteboard i can now just point the camera at the whiteboard and an indicator appears here in the lower right when i tap it the text just jumps right out i can use my normal text selection gestures just drag and copy now i can switch over to mail and paste those in and then send this off to tim how cool is that and this is great for photos already in your photos and it understands seven languages including simplified and traditional chinese and works across iphone ipad and mac with the apple wallet app we set out to replace your physical wallet with ios 15 we're bringing keys for your everyday places to wallet starting with where you live once you're creating the fastest most secure way to unlock your house apartment or flat and where you work just add your corporate badge and tap to enter your building or office however fully free of your physical wallet there's one more thing we need to bring to iphone and that's your id so we're bringing identity cards to apple wallet this fall you'll just scan your driver's license or state id in participating u.s states it's that easy your id information is now in wallet encrypted and safely stored in the secure element the same hardware technology i think i think i'm confident and secure and the tsa is working to enable airport security checkpoints as the first place you can use your digital id when you present your id you'll know what specific information is requested and securely presented with just a tab you're off to your flight our goal has always been to build the world's best map but in ios 15 maps will offer incredible new details for commercial districts marinas buildings and so much more we've added things like elevation new road colors and labels as well as hundreds of custom designed landmarks for places like coit tower and the golden gate bridge oh mapper and we built a beautiful new nighttime mode with a moonlit glow and when driving on highways maps now renders overlapping complex interchanges in three-dimensional space making it much easier to see upcoming traffic conditions or to know which lane you need to be in and of course we'll be able to grab this explosion experience to car play later this year and if you've ever exited a station unsure of which direction you need to go maps will help get you back on track simply hold up your iphone scan the buildings in the area and maps will generate a highly accurate position delivering detailed directions augmented reality to help you complete your journey okay with their annual vision quest postponed our merry band of nomadic neighbors wandered aimlessly through the california hills before donning their technicolored wetsuits and immersing themselves in the inspiration of the beautiful rich waters of monterey mac os monterey gives you the power to accomplish more than ever and helps you work fluidly across all of your devices the incredible features we talked about earlier are going to be great for the ways you work on mac like the new capabilities in facetime which help you look and sound your best while talking to co-workers or friends with share play it's just to wear plain to watch movies and shows together on your stunning mac display or share an app window as you collaborate on a project shared with you offers a totally new way to discover photos articles and more that people share with you over messages right in your mouth this year we've created a completely new way to work across your devices with greater precision and speed and we call it universal control i'm putting the finishing touches on an illustration here oh no it's the last piece i need to finish that this is their uh this is their engineering booth or whatever dude if they use complicated words right they always go to this weird ass lab but they're just it's just weird like what even is this place like what is this place dude it's like they're engineering or everything i don't even know it's always the first piece i need to finish a presentation that i have open like like what did i check my macbook now i'll just set my ipad down next to my mac and check this out without any other setup i'm gonna simply move my mac cursor towards my ipad and the ipad automatically recognizes it and if i move a bit further boom oh that the cursor is now on the ipad how cool is that going universal control works with more than two devices so let's add this oh no into the mix now i can use the track pad on my map what what what what if it goes past on your phone in your pocket now you did where the is my curse dude where's the curse at did you have to look for i don't get it to control my imac as well i can also switch to use my imax keyboard that's a hot thank you and this is so cool watch this now i have a title text image i've been working on here in procreate on my ipad now i'm going to take this image and drag it across all three devices oh god and drop it in to final cut just like that we think using the browser should feel natural and uncluttered so we've reimagined the browsing experience we distilled the toolbar to its essential elements tabs are more compact modern and lightweight and there's a completely new way to use tabs with tab groups they allow you to easily save and manage your tabs without cluttering up your tab bar oh my god let's start with safari's gorgeous new tab design all of my tabs are right here in the news i'm gonna use the party today one of the really cool things that we did this year is we built the search field right into the active tab safari is more space efficient than ever and i can see more of the page i can click on the active tab to see the page's full address chat i know what it is then i can search right now maybe this is because of school when i was younger and then i thinking of safari i didn't think of the loading symbol i remember when i was in school with these little macintoshes you would click safari and it would just start  lagging reader is in the town i remember these things these computers is right here in the more menu check this out as i switch tabs the tab bar takes on the color of the site that i'm viewing so it's spinning a wheel of doom it looks beautiful tab groups are an easy and lightweight way to save your tabs and pick them back up later i'll open the new redesigned sidebar and i have a few tab groups here already each of these groups is a whole set of tabs okay use them for meal planning for news and for gift shopping that's annoying with ios 15 we have some great new features coming to airpods starting with conversation boost which is designed to help people with mild hearing challenges stay more connected in conversations okay through computational audio and beamforming microphones conversation boost focuses your airpods pro on the person talking in front of you making it easier to hear and follow along in a face-to-face conversation and to help you hear the conversation even better you can also reduce the amount of ambient noise next we have significantly improved how airpods work in find my with ios 15 you can locate your airpods pro and airpods max using the find my network no do airpods simply send out a secure bluetooth beacon that can be detected by other apple devices they can relay your airpods location to the network and then back to your find my app nearby just choose play sound listen for the chirp whether they're in their case or out the new proximity view in the find my app lets you know when you're getting close to make it even less likely to lose your airpods you can now receive a separation alert to notify you if you leave your airpods behind with guys how to how about wires and just just earbuds taking this making ipad even more capable and more intuitive and we started right on the home screen with widgets they offer beautiful glanceable information at just the right moments and this year we have a big date now you can place widgets among the apps on your home screen here i am on the home screen you can see that i already have a few widgets placed along the top oh let's start by adding a widget i'll bring up the widget gallery here you'll notice some new widgets like the beautiful new find my widget and the contacts widget which helps you reach family and friends with just a tap did it this is the thing i was thinking towards the top here now of course a bigger canvas means more room for widgets so we're adding a new larger this is as it on the crack are you kidding me for ipad's larger display here's the new apple tv widget i can easily dive into my favorite shows with a tab and here's my gaming page and we brought the same ease of multitasking to apps with multiple windows so you know in mail i can touch and hold on this message to open it centered on my screen but i want to save this email and come back to it later okay so i can just swipe down to minimize it into a new area we're calling the shelf the shelf gives me easy access to all open windows of an app oh my god safari and you'll see that the shelf appears automatically when i switch apps i often have a lot of safari windows open many in split view paired with other apps and now i can just tap to quickly switch between them oh my god i can also add or remove windows right here from the shelf we've made the app switcher even more powerful that's like and now create a split view just by dragging one app over another well that that was pretty good okay then you're so cringe dude guys you guys what is with this guy man guys guys what is banam says the wireless mouse user what is wrong with that don't be a sheet that hates everything apple has to offer your brain is slush your brain is slush boy safari is the fastest browser broke boys coping useless copage and enjoy your new apple device man also enjoy your new apple tv guys don't dumb at the standard don't tell them guys don't tell them [Music] give me [ Typing Sounds ] [ Music ] [ Cheers and Applause ] >> Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Thank you so much
for joining us. Welcome to our Town Hall on
the Infinite Loop Campus. Normally, we don't spend
a lot of time looking back but yes we are about to
celebrate Apple's 40th birthday on April 1st. [ Applause ] That video lists some
of the amazing products and epic moments in our history and reminds us just how
many times Apple has changed the world. Recently, we passed
a major milestone that no one could've
ever imagined. There are now more than
1 billion Apple devices in use around the world. [ Applause ] This is an incredible milestone
for us and an indicator of how much impact Apple has
on people around the world. Our products are such
an important part of people's daily lives. And with that, comes a
significant responsibility. So before we get started today,
I'd like to address something that I know is on the minds
of many people this morning. We built the iPhone
for you, our customers, and we know that it is a
deeply personal device. For many of us, the iPhone
is an extension of ourselves. About a month ago, we asked
Americans across the country to join in a conversation. We need to decide as a nation
how much power the government should have over our data
and over our privacy. I've been humbled and deeply
grateful for the outpouring of support that we've
received from Americans across the country
from all walks of life. We did not expect to be
in this position at odds with our own government,
but we believe strongly that we have a responsibility
to help you protect your data and protect your privacy. We owe it to our customers
and we owe it to our country. This is an issue that
impacts all of us, and we will not shrink
from this responsibility. [ Applause ] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. OK. So let's get back to why
you're here this morning. Because so many people use
our products every day, we understand that we have an
opportunity and a responsibility to impact things for the better. So we want to get started
this morning by talking about two initiatives
where we are working hard to leave the world
better than we found it. We'd like to start with
the environment and I'd like to invite Lisa Jackson up
to tell you what we're doing to preserve and protect
the environment. Lisa. [ Applause ] >> Thank you. Thanks so much. Well, you know, just like
everything we do at Apple, when we think about
the environment, we think about innovation. You see, we want to change
the world for the better and we think there's no
greater challenge in the world than our changing climate. Now, the solution is energy
efficiency and renewable energy, and the time for
action is right now. So two years ago, we told
you about our ambitious goal, one that we hope
others will adopt. We told you that our goal was
to be 100% renewable in 100% of our operations worldwide. That's all of our offices,
all of our retail stores and every single one
of our data centers. So two years later,
how are we doing? Well, currently, 93% of our facilities worldwide
run on renewable energy. [ Applause ] And just last year,
we reached our goal of using 100% renewable
power to power our operations in the United States, as well as
our offices and stores in China. In fact, we're now
a 100% renewable in 23 countries around
the world. Now, in some places we're able to purchase renewable
energy right from the grid, from existing sources, but
that's not always possible, which has led us to some
pretty innovative solutions. In Sichuan Province,
China, we found a way to build a 40-megawatt
solar farm without disturbing
the local population. Yeah. [ Applause ] The innovation is in
building a system that allows for electricity generation
and hay production for the local yak ranchers. That solar project is producing
more than enough electricity to power our 34 retail stores and our 19 offices
in the country. That makes our facilities
there carbon-neutral. In Singapore where there's not
enough room to put solar panels on the ground, we looked up. Solar arrays on more than
800 rooftops will cover the electricity use of our
offices and our future stores. We're really proud to be a
100% renewable in Singapore. We're also really proud
of the fact that 100% of our data centers are powered
by clean sources of energy like the sun, wind and water. Now, think for a second
about what that means. It means every time
you send an iMessage or make a FaceTime video
call or ask Siri a question, you can feel really good about reducing your
impact on the environment. Now, let's talk about
another way that we're reducing our impact
on the environment and that's by protecting forests that produce the paper we use
especially for our packaging. You see, we believe that paper like energy can be a
renewable resource. So we're proud to announce that
today 99% of our packaging comes from paper that is
recycled or is coming from sustainably
managed forests. [ Applause ] This is especially important
as we continue our move to all paper packaging but
we're not stopping there. Through our partnership
with The Conversation Fund, we've permanently preserved over
36,000 acres of working forests in Maine, in North Carolina
and we're partnering with World Wildlife Fund to
improve the management of up to 1 million acres in China. You see, our goal is to
add to the world's supply of responsibly sourced paper
rather than take from it. Now, while we're focused on
conservation, let me tell you about another way we're working to preserve our planet's
resources, and that's through
reuse and recycling. You see, we worked really hard to make sure our products don't
end up in places like this, and we think the best way to do
that is to have them be reused. That's why we design
our products to last, and we're happy to say that
thanks to their durability, the vast majority of
iPhones that we get back end up being reused, including
the phones we get back from our iPhone upgrade
and trade up programs. But at some point, even our
products need to be recycled. Many recycling systems
today waste much of the materials they
collect, so it can't be reused. We think it's time
for a new approach. We put an incredible
amount of energy into designing the best
products in the world and we put that same kind of energy into
thinking about what happens when they can no longer be used. Let me introduce you to a
pretty cool R&D project, we call him Liam. >> The iPhone is the result
of years of innovation but true innovation means
considering what happens to a product at every
stage of its life cycle. Meet Liam. When it's time, Liam
deconstructs your iPhone. Parts are detected and
removed and separated, so the materials inside those
parts can be repurposed. To rescue cobalt and
lithium from the battery, separate the gold and copper
in the camera, extract silver and platinum from the main
logic board, so the materials in your iPhone can live on. Because in a world
with limited resources, some things can't be replaced. [ Music ] [ Applause ] >> He is pretty cool, right? There's no other
machine in the world that can do what Liam can
do, and it was conceived and designed by Apple engineers
right here in California. The things we've learned from this project will help
us make even bigger strides in the area of reuse and
recycling as we go forward. As you saw on the video, Liam separates the iPhone
into its components. This allows us to
recover the materials, high quality materials,
and reintroduce them into the global supply, and
that saves natural resources. So that tungsten from the
iPhone alert module can be used to make a precision
cutting tool, and the silver from the motherboard can be
used to, in a solar panel. Now, ultimately, our goal
is to create breakthroughs that allow us to use those
high quality materials in our own products because
reuse and recycling is so important, and that's
where you can come in. With Apple Renew, you can
recycle your devices easily and quickly in a way
that's safe for your data and safe for the planet. All you have to do is take
them into an Apple retail store or send them to us for free by
visiting apple.com/recycling to print a prepaid
mailing label. We're making great progress
in our environmental efforts but we have a lot more
to do and we promise to keep you updated
along the way. Now back to Tim. Thanks. [ Cheering and Applause ] >> Thank you, Lisa. [ Applause ] Powering Apple on a
100% renewable energy, it is an incredible,
ambitious and bold objective but we are determined to meet it
and we hope others will join us. The second initiative
we'd like to talk about this morning is health. With the launch of
ResearchKit last year, we've seen that Apple technology
can have a positive impact on people's health. And to tell us about some
progress in this area, I'd like to invite
Jeff Williams. Jeff. [ Applause ] >> Last year, we introduced
ResearchKit and our goal was to use technology to solve some of the biggest problems
facing medical research. We wanted to make
it easier for people to participate and
research studies. And we wanted to make it
easier to gather accurate and frequent data from the
devices we're all already carrying in our hands. So what happened? Virtually overnight,
the research studies that we launched became some of
the largest in history with tens of thousands of people
signing up. Like in this Parkinson's study which became the largest
Parkinson's study in history in less than 24 hours. [ Applause ] Studies broke geographical
boundaries. Traditionally, studies
are centered around the research institution
but with ResearchKit, anyone, anywhere can participate. Mount Sinai's Asthma app
actually discovered asthma triggers from all 50 states. But more important
than any of that, researchers are gaining insights that just weren't
possible before. Take diabetes. You and I know diabetes
as type 1 and type 2 but Mass General's study
of type 2 diabetes found that some people respond
completely differently to therapies than others,
supporting the theory that there are actually
subtypes of type 2 diabetes, helping pave the way for precision medicine
for the future. Some of the world's most
respected institutions have released ResearchKit
studies covering a wide range of diseases and conditions
that affect billions of people around the world. ResearchKit is opening up all
kind of possibilities and I'd like to you show a video
to tell you more about it. >> ResearchKit was
created with the goal of improving medical research. A year later, we're seeing
app developers, doctors, and even patients
take these ideas and make them more powerful
than we could have ever dreamed. >> We can detect autism
as early as 18 months old but the median age that a
child in US is diagnosed with autism is five years old, so we need a radical
new solution. >> If autism is diagnosed early, it can have significant
benefits for the child. The point of Autism and Beyond
is to help engage parents in a ResearchKit study
but more importantly is to eventually develop a tool
that they can use at home with their child to
screen for autism. >> We show the child videos and
we use the front-facing camera to record the child's
reaction to these videos, and then we have algorithms
that then can tell us about the child's emotions
and other behaviors. So we have a chance to
understand child development in a completely new way. >> When you have large
numbers of people participating in a research, their insights into the condition
increase exponentially. With ResearchKit, we're
getting day by day assessments on how people are doing. >> Parkinson's, it's a
disease that slows you down and exercise will
make your feel better, that's what I've come to learn. What I'm trying to do lately is to use the app before I
exercise, and then afterward to see how exercise might
forestall progression of it because it's not curable at the
moment, at the moment [laughs]. >> Now with mPower app,
we're getting information that can be used to personalize
the care that patients receive. >> If we could bring
research and care together and really bridge that gap, we can help people live
healthier and happier lives. >> I had my first
epileptic seizure when I was three in a half. I always have that fear first
of all in the back of my mind. Am I going to have a
seizure while I'm driving? What if I'm at work
or I'm by myself? How am I going to
handle that situation? >> The EpiWatch app is
the first research app to use the Apple Watch. So those sensors can be used to collect physiologic data
during seizures and we're using that data to try to
develop a seizure detector. >> The research that they
are doing is exciting because they're trying
to find a predictor. Having that would be amazing
because I would know, hey, this is going to happen. You have plenty of
time to get to safety. It's like, OK, I got this. >> This is no longer
just about research. People are using apps to learn
about themselves in a way that they couldn't before
to create a better life for themselves in terms
of their own health. >> ResearchKit has clearly
transformed research. More importantly, it laid the
foundation to transform care. >> What's really amazing about an iPhone is you
have it in your pocket. You don't need any
special equipment. Here is the phone. We can do this science. We can do this medicine
with a phone. [ Music ] [ Applause ] >> You know, when we introduced
ResearchKit, our goal was simply to improve medical research, and we thought our
work was largely done. But what you probably saw in
the film and what became clear to us later is the
very same tools we used to advance medical
research can also be used to help people with their care. Let me give you an example. In the Parkinson's study,
patients do a test several times with their iPhone like that
simple tap test you saw on the video to assess
their symptom levels. And researchers can
see the symptom level across a range of days. And they can see this
before and after medication. And there were lots of
patients like patients A where you can see that symptom
levels improve post medication. In other words, the
medicine is working. But there were also a lot
of patients like patient B where post medication,
there's no improvement at all. Their symptom levels
didn't change. In other words, the
medicine is not working. The patient either
needs a different dose or a different medication or
maybe no medication at all, but today neither the individual
nor the caregiver has this information, and we think
empowering people with data about their health is
incredibly important. So today we're launching
CareKit. [ Applause ] CareKit is a framework to
build apps that empower people to take a more active
role in their care, and the very first CareKit
app being released today is for Parkinson's. And it surfaces some of
that valuable information we discussed, so people can start
understanding better what affects their health. And these six leading
institutions will begin using this app with their Parkinson's
patients immediately, so they can have a more
informed discussion about individualized treatments. Let me give you another example. Surgery. One of the things
physicians tell us is one of the most important
things affecting outcome of surgery is actually what you
do during the recovery process. Yet, we go from being
monitored by a team of highly trained specialist
using leading edge technology to being discharged with
this, a single sheet of paper. This is actually what happens
pretty much across the country. This is your list of things
to do, things not to do, which days you're
supposed to do them on. And adherence to this is
notoriously very poor. So, using the CareKit
modules, we've been working with Texas Medical Center
and they've created an app for the phone that got you
through this critical process in a completely different way. It's got a care card which
is your list of things to do every day in checklist
form, and as you fill them out, the little heart fills
up, it's really nice. It's got a symptom and
measurement tracker where you can record
information on your progress. It's, you can record things
like your temperature to monitor for an infection or you can use
the accelerometer on the iPhone to study the range of motion. And then you can share this
information with your loved ones who can help support you
through this recovery process. And best of all, you can
share this information with your physician who
will take the results of how you're doing and they
will dynamically update your care plan, so it changes on the
fly, something just not possible with a sheet of paper. Those are just two
examples of CareKit apps. There are others coming and we think the possibilities
here are limitless. Now, a word about privacy,
nothing is more sensitive than your health data. You decide which apps you use and with whom you
share this information. CareKit like ResearchKit
will be open source and it will be available
in April. We have been absolutely humbled
and inspired by the response to ResearchKit and we can't wait to see what great apps
get created with CareKit. Thank you. Back to Tim. [ Applause ] >> Thank you. It's amazing that in such
a short period of time that ResearchKit has
had a profound impact on the broad area of medical
research, and our hope is that CareKit can have
the same kind of impact on helping individuals
manage their care. So you've seen the latest
important work we have going on the environment and
in the health area, now I'd like to talk
about products and I'll get started
with the Apple Watch. Since we launched it
less than a year ago, the Apple Watch has become
the top selling smart watch in the world. But most importantly to
us, customers love it. They found that it's
not just useful but it's become an essential
part of their daily lives. They love being able to receive
and respond to messages directly from the wrist, as well
as track their activity, manage their calendar,
navigate with maps, and get up-to-the-minute
information on sports scores and news headlines and more. People also love
changing the bands and how it gives the watch
an entirely new look, one that's appropriate for any
purpose or occasion or season. About a third of our Apple
Watch wearers regularly change their bands. Today, we're introducing
some brand new colors and a new band that's made from
a whole different material. Our new woven nylon band. Thank you. [ Applause and Cheering ] Our new woven nylon
band features a unique four-layer construction. It comes in a variety
of vibrant colors. We think it's going to
be incredibly popular. Also, there's new sport and
leather bands in all new colors, and there's a stunning
Space Black Milanese loop that is absolutely beautiful. [ Applause ] We're really excited about
this new spring line up and we want even more people
to be able to enjoy Apple Watch and what it can do for them. So beginning today, Apple
Watch will start at just 299. [ Applause and Cheering ] That's our update
on Apple Watch. Now, I'd like to
talk about Apple TV, bringing all new capabilities to the biggest screen
in your house. People are absolutely loving the
new Apple TV with the App Store and the innovative Siri Remote. After the introduction of the
new Apple TV last quarter, we had the largest
sales ever for Apple TV. Now, apps are the
future of television and this transition
is well under way. In just a short period of time since the Apple TV
has been shipping, we have 5,000 apps
on the App Store. There's amazing content apps
to enjoy all over the world. Like this one from HBO, HBO Now, where you can watch the latest
HBO shows whenever you want, wherever you want. Shows like "Game of
Thrones" and "Veep" and of course "Silicon Valley". And NCAA March Madness
Live just in time, where you can watch two live
tournament games simultaneously, this is exclusive to Apple TV, and you can also monitor the
scores of the other games and quickly change
between the action. And of course, there's a
whole bunch of games to pick from like this one
from AG Drive. Now, in addition to great
video content and great games, there's a wide variety of
other apps on the App Store. Like Solar Walk 2, which
turns your living room into a planetarium, and BrainPOP
which is a great educational app for kids, and GrubHub which you
can order your favorite food and get it delivered
right to your home. This is very key for me. And Cody, you can choose from
the internet's best workouts, there's some great ones. This is just a small sample of
what's available in Apple TV and much more is coming. Now, of course, tvOS
powers the Apple TV. And at the heart of the
Apple TV experience is Siri. With Siri, you can just ask
for something great to watch. Like show me movies
with Kevin Hart. And there it is. Pick your favorite. In looking for a
movie or a TV show, Siri searches the popular
apps so you don't have to. We've added some great
contents app for Siri to search, we've got more coming, and we'll
keep adding more over time. Now, we've got some other
great features coming to Apple TV like folders. Now, you can organize your apps in your home screen
just like you want to. [ Applause and Cheering ] And dictation. So you can now use your voice
to enter text on the screen. This includes usernames
and passwords. You're really going to love it. [ Applause ] Plus Siri for the App Store. So you can ask for
any app that you want or any type of app
that you want. And now, you can access your
entire iCloud Photo Library including live photos
right on your big screen. All of this is available. It's a free update
beginning today. That's Apple TV. [ Applause ] Now, I'd like to
talk about iPhone. iPhone is the most loved
smart phone in the world. And today, we're welcoming a
new member to the iPhone family. And to tell you all about it, I'd like to invite
up Greg Joswiak. Greg? [ Applause ] >> Thanks, Tim. Our customers are loving the
new iPhone 6s and 6s Plus and while the vast majority of our customers prefer
this larger display iPhones, we're here today to talk
about a smaller iPhone. Our four-inch iPhones are
actually an important part of our lineup. Just last year we sold over
30 million four-inch iPhones, that's a lot of phones,
put it in perspective, it took us about two and a half
years to sell that many iPhones when we first started
from our entire lineup. So why are people
buying four-inch iPhones? Well, there's two reasons. First, for some people they
simply love smaller phones. They want the most
compact iPhone design. Second, we found that for
a lot of these customers, it's their first iPhone. Whether they're switching
from Android or it's their first smart phone, it's the first time
they're experiencing iOS and our hardware and
software integration and our amazing ecosystem. And in some countries like
China, it's the majority of these customers who it's
their very first iPhone. So some people asked us,
some people even pleaded us to please keep the four-inch
products in our lineup. Well, today we're going to
do just that and we're going to make it a whole lot better. And as you may have heard,
we're calling it the iPhone SE. [ Applause ] So let me show it to you. So we start with this
beloved aluminum design but we've made some beautiful
refinements including this gorgeous rose gold finish. We've added matte-chamfered
edges and an inset stainless
steel Apple logo just like the iPhone 6s
but it's on the inside where the iPhone
SE really shines. It's got advanced technologies that make this the most
powerful four-inch phone ever. It's incredibly powerful
which makes it even better to do the things that
iPhone customers want to do including playing the
most graphic intensive games. So at the heart of the iPhone
SE of course is our chips, our amazing Apple A9 chip with its embedded M9
motion coprocessor. This means that the iPhone
SE has the same processing performance as the iPhone 6s which is literally double
the speed of the iPhone 5s. And the iPhone SE also has
the same incredible graphics performance as the iPhone 6s which is three times
faster than the iPhone 5s. And the embedded M9 motion
coprocessor is always on, so it enables all
kinds of features like tracking your
fitness all day but it allows you
to use "hey Siri". So hands free, you
get to say things like this just -- "Hey, Siri. How do you feel about
recycling?" >> I love the Apple
Renew program but Liam really tears me apart. [ Laughter ] >> That's for Lisa. So even though it has all
these new capabilities and it's so much more powerful
than the iPhone 5s, the iPhone SE delivers
incredible battery improvements across the board. And of course people love taking
photos with their iPhones more than any other phone or camera. So we wanted to give it our
most advanced camera system. So we've given it our incredible
12-megapixel iSight camera with Focus Pixels
and True Tone flash. And we have of course that image
signal processor from the A9 that enables all kinds
of great features like the panorama pictures
up to 63 megapixels but also improvements to
video, slo-mo, time-lapse and of course your photos, which means you can incredible
pictures like this and this. I don't know what
you're thinking but that is not Phil Schiller
skateboarding to work. He looks just like him though. And yeah, and the iPhone
SE can capture live photos. So you can take your
still photos and have them come to life. [ Applause ] And our front-facing
FaceTime HD camera, we'd given the Retina Flash. What that means is if you want
to take a selfie in low light, we're able to drive the display
three times brighter than normal in order to flash the True Tone
flash, so you get a picture like this instead
of the dark selfie. It can even capture 4K video
and just like the iPhone 6s, you can edit up to two
simultaneous streams of 4K video with iMovie right
on the iPhone SE. We've also given it great
wireless capabilities. We now have LTE speeds that are
50% faster than the iPhone 5s and we've added more LTE bands so you have better
global roaming and of course high fidelity call
quality with voice over LTE. And we've given it high
speed WiFi as well 802.11ac, which is three times
faster than the iPhone 5s and high quality WiFi
calling is also supported. Now, it has Touch ID to keep the
contents of your iPhone secure but also quickly
available to you with just a touch
of your finger. And now, you can make easy,
secure and private payments with Apple Pay built in. [ Applause ] So, to do that, we've
added an NFC Radio and a secure element
inside of the iPhone SE. And we've launched Apple
Pay in these countries and we most recently
rolled it out on China where the response was
absolutely fantastic. We had over three
million cards added in the first 72 hours
alone, absolutely fantastic. And of course, the iPhone
SE meets our really high environmental standards. It is, of course, highly
recyclable aluminum and glass but it's got other recyclable
components and materials as well which both Lisa and Liam loves. And it's free from
that naughty list of environmentally
unfriendly materials as well. So as you can see, we've
added an incredible array of advanced technologies
to the iPhone SE in its really compact design which makes it the most
powerful four-inch phone ever. It really is an amazing device. So the iPhone SE,
what does it cost? Well, we're going
to start the price of the iPhone SE at only $399. [ Applause ] Which makes it our most
affordable price we've ever introduced a new iPhone at. And we have a higher capacity,
64 gigabyte model for just 499. And if you're on a two-year
subsidized service contract, you get the iPhone SE for free. But of course we know
installment plans have become incredibly popular, the
iPhone SE now starts at just $17 per month
without a service contract. So the iPhone SE joins our
incredible line up of iPhones with the iPhone 6, 6
Plus, 6s, and 6s Plus. It's the strongest iPhone
lineup we've ever had. We can begin, we'll
begin taking orders for the iPhone SE this
Thursday, March 24th and it'd be available next
week, so March the 31st. We'll be shipping first
in these countries but many more will
quickly follow. We'll be in more than 100
countries by the end of May. So that's the iPhone SE. [ Applause ] So whether this is
your first iPhone or you just love smaller phones, we think you're going
to love it. But I got more. Fundamentally important
of course to the iPhone experience is iOS. And iOS is the most advanced
mobile operating system in the world. And of course our
latest version, iOS 9 which was released
this past fall with incredible features
as well as improvements to the foundation of iOS. And iOS 9 today is running on
80% of our active iOS devices. That compares incredibly, favorably with the
latest version of Android also released this
past fall which is running on 2% of their active devices. And for the last couple of
months, we've been testing and publicly and previewing
iOS 9.3 which is one of the biggest dot
releases we've ever done. And it adds some new
innovations as well improvements to the wide range of apps,
so I'd like to share some of the highlights with you. Let's start with Night Shift. So studies have shown that
exposure to blue light in the evening can actually
make it harder for you to fall asleep at night. So Night Shift automatically
shifts the colors of the display to the warmer end
of the spectrum which may help you
sleep better at night. So how does that work? Well, when it's enabled Night
Shift uses your iOS device's clock as well as its
geolocation to know when it's sunset
in your location. And then it automatically
shifts the color of that display to the warmer end
of the spectrum which reduces the blue light
which may help you sleep better. It's a really cool feature, that's why I'm still
wide awake and alert. Notes. Let's talk about Notes. Notes is actually one of the
most used apps in the platform. It's used by literally hundreds
and millions of people every day and customers are loving the
newly redesigned Notes app in iOS 9. Well, today, we're
adding the ability to further protect your
most personal notes with a passcode or
a fingerprint. [ Applause ] Health. The health app gives
users a quick and easy dashboard with their health and fitness
data and there are already over 2500 apps that provide data
into the health app and we want to make it easier for
customers to find the right apps for their health
and fitness needs. So we've added great
app suggestions right into the health app so
you could easily add data to your dashboard. News. We introduced
Apple News with iOS 9 and it's become the
source of news for over 50 million
active users. And in iOS 9, we want
to make it even faster and more personalized. So we're adding top
stories to make it easier to track your news on your
iPhone or iPad, and for you, now suggests trending topics
as well as editor's picks. CarPlay. CarPlay is the safer,
smarter way to use your iPhone in your car, and every major
car brand has committed to integrate CarPlay into
their cars and already more than 100 car models have been
announced with CarPlay support and more and more keep coming. So you can expect to see
this in more and more places. And with iOS 9.3, it would
add even more useful features to CarPlay. For instance, your Apple Music
experience gets better with new and for you, which
provides songs, artists, albums handpicked by experts,
as well as selections based on your own preferences,
and maps gets even better. With the nearby feature which
allows you to find gas, parking, restaurants and more with
just a tap of your finger. Education. iPad with its powerful
features and apps opens up new and more engaging
ways of learning, and with iOS 9.3 using iPads
in the classroom is even easier and more powerful with a preview
of a new suite of software and capabilities that
are designed specifically for students, teachers
and administrators. [ Applause ] So that's just some of
the highlights of iOS 9.3. We think it's turned out
really great and it's going to make the best mobile
experience even better. And it's available as a free
update for all of you today. That's iOS 9.3 and iPhone SE. Thank you very much. [ Applause ] >> Thank you. It's a great update to iOS. I don't know about you
but I'm looking forward to sleeping better and
I'm incredibly excited about iPhone SE. Many, many customers
have asked for this and I think they're
really going to love it. Next up is iPad. We believe that iPad is the
perfect expression of the future of personal computing. We took a giant step in
this direction last fall with the introduction of
the 12.9-edged iPad Pro, and since then many
people are telling us that the iPad Pro has become
their primary computing device. We've got some exciting
news for you today. And to tell you all about it, I'd like to invite
up Phil Schiller. Phil? [ Applause ] >> Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I couldn't be more excited
to be the one to be able to tell you all about iPad. Customers really have fallen
in love with the new iPad Pro in the six months that
it's been on the market. They're in love with the huge
12.9-inch retina display, all its performance,
all the capabilities, the speaker system,
and the Apple Pencil. That is a true revolutionary
breakthrough. We're hearing so much from
customers around the world, customers like John Lasseter,
Chief Creative Officer of Pixar and Disney Animation Studios. John had this to
say, "The iPad Pro and the Apple Pencil are the
closest we've ever been able to get in the digital world
to actually drawing on paper." Or Stephen Gates, Head
of Design at Citi. "At Citi, iPad Pro is truly
transforming how we work. Our design team has
incorporated iPad Pro into their daily workflow,
allowing them to create, collaborate and share
ideas in new ways." And Alex Valdman, Head
of Design at Rapha. "iPad Pro goes with
me everywhere. For everything I do, including
designing the latest cycling collection, it has not
only replaced my laptop but my paper notebook as well." People love iPad Pro. It is a revolutionary device. And so, that's why, today, we're
so excited to introduce you to, for the first time, the second
member of the iPad Pro family. An entirely new iPad Pro based around a 9.7-inch
retina display. And it weighs less
than one pound. It is an iPad Pro
through and through. But why make a second
iPad Pro that's smaller? Well, there are two
really great reasons. First, we started iPad
with a 9.7-inch display for a very good reason, it's a
large enough display to get all of your work done, but small
and light enough to carry with you everywhere you go. People have loved the size. And from the beginning, it has remained our
most popular iPad size. In fact, I'm really happy
to tell you that to date, we sold over 200 million
iPads with a 9.7-inch display. So, for all of these
customers, when they learn about the features of
iPad Pro, they'll all see that it is their
ultimate upgrade. There's a second group of
people that would love to reach with this new iPad
Pro, Windows users. You may not know this. But the majority of people
come to an iPad Pro are coming from a Windows PC, a
desktop or a notebook. Now, of course, we all know, Windows PCs were originally
conceived off before there was an internet, before
there was social media, before there were app stores. And this is an amazing
statistic. There are over 600
million PCs in use today that are over five years old. This is really sad. [ Laughter ] It really is. These people, yes, could really,
really benefit from an iPad Pro. And when they see the features
and performance and capabilities of a product like the iPad
Pro designed for a modern and digital lifestyle,
well, many of them will find that it's their ultimate
PC replacement. Best of all, they can get access to all those incredible
apps in the App Store. And we're so happy to
tell you, there are now over one million apps in the
App Store designed for iPad. And they work beautifully
on iPad Pro. So let me tell you a lot more
about this brand new iPad Pro. First, it has a pro display. It starts with the
same materials used in a 12.9-inch iPad Pro,
an oxide TFT display driven by a custom Apple
timing controller. The custom controller has
a variable refresh rate. So it runs really fast
but power efficient. We use our photo
alignment technology to line the individual crystals so that it has incredible
contrast ratio and sharp text. But there's so much
more to this display. It is 40% less reflective
than an iPad Air 2. At just 1.8% reflectivity, it is the lowest
reflectivity of any tablet. And if you're a pro working,
you really appreciate that low reflectivity. And it's brighter too, 25%
brighter than an iPad Air 2. It puts out 500 nits of light. It makes it the brightest
tablet available. And there's a very
wide color gamut. It uses the digital
cinema's spec, DCI P3, which gives it a 25%
greater color saturation than iPad Air 2. In so many ways, this is the
best display we've ever built for an iPad. In addition, it supports two
really breakthrough features. The first, you've
heard about from Jos. It works with Night Shift. So as the sun goes down,
the brightness dims a bit, the blue light wavelengths
get reduced. And some people find that it
makes it easier to get to sleep. But the second feature is
a breakthrough that's never appeared on any device before. It's incredibly innovative. We call that a True
Tone display. A True Tone display measures
the color temperature of ambient light and
adjusts the display to match. I heard an oh out there. Somebody already gets this. This is great. It has two new four-channel
ambient light sensors that measure both brightness
and color temperature. So how does that work? Let's start with
a piece of paper. Piece of paper reflects light. So when you use it in
different environments, it reflects the color
temperature of the light in that
environment. Our optic nerves were designed to be comfortable
with this experience. If you go into the warm
incandescent light of your home and the paper takes
on a warm tone. But now you use a
digital device. Digital devices emit light. And that light has the same
color temperature no matter where it is. So the color cast isn't right. It doesn't match paper white. Well, except now if it's a
True Tone display, it does. No matter where you use it, it automatically senses the
color temperature of the light and becomes warmer or cooler
and matches paper white and it's really natural to use. Once you use a display with
this True Tone technology, you never want to go back
to old technology again. It is quite a breakthrough. [ Applause ] Next, it has pro audio system. It's four speakers
working the stereo system to adjust automatically the
frequencies between highs and lows depending
on how you hold it. It also puts up twice the
audio volume of an iPad Air 2. But best of all, this
has incredible level of performance unlike
any other mobile device. It has our fastest
chip ever, an A9X. This is a third generation
64-bit chip over 3 billion transistors. It's made with a 3D
FinFET architecture. If you don't know what that
is, it is unbelievably state of the art and people
are noticing. TechRadar wrote, "iPad Pro
packs powerful enough hardware to be a genuine laptop
replacement, with more than enough
grunt in terms of processor and graphics performance." And it has a ton of grunt. Twelve cores of graphics
delivering over half a teraflop
of graphics power. That's more than an Xbox 360
and a device that you hold in the palm of your hands. It's incredible for gaming. It's also incredible for
professional applications, modeling, rendering, just
fly on the new iPad Pro. And it's absolutely
enough performance for their great iOS 9
features from multitasking where you can have apps side
by side and video streaming, and picture in picture. It is an incredibly
powerful chip. It also, as Jos told you, includes our embedded
M9 motion coprocessor. With that, apps that use our
built-in sensors are instantly calibrated and up
and running quickly. It also supports "hey Siri". I said it that way because I
know it also sets off peoples phones when I do it. This means you can talk to
your iPad and you can ask it to open your mail and
check for new messages. You can talk to your iPad and
ask it to go to website or look up a contact and it can do
it all automatically for you. And the iPad Pro supports a
great line of pro accessories. There's a smart keyboard
designed specifically for the size at that
9.7-inch retina display. [ Applause ] As you put your iPad on, it just
automatically starts to work and the software adjusts. For example, my favorite
feature, command tabs, I can switch between my
multitasking applications just like on my desktop Mac. And it supports the greatest
accessory Apple has ever made, the Pencil. This is an amazing device. It's a breakthrough and
people are really falling in love with it. Christopher Phin of
Creative Bloq wrote, "Let me be completely clear, this is the best digital drawing
tool there has ever been." We couldn't agree more. It is an amazingly
precise drawing tool. It senses pressure. There's also a tilt angle
for amazing drawing. And you can draw it just
like you do on paper by putting your hands
on the iPad because of its built-in
palm rejection software. And it recognizes the pencil
as well as your fingertips. So you could use
both simultaneously to advance techniques for your
drawings, your illustrations. People love drawing and
doing illustrations on it. They also like taking
notes on it. It's an incredible device. There are other pro
accessories as well. A great new line of lightning
adapters, for example, a new lighting SD card
reader that's incredibly fast and this is a really powerful
accessory, a USB card reader. Sure, it lets you plug in your
camera which many of us do but because it's
powered you can use a lot of powered USB devices. For example, you can plug in
an ethernet adapter to get on your corporate network. And for those of you who are
podcasters you're likely to plug in a microphone and do your
podcast right from an iPad Pro. [ Applause ] Customers love taking photos
with their iPads as well. Certainly photos
for personal use but more importantly they can
use the camera for work as well. You can use the camera in
augmented reality apps. You can use it to
scan documents. You can use it to see
constellations in the night sky. There are so many great
uses for that camera. And in the new iPad Pro, we've put our most
advanced camera yet. It's a 12-megapixel iSight
camera with its Focus Pixels, True Tone flash, that amazing
image signal processor built into the A9X allows you
take pictures quickly with amazing color and
low noise, huge panoramas and beautiful live photos. And you can shoot
4K video with it. So right on your iPad
Pro, you shoot 4K video, you can edit multiple streams
right there on the device. There's a 5-megapixel Facetime
HD camera which is wonderful for doing video conference
calls. And again, the whole
displays of retina flash so you can take great
selfies with you and your friends as well. There are so many new features and innovations packed
into this iPad Pro. Hopefully you see what we do. This is the best upgrade
ever for every iPad owner. And it is the ultimate
PC replacement for all those old
PCs in the world. Like everything we do,
the team works hard to make it environmentally
friendly, mercury-free, LED-backlit display,
arsenic-free display glass, BFR-free, Beryllium-free,
PVC-free and highly recyclable
glass and aluminum. The iPad Pro comes in four
metal finishes, silver, gold, space gray, and for the
first time rose gold as well. [ Applause ] And there are great cases
and covers that you can add. They come in a variety
of beautiful colors. So this is the iPad Pro. With the 9.7-inch retina
display, what will it cost? Well, we're really excited to offer a 32 gigabyte
iPad Pro for just 599. That's $200 less expensive
than the 12.9-inch. And hope we can reach a
lot more customers with it. For 128 gigs for 749 and
for the first time ever in iOS device there's
a configuration now with 256 gigabyte in storage. [ Applause ] Orders begin this
Thursday, March 24th and they also start shipping
next week on the 31st. We are so excited
about this iPad Pro. The team has worked
so hard on it. We really love it and
we've created a brief video to tell you just a
little bit more about it. [ Music ] >> Our vision for personal
computing has always been that the most powerful
technology should deliver incredible capability
without the complexity. With the technologies
built into the new iPad Pro and the remarkable apps
that take advantage of them, it delivers a uniquely
intuitive and immersive way to do everything you do. iPad Pro changes the way
people discover, capture, edit, design and produce. At the heart of this
versatility is its performance. The A9X chip was designed
specifically for iPad Pro to provide more power than
most PCs in a thin, light, intuitive device you can
take anywhere with you. The immersive iPad experience
starts with its retina display. Each one is individually
calibrated, so you always see vibrant
color, contrast and clarity. The display on the new 9.7-inch
iPad Pro features a wider color gamut for even more
stunning imagery. It's also the first iPad
with the True Tone display, which responds and adapts
to the light around you. Four channel ambient life
censors measure the intensity and color temperature
of your environment and then adjusts the
display to match. So what you see on the screen
is more natural looking and easier on your eyes. To complement its vivid display, iPad Pro's four speaker audio
system produces high fidelity sound that automatically
optimizes the tab volume for whichever way
you're using it. [ Music ] Apple Pencil delivers an
experience that's natural, familiar and fluid with
the added versatility of a digital tool. Its advanced sensors
detect pressure and tilt while the touch system
recognizes your hand, fingers and Apple Pencil individually. So, when you rest your
hand on the screen, it ignores input
generated by your palm and forearm letting
you work as freely as you would on a
piece of paper. The smart keyboard was designed
to add even more flexibility. It works seamlessly with iOS 9 to add unique onscreen
shortcuts and commands. [ Music ] The iPad Pro display is
the ultimate view finder for capturing photos and videos. And the 9.7-inch iPad Pro
features the 12-megapixel iSight camera making it a powerful
device to shoot and edit, even 4K video wherever you are. The new iPad Pro gives
everyone the ability to do amazing things. Things you've thought
you can do only on a PC and things you've
never done before. It's where we believe
personal computing is going. [ Applause ] So these are all iPad Pros
now on two sizes starting at just 599 the 9.7 and
the 12.9 also now gets that new 256 gigabyte
configuration, so our highest end customers
are going to love that. This is the best lineup we've
ever had of iPads by far. It starts with just
an iPad Mini of 269. The iPad Air 2, which used to be our highest end 9.7-inch
iPad is now reduced a $100, to just 399. So a lot of customers
are going to like that. And the iPad Pros
start at just 599. So that's our news on
iPad, back to you, Tim. >> Thanks, Phil. We think whether you've
already have an iPad or whether it's time for you
to replace that PC laptop, the iPad Pro is an
amazing choice. It allows you to
do so much more. So you've seen some incredible
products this morning and some, just some great things
on two initiatives that are very important to us. Like our work to curtail
climate change by powering Apple on a 100% renewable energy, and CareKit transforming the way
individuals manage their health. Cool new bands for Apply Watch
now starting at just 299. A great update for Apple TV
with folders and expanded use of both Siri and dictation. The iPhone SE, the most powerful
four-inch phone ever created. And iPad Pro, so powerful and so
capable, it truly is the future of personal computing. We're always pushing forward
in innovating and doing things that positively affect
many people. It's something that Apple has
been doing for over 40 years. This is probably the
last product introduction in the Town Hall that
you're sitting in today. We've had a lot of
important announcements here. It's a very special place
with lots of memories. The iPod was announced in this
room and so was the App Store. We have lots of great
memories here. Next year, in 2017, we're
looking forward to moving -- [ Applause ] -- to our new campus and
our new theater there. And we expect that we're going
to have many, many opportunities to invite all of you
to join us there. We're looking forward to moving
and we can't wait to see what's in store for the next 40
years and share it with you. I'd like to thank
everybody for coming. Special thanks to everyone at
Apple who made today possible. Members of the press. We have a hands-on area across
the hall in the piano bar. And so, please go get your
hands on these great products. Thank you very much. [ Applause ] and explore
the world around you, with some great updates
to Wallet, Weather, and Maps. To tell us about what's new
in Wallet, here's Jennifer. [Jennifer] With the Apple Wallet
app, we set out to replace
your physical Wallet. Starting with Apple Pay, we added payment cards to make
payments safer and more secure. Next, we brought transit cards
with Express Mode to your iPhone. You just breeze through
the turnstiles in San Francisco, New York, Beijing,
Tokyo, and more. And just recently,
Walt Disney World added their park passes,
creating magical moments as you tap to enter,
ride, and explore. You can never leave home
without your keys, so we're continuing to add keys
to Wallet and making them even better. We started with car keys, which we're improving
with Ultra-Wideband support for an unlock and drive
experience. No need to take your iPhone
out of your bag or pocket. BMW and others will ship cars
with UWBs starting later this year. With iOS 15, we're bringing keys
for your everyday places to Wallet,
starting with where you live. We're creating the fastest,
most secure way to unlock your house,
apartment, or flat, and where you work. Just add your corporate badge and tap to enter your building
or office. And where you travel,
with hotel keys. You'll automatically
receive your key when your room is ready, even before you arrive
at the hotel. Starting this fall, Hyatt hotels
will start rolling this out to over 1,000 properties
worldwide, creating a faster and safer
experience for their guests. Anywhere you go,
just tap to unlock. An incredible range of partners
for locks and access systems have signed on to support keys
for all the places you go. However, to be fully free
of your physical wallet, there's one more thing
we need to bring to iPhone, and that's your ID. So we're bringing
identity cards to Apple Wallet. This fall, you'll just scan
your driver's license or state ID in participating
US states. It's that easy. Your ID information
is now in Wallet, encrypted and safely stored
in the Secure Element, the same hardware technology that makes Apple Pay
private and secure. And the TSA is working to enable
airport security checkpoints as the first place
you can use your digital ID. When you present your ID, you'll know what specific
information is requested and securely presented. With just a tap,
you're off to your flight. So that's Wallet on your
iPhone and Apple Watch. Back to you, Craig. [Craig] Next up, weather. The Weather app
is incredibly popular, and it's getting a huge update. First, we're introducing
a beautiful new design with data and layouts
that change based on conditions such as wind and rain,
unhealthy air quality, or sunny skies. We've also added
new weather graphics to help users
better understand conditions like wind, UV index,
and barometric pressure. And we've completely redesigned the gorgeous
animated backgrounds. There are now
thousands of variations that more accurately represent the sun position, clouds,
and precipitation. And Weather app in iOS 15 includes full-screen,
high-resolution weather maps. These maps show temperature, animated precipitation,
and air quality that provide a whole new way
to see the weather around you. Next, we have some
really big updates for another app our users
depend on every day. Apple Maps. Apple Maps is the best way
to navigate your world. It's easy to use
and beautifully designed, while providing the confidence
that your privacy is protected. Here's Meg to tell you more. [Meg] Two years ago, we started
rolling out our new map, offering richer details
and more accurate navigation to help you get around. Built from the ground up,
we've launched our new map so far in the U.S.,
UK, Ireland, and Canada, and we're excited to announce we're bringing the new map today
to Spain and Portugal, and later this year, we'll add Italy and Australia. Our goal has always been
to build the world's best map. So we looked at everything
we've done so far, and we asked ourselves, "How can
we push things even further?" We started by building
a gorgeous, interactive globe that invites users
to tap and explore. This is a whole new way
of looking at the world. But it's in cities where we're taking Apple Maps
to an entirely new level. Our current map is great,
and our users have told us it's a lot more useful
for navigation and exploration, but in iOS 15, Maps will offer
incredible new details for commercial districts,
marinas, buildings, and so much more. We've added things
like elevation, new road colors and labels, as well as hundreds
of custom-designed landmarks for places like Coit Tower
and the Golden Gate Bridge. And we built
a beautiful new nighttime mode with a moonlit glow. We think all of these
improvements are going to make
exploring a city so much fun for Maps users. And when a user is ready
to go somewhere, Maps in iOS 15 will make
getting there way better. Let's start with driving. We've added a great deal
of new road details to the map so we can help drivers
as they move throughout a city, to better see and understand
important things like turn lanes, medians,
bus and taxi lanes, and more. This outstanding
attention to detail, including the addition
of crosswalks and bike lanes, will help drivers more safely
navigate complex intersections. And when driving on highways,
Maps now renders overlapping,
complex interchanges in three-dimensional space, making it much easier to see
upcoming traffic conditions or to know which lane
you need to be in. And of course, we'll be bringing
this driving experience to CarPlay later this year. But it's not just driving. We've also made big improvements
for transit riders by helping them
easily find nearby stations. Users can pin their
favorite lines to the top and even keep track
on their Apple Watch so there's no need to take your
phone out of your pocket. Maps also automatically follows
your transit route, notifying you
it's time to disembark as you approach
your final destination. And if you've ever
exited a station, unsure of which direction
you need to go, Maps will help
get you back on track. Simply hold up your iPhone,
scan the buildings in the area, and Maps will generate
a highly accurate position, delivering detailed directions
in augmented reality to help you complete
your journey. We're launching this beautiful
new three-dimensional experience in these cities
by the end of 2021, with many more to come
next year. And that's the all-new
Apple Maps. Back to you, Craig. [Craig] So that's just some
of what's new in Apple Maps. An incredible new way to explore
the natural beauty of the world, and an amazing new
three-dimensional city experience
with improved navigation. iOS 15 is a great release
that helps you stay connected, find focus, discover more with
on-device-intelligence, and explore the worlred., n ZEROED IN ON KEY MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WITH ACCESS TO SOME OF THE MOST SENSITIVE AND SECRET INFORMATION.

MORE ON THIS TO UNFOLD the first glorious anniversary history a garden your ideology each one secure often the next is more powerful Beach water hobby on we are will one resolve one [Music] On January 24 Apple computer will introduce Macintosh and you'll see why 1984 won't be like 1984 this video is brought to you by morning brew hi welcome to today's episode of cold fusion before i start this episode isn't a recommendation to buy any of apple's products in fact i'm a windows and android user myself the following is simply my documentation of what i perceive to be the biggest moment in computing history in the last decade or so i think it's just fascinating so make sure you're comfortable for this one get out the popcorn and be ready to be entertained or learn a thing or two you are watching tv [Music] it seems that everyone hates apple these days and there's some rationale for that recently they've made their products impossible to repair increased prices of their products and accessories to a ridiculous level and enjoy excessive control but what if apple actually did something to push the industry forward and spur competition well it turns out that they may just have done that phones and computers are never seen as comparable when it comes to power they both live in different worlds though as long time subscribers would know back in 2012 i was comparing the two of them and seeing if a phone could replace a pc the rate at which phone power was improving year over year was absolutely unbelievable to me at the time those were some fun days the main difference between phones and desktop computers is that they use different types of processor technology phones use a type of processor design called arm while desktop computers generally use another type called x86 like intel for example arm is a simpler design than x86 making it more efficient but x86 traditionally used to be able to do more but this is changing the interesting thing to note is that in recent years our phones have been getting faster at a much more rapid rate than computers have been improving so here's a question what happens when the chips in our phones come close to the power of laptop and desktop computers what if you took this amazing performance and efficiency of a mobile chip and put it in the body of a laptop that is access to a larger battery and more space to breathe well things that many thought were impossible begin to happen and then i didn't plug it in for four days totaling a little over 10 hours of mixed use and still had 17 percent less animations are buttery smooth as you'd expect and even opening and closing some of those bigger apps like chrome and lightroom are just as fast if not faster than on my desktop which is sick it's just an overall really responsive feel okay look at this guy okay angelica when you're editing this show the footage from the surface pro x uh how that was the windows version of this there was extreme lag moving and doing anything and here it is extremely smooth and this is the base model macbook air without a fan these m1 macs are setting up the future of mac hardware as we know it is changing everything the new macbooks and the m1 chip that powers it resulted in an energy efficient chip as powerful as some desktop cpus what most people are missing is that this isn't an ordinary macbook the m1 chip represents the culmination of a decade of planning and a radical shift in the consumer computing industry on the surface putting a mobile chip in apple's best-selling computer seems really stupid but when you look deeper it makes a whole lot of sense as you'll see later it's actually a classic case of disruption as defined by clay christensen in 1997. so how did apple do this well the journey of how apple got to this point will be the subject of today's episode you will also see how intel's ceo refused to work on the iphone and made one of the biggest mistakes in tech history to truly understand what apple has done we first must go through some quick history central processing units or cpus are the brain of computers they do all the billions of calculations a second to make our devices run cpus run on what are called instructions these are the fundamental tiny bits of data that tell our computers what to do for example add these two numbers together fetch this number from memory that kind of thing when you group these commands together they're called an instruction set in the emerging battle between mobile and desktop cpus it would be the variations in how these instruction sets were handled that would make all the difference since its founding in 1968 by robert noyce and gordon moore intel has been the gatekeeper of mainstream computer cpus they would gain the name x86 after a series of popular chips in the late 70s and early 80s that ended in the number 86 the x86 instruction set architecture would go on to dominate the industry from the 1980s chip manufacturers would begin to add more and more complicated instructions to be perceived as better to a non-suspecting buyer over time these instructions made the chip's functionality bloated precious and limited physical space on the chip was being taken up by fancy instructions that were hardly ever used by the rest of the system meanwhile in the uk in 1983 a company by the name of acorn computers decided to go down a different path instead of making things more and more complicated why not take a simpler approach this mode of thinking was called risk a reduced instruction set computing as opposed to the bloated sisk from companies like intel some people are saying risk technology is the wave of the future other people are saying risk is already a passe technology what does this expert think well stuart the current ibm pc line that they're based upon a processor called the 8086. it's kind of a messy architecture so risk gives us as a new starting point we can say okay here's a simpler instruction set faster less code space well if you talk about risk is that a philosophy a way you design a machine architecture or is it a specific set of instructions it certainly is a philosophy or a style and in fact it's a style which differs depending on what you're trying to do the main idea is not to add any complexity to the machine unless it pays for itself by how frequently you would use it out of this came the acorn risk machine project otherwise known as arm this was the birth of the type of chips that would be used in all of our smartphones in the coming decades so in this episode for simplicity's sake we'll just refer to wrist chips as simplified cpus and cisc chips as complex cpus while developing the first arm chip during testing something unexpected happened here professor steve ferber speaks about how he started the arm project as we set about designing the arm we didn't really expect to pull it off okay firstly we thought this risk idea is so obvious that big industry will pick up on it and will get trampled underfoot we expected to go into this project finding out why it wasn't a good idea to do it and the and the obstacle just never emerged from the mist we just kept moving forward through the fog until eventually we had a fully working arm chip in our hands i don't think it was day one but a few days later we decided we'd better measure the power consumption so i turned the arm chip on ran some and some code on it looked at the ammeter and it was reading zero and i knew we designed a fairly low power chip but this was um a bit remarkable and it turned out that actually i'd in inserting the ammeter into the power supply i'd failed to connect the power supply and so no current was flowing through the ammeter but the chip was still running so hang on so it wasn't just you didn't connect the ammeter it was actually that you didn't connect the chip to the power supply yes there was no power supply connection to the chip and yet he was running by 1985 they had their first prototype and by 1987 the first computer based on arm was produced the acorn archimedes and from here arm would license its designs to other manufacturers for them to build at first being low power was a nice side effect but it didn't have much of an advantage for desktop machines but as portable computing devices started showing up arm became the first choice they were used in everything from nokias to ericsson phones so how are these arm chips so efficient [Music] when we talk about computer cpus we measure them in gigahertz and that means clock cycles per second simplified cpus such as arm generally will do one simple instruction per clock cycle while desktop chips may use many cycles to complete one complex instruction this means more power consumption less efficiency and more heat produced multiply this by hundreds of millions of times a second and the issue starts to become clear in some desktop cpus some of the complex instructions can take a dozen clock cycles or more to complete though contrary to popular belief both kinds of processes were flourishing during the 1990s in the early days simple instruction set designs were great for engineering and graphics so much so that computers using the technology helped create films such as jurassic park toy story and more simple instruction cpus were also used in the 3d graphics chip of the nintendo 64 and other early game consoles but the desktop market safely belonged to intel this symbol outside says inside you'll find a legacy of technological leadership the intel pentium processor for the next generation of compatible power that's intel the computer inside [Music] in 1991 apple ibm and motorola combined forces to create the power pc chip interestingly powerpc was a desktop chip but used simple instruction sets apple would proudly put them in their computers during the 90s the simple instruction arm cpu would get a huge boost in the form of the ipod in 2001 apple's use of the arm chip and the ipod was a microcosm for arm's popularity in portable devices from mobile phones to mp3 players by 2002 there were 1 billion arm chips and devices despite using arms simple cpus and their portable devices apple's power pc collaboration with ibm and motorola wasn't going so well their simple cpus were falling behind intel it was looking like intel and their complex cpu way of thinking was the way to go for the desktop market so apple left powerpc behind and yes it's true we are going to begin the transition from the power pc to intel processors when intel signed the deal with apple in 2005 apple was already thinking of what comes next they went to intel to see if they could power the upcoming iphone now at this time a moment occurred that intel would never forget paul ottolini ceo of intel at the time didn't see such a deal working out as it was far outside their speciality he didn't believe that intel could earn enough money by building mobile chips for apple's new iphone revenue wasn't going to cover the research costs or so he thought he couldn't imagine the iphone selling well this obviously proved to be a huge missed opportunity the iphone launched in 2007 using a simple instruction arm cpu if intel's ceo paul ottolini had made the deal happen they would have had a massive stake in the iphone business but unfortunately for intel apple was moving on without them in 2008 apple would sign an architecture license with arm this was so they could design their own chips from the ground up they would also buy pa semi a company whose founder previously specialized in high performance arm chip development this was a key strategic acquisition for apple it gave them the expertise and potential to design some of the best arm chips and put them on the road to disrupt intel and their x86 processors in 2012 apple releases their first fully custom designed cpu it would be code named swift and was used in the iphone 5. this was in contrast to using off-the-shelf designs from arm as they had previously done this new apple built chip was two times as fast as the previous chip even for being a first generation chip it had impressive performance when compared to the mobile competition but it wasn't head-turning the real shock to the industry came the next year in 2013 with the apple a7 in the iphone 5s apple's early adoption of a 64-bit architecture stunned everybody they even beat arm's own cpu teams by more than a year arm's own 64-bit design wouldn't be seen until late 2014 in the form of the galaxy s4 apple famously called their 2013 chip design quote desktop class architecture most people thought it was just apple bragging but this wording actually was a hidden clue as to where the company was heading as you'll soon see their latest custom chip does actually hold up with desktop pcs by 2014 there were 50 billion arm chips in the world all the while apple kept selling a bunch of iphones and making a heap of money and do you know what all of this revenue you can buy a ton of r d the chips inside of the iphone kept evolving and improving getting faster while using less power by the end of 2018 with apple's a12 chip it was looking like apple was catching up to intel in this chart the grey dots are apple and the blue squares are intel in the past five years intel managed to increase their flagship performance by about 28 percent in the same time apple managed to improve their designs by 300 and this is where things start getting very strange the intel chip at the top of this chart the core i9 10900k is a desktop chip that uses 125 watts of power it's the kind that you have to plug into a wall meanwhile apple's a14 chip in the iphone 12 the one in the top right hand corner that performs better than the chip i just mentioned uses 5 watts and is powered by a phone battery youtuber jonathan morrison does a test of exporting a heavy duty video file on a desktop versus an iphone 12. check this out this is a fairly capable machine it's a 10 core it's got a beefy gpu and what i have here is sony fx9 hdr 10-bit footage we're going to start that i'm going to throw this open we're gonna see a couple of things right we're gonna see the cpu cores just spike up and you should start hearing the fans now in the meantime while this thing is chugging along i have the iphone 12 mini little guy keep in mind this thing is still slowly chugging along i'm going to open up imovie create a movie the first thing you notice is just the scrubbing in the playback right so this is a fanless teeny tiny iphone 12 and just butter so what i'm going to do is take that export make sure we're in 4k on 20 battery hdr keep in mind this thing's still going it's got a nice little head start right so this is on a battery about 20 left no fan and this is a decked out imac the thing to note here is that the iphone chip does have hardware acceleration but it can be argued that this is just a smarter way of doing things anyway the m1 chip is even faster than this looking at this and the speed at which apple's chip performance was accelerating apple pretty much was forced to ditch intel and their x86 platform intel was just too slow to innovate they were struggling to keep up with the manufacturing technology whereas apple could outsource manufacturing of their custom arm designs to others like samsung the performance lead of intel's desktop cpus were being evaporated right in front of everyone's eyes by 2019 the ipad was more powerful than the intel macbook pro of the previous year this is something i mentioned in a previous episode the speed of all of these advancements would come back to shock people in 2020 if you're interested in this episode so far you might be keen on some more tech news from today's sponsor morningbrew apple has announced that from the 1st of january they'll be lowering their app store fees from 30 to 15 this is in response to the anti-trust allegations from the united states and

the iphone and then apple decided to do it themselves by acquiring a company and then with this expertise apple has pushed the state of the art forward until mobile phone chips were comparable to pcs and now it was time for arm and apple to take on the pc head on in november of 2020 apple reveals its new processor to take on the pc it's called the m1 the company's first custom cpu designed with max in mind it features 16 billion transistors 35 more than the a14 inside the new iphone 12 and because it's arm-based and shares the same dna as the iphone the new macbook can run ipad and iphone apps all with transistors on a five nanometer process early testing of the chip is blowing the online tech reviewer community off their feet proceeded to annihilate the other tests posting 1744 on single core which is faster than every intel mac ever made now badeem really wants to jump in uh in front of the camera and give his opinion all right so i have a 2018 base 15-inch macbook pro i tried playing league of legends it's not smooth it's glitchy you get dropped frames and i'm just blown away that we're getting native resolution everything maxed out getting around 60 fps and you have a dedicated graphics card in that yes it has a dedicated chip and this is under rosetta not even optimized it's not even optimized for apple silicon these are legit this is super fast to the point where i had a friend he actually makes an app a pretty well known app he uses a hackintosh 3950x 16 core really decked out system specifically for development right this is his build time somehow these m1 devices are keeping up one of them being fanless it's pretty crazy and this was the moment like when i got the numbers back i was like this is this is real apple silicon is real if apple as a company is to continue on their current performance trajectory it's going to be insane to see here's a quote from anandatech quote apple claims the m1 to be the fastest cpu in the world given our data on the older a14 beating all of intel's designs and just falling short of amd's newest zen 3 chips we can certainly believe that apple and the m1 will be able to achieve that claim amd has shown lots of progress lately however it'll be incredibly hard to catch up with apple's power efficiency if apple's performance trajectory continues at this pace the x86 performance crown might never be regained end quote when you are aware of the wider applications of arm in the real world it was only a matter of time the fastest supercomputer in the world the japanese fugaku is three times faster than ibm's and it uses arm architecture though this is the clincher needing a more powerful computer isn't relevant to everyone but having more efficiency and less power consumption is and it's something that everyone can notice clay christensen who wrote the book innovator's dilemma in 1997 states that disruptive innovations quote involve no new technologies rather they consist of components built around proven technologies that are put together in novel architectures offering the consumer a set of attributes never before available and he goes on they are quote initially used only by the unsophisticated consumers of the low end markets so arm chips have existed since the 1980s but in the current day they've traditionally only been used for lower end items like smartphones for example though putting arm chips in a laptop has existed for a long time windows has done this for years but having an arm chip that is so powerful that it can reach the top end of the consumer computer market is new christiansen who wrote this quote shows a chart of disruptive technologies 25 years ago look carefully at this what does it look like steve jobs even had something to say about this speaking at the launch of his next computer he said that all systems and architectures have about 10 years of life at the start you have to get people to build applications for it and around year five it reaches its architectural peak quote then it goes on what you might call a glide slope the architecture is everything it's going to ever be at that point so what about program compatibility well according to earlier reviews the cpu is so powerful that it has similar or better performance running apps that weren't even designed for it according to the verge it's so good that they couldn't even tell if the apps running were coded for arm or not so in conclusion despite no upgradable ram a hefty upgrade price and no external gpu support the big story here is the chip architecture and nothing else it's proving that arm can have an inherent advantage in the laptop and desktop space this moment was decades in the making i feel honored to have been around to witness it things are going to get super interesting from here on out and i can only hope that competition arises from this moment this is so us as consumers can win though it's strange how there are those out there who get upset over this can't we just enjoy the progress that's being made instead of ridiculing each other over our technology preferences i'm just happy that the technology is moving and competition may come from it this performance increase is the biggest gap that we've seen in many many years and i think it's awesome and that's the end of the story so thanks for watching are you guys excited for future laptops that have extremely long battery life and have the cpu power of desktops these kinds of machines can be less expensive and do wonders for students and professionals alike anyway that's it from me i do want to make a quick mention that i've got some new merch just in time for the holiday season so if you're feeling festive you can pick some up in the description below anyway my name is dagogo and you've been watching cold fusion and i'll catch you again soon for the next episode cheers guys have a good one cold fusion it's new thinking um [Music] you Back in 2015, Apple introduced the 12-inch
MacBook. The first model ever to feature an Apple logo
that didn’t light up. And since then, the MacBook Pro and MacBook
Air have also received the same treatment. This caused some controversy, since the glowing
Apple logo has been around for over two decades and has become an iconic design element of
Apple’s notebooks. So why was the illuminated Apple logo removed? Well, that’s exactly what I’ll explain
right now. So when the 12-inch MacBook was introduced,
it was the thinnest model in Apple’s history. In fact, at 13.1 millimeters, it was 24% thinner
than the MacBook Air. But that dramatic improvement didn’t come
without compromises. For example, Apple had to create a new super-thin
keyboard that featured butterfly mechanisms instead of the traditional scissor design. They claimed the new keyboard was an improvement,
but that didn’t turn out to be the case. It was extremely faulty and resulted in a
class action lawsuit, with Apple eventually reverting back to the scissor keyboards. But another compromise of the 12-inch MacBook
was the non-illuminated Apple logo. Since the display was so thin, two problems
arose. First, if there was a strong light source
behind the display, you could actually see a subtle hotspot in the center of the screen. Since the glowing Apple logo was a transparent
cutout that allowed the display’s backlight to shine through, but also allowed external
light to enter. This meant using the MacBook outside could
cause color inaccuracies on the display. So to eliminate this potential issue, Apple
had to seal off the display’s chassis entirely, which meant getting rid of the translucent
logo. But there was another benefit to this approach,
the thinness of the MacBook’s display combined with the Apple logo cutout, caused structural
rigidity issues. Just like the iPad Pro was easily bent thanks
to the Apple Pencil attachment cutout, the MacBook could’ve easily been bent due to
the Apple logo cutout. So replacing its weak spot with a piece of
metal, helped eliminate this structural weakness. The third reason why Apple got rid of their
glowing logo is for purely aesthetic reasons. Back when the trend started in 1999 with the
PowerBook G3, Apple was mounting a comeback. Steve Jobs had just returned to the company
three years prior, and he put a huge focus on establishing a new reputation for Apple. Since they’d fallen out of favor with customers
over the past decade. That’s what sparked the Think Different
ad campaign, and radical new computer designs like the iMac and PowerBook. It was the first time a glowing Apple logo
had been used, and it was crucial in creating brand awareness. Seeing a prominently displayed Apple logo
in public reminded people that the company was still around, and was actually creating
some really cool products. But today, Apple has been moving away from
this overt brand strategy and shifting to something more subtle. For example, they could’ve put an Apple
logo on the AirPods Max, like almost every other headphone manufacturer, but they didn’t. Also, with the 24-inch iMac, Apple removed
their logo from the product’s chin for the first time since 2004. And it makes sense why they don’t need their
logo to be as overtly display anymore. Apple isn’t struggling to garner attention
or win customers from other brands. They’re by far the biggest and most recognizable
tech company in the world. With almost every product they create dominating
their respective market. Apple has also been unifying their product
design in recent years. And since the iPad, iPhone, and Mac desktops
all have non-illuminated Apple logos, it makes sense to carry that design language through
to the MacBook line. So while it’s understandable to feel sentimental
about losing the glowing Apple logo, it can also spark some excitement. Since it represents a new era of Apple, with
plenty of incredible products yet to come. This is Greg from Apple Explained, thanks
for watching till the end, and I’ll see you in the next video. Chad Wild

an Apple Store near you! [Transcribed by Tech Off] - At last year's WWDC when
Tim Apple got on stage and proudly announced the
transition to Apple Silicon, it blew the lid off the tech space, which is why it's so baffling that now in the exact middle of
Apple's two-year transition away from Intel CPU's, they announced... (drum roll) No hardware whatsoever. So what did they announce? And should we have
bothered to bust our butts to make this same day
reaction video at all? It's unclear, but what
is clear is blah blah and who's our sponsor,
Ridge Wallet, that's who. Ridge Wallet has redefined

performance core Jade C dies had us salivating at the thought of high thread count Apple Silicon but unfortunately, that's not what we got. Although we did get little
hints here and there about what Apple's doing
for their future hardware. One big indicator is that all
of Siri's voice recognition will now be processed on-device rather than being sent up to the cloud. And this is huge, huge, because it's not only better for privacy it's a lot faster and a lot more reliable in areas with spotty coverage, making Siri way more useful, full-stop. Not only that, but
they're also implementing what is essentially Nvidia's RTX Voice and background blurring
for FaceTime calls, along with expanding spatial
audio for group calls so voices appear to come from where each person's feed
is situated on your screen. Wow, it feels like they're really standing around me in a circle like
they did before the bad times. There are even more new
machine learning features being rolled out across the whole range of Apple's new operating systems, including the ability
to detect and recognize any kind of text in an image, or even things like dog breeds or plants, and that information
then gets contextualized and becomes searchable. If that sounds like a lot of
work for a phone processor, you're right. So it sounds like Apple's planning on a pretty big boost to
the iPhone soC this fall, if you ask us. You probably shouldn't be surprised that Apple focused on
software this morning, it is the worldwide developers
conference after all. But what's cool is that
a lot of the new stuff they talked about is applicable across the whole lineup of their products. For example, SharePlay, which lets you have
listen and watch parties and screen share all through FaceTime. And to try and do that before,
you needed third-party apps or at the very least, a good
stopwatch, but no longer. Support for SharePlay
is rolling out initially for services like Hulu,
HBO Max and Disney+ with more undoubtedly to come. Obviously Android users can't join a SharePlay enabled FaceTime session but what they can do now,
for the first time ever, is to join a regular
FaceTime call using a link. Wait, so Apple made a
FaceTime app for Android? No, no, no, no. You have to use the
browser because you're poor but you can still talk to
your rich friends, very cool. Now for groups of friends
who all have iDevices, sharing links, images and other content has been cranked up to 11 with a new Shared with
You section in many apps. In iMessage, you can now
pin specific messages to read later, which is super useful to someone like me who
leaves people on read to remind myself to reply later, but kind of like mark
unread an or an email. And if your device is
in, do not disturb mode, other iDevice users will be
able to see that you're busy and we'll have the option
to notify you anyway which kind of undoes the
whole do not disturb thing but whatever. I'm sure this will be completely abused by certain people in your contact list, and, I don't know how it's going to work for people not using that
device, but hey, it's a thing now just like our water
bottles from lttstore.com except we know how they
work, they hold liquid. Speaking of do not disturb,
it's been incorporated into a broader feature called Focus which allows you to set customizable modes for work, personal time, or say fitness. This means that you can customize which notifications will
come through and from who, which apps are shown on your home screen while it's switched on, and a lot more. And it can be set either
manually or automatically based on time and location data. To compliment that, there's a
new design for notifications with larger icons big
and profile pictures. Amazing, 2021. And the ability to group
certain notifications, like from promotional or news apps into notifications summaries that you can receive at
the time of your choosing. This honestly sounds like it
could significantly cut down on notification clutter,
and maybe that app that constantly spams
notifications at you for no reason, but has some useful notifications
sometimes that you do want can finally stop annoying
you throughout the day, I'm looking at you Google News. Let's, see what else? Redesigned weather app with beautiful new animated backgrounds, new maps designed with crosswalks, traffic lights and 3D building models. Apple Wallet is getting a house
key and personal ID support that totally won't be a security concern. Auto translation, that's
actually really cool but there's not much to say about it. New memoji outfits? hearing about privacy features
during these event things is usually a bit of a slog but Apple made this one
a bit more interesting by essentially introducing
what is a VPN, or two VPNs? Because the new iCloud+ subscription includes something called Private Relay, which bounces your internet
traffic, not once but twice so not even Apple knows
what you're doing out there, presumably. You can also create
single use email addresses to give to sketchy companies
when you make an account, and on some plans, get
unlimited storage for video from HomeKit enabled security cameras. And this feels like a
slog again, let's move on. Oh, the iPad. Apple's brought the
home screen up to parity with the iPhone. Widgets can now be placed anywhere and there's an app library that can live on the
dock for quick access. What's more, you can easily
hide rearrange home screens now which Android's had for a while, but hey, better late than never. More importantly, multitasking sucks less, a new floating menu makes it
a bit easier to split screen and app windows can be
minimized to a shelf and then can be added to a
new split-screen workspace. Combine that with the new
Universal Control feature that lets you share input
between multiple Macs or iPads and you've got a formidable
multitasking setup if your workflow includes the iPad. Universal Control is actually really cool and it's basically a refined Apple flavored version of Synergy that automatically arranges and extends to devices immediately nearby. presumably only those signed
into the same Apple ID, you know, for security, But this is wild, you can drag and drop
content between your devices and even across a device
to a third device, so your weird iMac,
MacBook, iPad desk setup will finally make some
sense, at least to you. Seriously though, this could be a pretty dang useful feature, and when that compliments
another new feature, Airplay to Mac. Now, we just did a video on Luna Display, a dongle that allows you
to connect a Mac or iPad as a secondary display,
similar to Apple's own Sidecar. What we liked about Luna
Display was it's flexibility. Apple hasn't offered a way
to make another Mac a display since target display died off, and we weren't happy about it. And then they go ahead and Sherlock it with their own implementation. That video isn't even on YouTube yet so the timing is just
fantastic, thank you, Apple. No word on compatibility yet though but presumably you'll need
the latest release of macOS which Apple has dubbed
Monterey, after the bay. Monterey supports virtually all of the new features
we've talked about so far, and some we haven't. Quick Notes are one of
them, and they're on iPad 2. Basically these are
context sensitive notes that you can take quickly and have synced across sessions and devices that lets you do things like skip through web pages with copied text, save specific snippets from apps, and search through them using Spotlight. It's a pretty smart feature and one that along with tags and mentions for groups should help with making the
notes app itself more useful. Shortcuts are also coming to macOS and since shortcuts are basically a more user-friendly version of Automator, macOS users will be able
to import Automator scripts until Apple phases out that old
lame not colorful enough app in about two years, I'm guessing. speaking of old lame app designs, Safari looks way better now. They've moved the address/search bar directly into the active tab itself and the tab bar is located
at the top of the window as if it were the title. The tabs themselves are made smaller and they can now be grouped without the need for
an external extension, with those groups extending
across all devices. And speaking of extensions, iOS and iPadOS will now also fully support
Safari web extensions, meaning things like Honey can now be installed on those platforms. On the iPhone where the tab
bar doesn't really exist, the old address bar is now
near the bottom of the screen where you can swipe left and right to quickly switch between tabs, or swipe up for an overview. Seems pretty slick, but we'll
have to get our hands on it to know for sure, so make
sure you hit subscribe so you don't miss that coverage. Developers are getting access to all of these fancy
OS changes this month, while next month public betas go live, and final releases will
presumably coincide with another Apple event in the fall. There's obviously more things here that we don't have time to talk about like new HomeKit stuff, the AirPods enhancements
including Find My support, and the health stuff but this
video is already long enough. WWDC was a nearly two hour stream and we're still kind
of processing all of it so maybe you can check out

Go get em, tiger. ♪ Hey hey hey yeah oh oh oh ♪ [Music] hey what is up guys i'm pbht here so in case you somehow missed it apple's WWDC was this week and the stuff they announced there has been making tech headlines pretty much every day since so typically when Apple gets up on stage this shares something that they've been you know working on behind the scenes for a long time and they're finally able to share it with the world they get on stage and they share it and then there's a sort of reaction from the Internet everyone's blog in tweeting making their videos about it and then apples usually just like zip nothing they never really reply that's typically where the conversation ends but not this year 2020 in many ways is a little different so after the keynote this year after their online only presentation I got to have a conversation with the man you may recognize from tons of FaceTime in the keynote singer VP at Apple Craig federighi we had a decently long chat on the wave form podcast with a whole range of topics from the behind the scenes of how they made that to our keynote movie basically to all the software and the new stuff that they've announced and you know it's not all roses and flowers some of the stuff they announced was pretty controversial too so luckily enough I was recording video on my end Craig had some iPhones set up recording his end in Apple Park so if you want more of the summary of the really long list of things that they've announced that are new you can go back and watch my last two videos that go into that stuff in lots of detail but this this is the more rare conversation part all right so point number one default apps so you may remember one of the new announcements in iOS 14 was the ability to newly change your default mail or browser apps and the reaction to that was at first largely very positive including for me that's like a from a very traditionally stubborn company from like Apple not something you would expect but then after like a day or two of digestion the questions start coming up well what about Maps why not other things too here's what he had to say I did hear that you were looking forward to using alternatives you do too yeah yeah I mean there you go hello everybody I love that extra layer I think my actual question to that is okay it's only male and browser is there a reason you didn't have full on you know chaos or a or even just because I think maps would have been nice to also be able to set as a default you know honestly a a great point I mean I think for us we looked at what were the top things that we've been hearing people say they wanted to configure and there's definitely those two that rose to the top so I'll certainly take the input about about maps as well it was this was this was just where we started I think your point on on chaos is an important one I mean obviously with with iOS we're very careful about trying to keep we know how platforms can sort of descend into chaos and particularly when apps that you know might honestly not even be browsers you know who decide they're gonna be a browser and then you know try to hook into being your browser because maybe they could redirect you to a different track tad experience when you click on something or bounce you into you know who knows what and so we are very careful about making sure that that experience that we don't have people getting misled or have their device gets configured into a place where boy they just don't even like like using their their of their phone anymore because it's gotten so walked up so we proceed cautiously on these things for sure does that mean there will be I assume well maybe I shouldn't assume that not every app can add that flag to potentially be a default browser but only certain approved ones yeah you're exactly right so so we will have criteria for the you have to be a general-purpose browser and they'll be I mean the ones you would think of as using as your browser well of course all qualify but we don't want a random game to just claim like yeah I'm a browser you know I'm willing to throw up a WebKit view now and then in in the middle of my game experience I'm gonna be your browser because we think that could could readily be abused so we want real general-purpose male apps and real general-purpose browsers to be able to present themselves to the user with this functionality and keep out all the rest of the confusion gadget so the browser point I think is actually a really good one something to sort of think about a little bit if any app can just become your browser when any link comes up and then that app has different policies on tracking and privacy then it sort of goes against your own policies on tracking and privacy now we see this on Android all the time and it's actually more of a feels like a convenience and more customization feature but in relay for reddit for example if I click a link to read a story it doesn't have to open Chrome there's a browser built into the app here so it just opens that and that's convenient but Craig's response here is basically that sometimes Apple has to take a stance against some of that convenience in favor of maintaining their own pretty strict privacy policy make sense then next up was Siri so Siri got a bunch of improvements in iOS 14 as well answers a bunch of new questions now and it also is in this compact new UI with a much smaller animation I pointed out in my videos and a lot of people also reacted that you couldn't really interact with things behind Siri despite that smaller animation Syria also gets a new compact UI both on the phone yeah and on the iPad but something that we've noticed since using it is it is a compact UI but you can't interact with things underneath or behind it hmm is that intentional is that a limit Varian what's what's that's where I know no one in fact you know we tried it both ways we we had internally we had prototypes running where you would scroll behind the Siri answers as you brought them up and initially we thought that was going to be really great and so we implemented it that way and then what we found was that for most of the interactions we were having with Siri that that then created this kind of extra heaviness to it because if you just said wanted to check the weather or look up a piece of information and then you were ready to move on your scroll gesture wasn't going to move on the Siri result was going to stick around there so you always had this additional step of dismissing the result and we found that to be extra heavy and so you know we'll continue to listen to what people have to say through the beta period cuz like I say I mean we've we actually have it working both ways but but our feeling was that we wanted to achieve a great lightness not just visually but in terms of you could dip into Siri get an answer and and move on quickly without any kind of overhead in the subsequent interaction so there's there's definitely real balance there yeah I felt that the experience is a little different on the phone versus the tablet you know on the phone it felt like it made sense I'm not necessarily reading or scrolling or doing things behind Siri very often but the tablet with a bigger screen to me felt like opportunity to give me a little more of like the the multitasking feel that I talked about on iPad yeah where you do feel like you have a little more control over leaving Siri there while you do other things and coming back to it so that might be something to look into yeah did you have a thought about what you how you would have expected if you were to let's say start you know you got your answer and then you started scrolling and doing other things on your iPad yeah at what point you would expect Siri to kind of get itself out of the way or whether you would have preferred you know have it hang out for minutes and then you go over there and manually put it away yes so I think because that animation came in from the bottom and then the answer came in from the top I almost felt like it would be different behavior on the phone but I almost felt like just being able to swipe it out of the top where it came from to deserves it sort of like a notification even though it isn't one or bringing that Siri animation from the bottom corner and just swiping it down out of where it appeared so that's again there's probably a thousand ways to to also consider doing it but I think that just because I'm such an iPad multitasking advocate I think that would be something I'd be interested in alright so there you go makes sense to me the one extra step of dismissing Siri is one extra step they feel like they wanted to avoid but also again I think it's important to mention that these are the videos I was making were about developer betas and these are early software that can continue to be changed down the road he mentions they could change it so if they do see that behavior change maybe they've thought about it more alright so then the big one Mac OS Big Sur new visuals new rounded corners new icons I had to talk about it seeing all those visual changes it got a very mixed reaction online and I'll share some of mine after but yeah there's a there's a sort of an overarching theme of these rounded corners and a new transparent and a different sort of look to it can you talk about mm-hmm that theme of Mac OS Big Sur yeah well I think the the first thing just to address the the eleven point Oh I mean we do feel that between the the new design and the the beginning of a new chapter with the introduction of Apple silicon I mean I think this is this is just the beginning I mean this is a this is a real renewal of the platform in many ways and so we're really excited to mark this with the next chapter the turning into the next chapter with with with eleven as far as the the design goes you know I think it's huge part of our visual scenery of our lives at this point and so what seems right is partly what we're used to seeing on that screen every day and when it changes immediately there's all kinds of little pattern recognizers in our brain that go like hold on something that's different something I feel like after you use the UI for and I've been living on it for months it feels natural it feels fresh and yet clearly distinctly Mac and I love it and I think that it's natural the first time you you see it and and of course the internet reacts on like they see a single screenshot and then let's start a tweet storm and then let's pile on they they don't they don't necessarily live on it right and so I would love to hear the feedback of people as they've if they've really made it their system like they have the previous Mac you eyes for you know for weeks and and come back and say how do you feel about it now I think the design team did amazing work and I I find you know things like rounding you know the some of those choices may seem arbitrary but in fact it's extremely consistent throughout that whole experience and I think it's really organic you know straight edges like this or like the process of human manufacturing processes you know if you look out in nature if you look at our own faces it's a lot of curves right a natural curves and so I think there's something really beautiful and organic about the the look of the UI and I think the the use of the use of materials is really great the clarity of some of the unified toolbars I think is is just clean and fresh and really deferential to content and then of course I mean it's a big step to change the icons of the Mac that's certainly a signature change but what we found when we live on it is we're moving back and forth between our iPhone our iPad or Mac and having that consistency in familiarity just takes a level of sort of mental mapping energy out of the whole thing and it's just it's relaxing it's comfortable it's it's clear and so you know we approach that decision with a lot of a lot of debate but in the end we we tried it and it just it just felt right and I think as people use it they're gonna come to the same conclusion yeah those new icons are not from iPad or iPhone right they're new they're a totally new icon set as far as like finder and and Spotify and Final Cut like all these new apps on the Mac we did not create a Spotify or you would not make we would not make that step I mean it might be fun to try but I don't think we're allowed to do that right we we did you're right so there's some Mac some icons like like finder exactly where there's no analog and so we got to imagine with the new shape and aesthetic how should should the Mac look and I think I love what we came up with there then there are other icons like say Safari or messages where we took the iOS icon and the typical you know Chiclets shape but applied a little bit of the traditional mac craft to to it and I think that's been where there's some of the controversy right now where people are saying hold on I know what that iPhone icon looks like and this one seems just a little different something tripping here and going like this isn't quite right and you know that's that's natural and understandable but we we did want to pay homage to that history of great craft and detailing that's been part of the Mac the history of Mac icons and so we kind of brought those those two together and hopefully in the end successfully I think this is all a very eloquent way of saying you'll get used to it and I think that's that's kind of she's got good point you probably will eventually get used to it after a while but the other thing is design is subjective and sometimes there are designs that even if you do get used to them you still don't like them like for me an example is on my phone I use Waze for navigation I don't use Apple maps or Google Maps that much anymore and that's because I like the feature set but every time I open ways I hate looking at it it's just this ugly it doesn't look good it's not clean or elegant or flat or minimal or modern or anything every time I open it I hate it but I don't switch because it still has the feature set I like and I feel like Apple knows that and they also know people aren't going to switch off from mac OS because they didn't really like the new icons people complain about iPhones all the time and then what are they go out and buy the next iPhone so he's got a point we'll get used to it but also Craig or anyone else at Apple who may stumble upon this video I talked about the other icons and how I might not like them and that's preference but this battery icon in System Preferences I you gotta fix this one I'm sorry there's just there's no way this should make it out of the beta please change this battery icon alright I got I got a couple fan questions as well I asked okay I put it out on YouTube we had some some questions and were gonna have Craig on the podcast first one the iPad still does not have a default weather and calculator app and they want to know why you know there's some things that we we have not done because we to do it we would want to do something really distinctly great in that space and I think it's obviously easy to create a calculator app but creating one that feels like wow this is this is this is the greatest iPad calculator app that it felt like I think we we want to do it when we can do it really really well and and we we honestly have just haven't gotten around to doing it great so that day that day may come but and you know whether it be easy enough to scale up our additional our existing weather app but we feel like what would a great weather app for iPad be like let's let's do that before we do it in otherwise the great options on the App Store I mean though there are there are thousands of options on the App Store in fact so very true I think this one resonates to me because one of my favorite apps you guys just acquired dark sky so it's no longer on Android so I'm like this this iOS weather app better turn into this amazing thing some I think I think it may be time for an iPad weather app that's just me I'm just saying alright faint well and it could be could be time for you to go iPhone exclusive I think that that would be another another good move that's a big point of leverage you make a great point another question is a there's a there's a very small group of people out there apparently that have an iPad and want to use an Apple watch but don't have an iPhone mmm is this a workflow you guys think about or are there groups with people who maybe that's too small of a group of people to cater to but will there ever be an iPad Apple watch experience we don't know I mean I I get it I think I think there's an interesting place where Apple watch can for many people take that kind of the device that I need to have with with with that having LTE it can be that device that gives you the degree of connectiveness connectedness on-the-go and then you've got your your iPad when you want to get deeper and it's a sensible it's a sensible point it is not one that we have pursued yet I mean I wouldn't rule it out but so I I get it I I love using my iPad and I love using my Apple watch so I could I could understand that so there you have it some interesting stuff some some new information and some clarifications on stuff that's already been announced good conversation material and again it's a much longer fuller more detailed conversation over on the wave form podcast so in case you want more Quarantine content or if you haven't listened to my podcast yet feel free to hit the link below the like button to check it out we've got other guests on previous episodes too but you can subscribe and listen to it anywhere podcasts are but let me know what you think in the comments section below and we can continue the conversation 20/20 style thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one shout out to expressvpn for sponsoring this video so if you like me and you feel like you've watched nearly everything online the number one thing you need is expressvpn see streaming services like Netflix have different shows and movies available in different countries which means there are titles out there that you didn't even know that you don't have access to but expressvpn lets you change your location which essentially unlocks all these different shows and titles that Netflix and other streaming services have so I've been using expressvpn to watch Star Trek discovery which is only available for Netflix in the UK it was pretty easy you just fire up the expressvpn app change the location to the UK and then refresh Netflix or whatever service you're using and that's it it's fast it works on a computer or on my phone or even on the TV so you can watch these new things on a big screen look you've heard me talk about VPNs before and why they're so important for online security and privacy but expressvpn is the one I trust because they explicitly do not track any of your online activity and they've even gone above and beyond to engineer every single one of their VPN servers to run only in RAM which means even if there was a bit of data tracked which there isn't it would be gone with a reboot so thanks to them being such a good partner with the channel I'm giving away three extra months of expressvpn for free so if you want to take advantage of this content boosting VPN feel free to head over to expressvpn comm slash mkbhd so that's been it thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace [Music] the iphone 13 has all the upgrades you wanted to see and i'll be sharing the details right after this [Music] the iphone 13 launch is approaching and now that design is being finalized and mass production of components has begun we have plenty of great news on the hardware before we get started though please like the video if you're an apple fan let me know in the comments what device you're watching today's video on and don't forget to hit subscribe so you don't miss a thing so the first story of the day is that we're getting a darker graphite color in the iphone 13 pro the leak comes from max weinback and everything apple pro and they state that it's going to be much darker than in the 12 and close to the hex code here it's reportedly going to be a matte color and we've also got news of a new stainless steel coating to reduce smudges and fingerprints on the back we also had news last week of apple ordering many key components for the iphone 13 and that mass production is starting one of the main areas for the iphone 13 upgrade is the camera and according to digi times apple has put a notice to their supplier of components for their cameras and they have to increase capacity by up to 40 percent now these are for voice coil motor components and they're required for the upgrades in the camera modules and 3d face id now this news is making many think that all iphone 13 models are going to be getting a lidar scanner but it's currently looking like only the pro and the pro max are going to have that although news of sensor shift stabilization across all of the iphone 13 models does seem to be correct everything apple pro and max weinbach also advise us of new stabilization in the iphone 13 that's going to work across all resolutions and frame rates there aren't too many details on it just yet but they're calling it warp and it's going to be part of the electronic stabilization considering the stabilization on the 12 range it was already incredible then this should make some very smooth handheld footage we also had news last week of increased battery capacities across the whole of the iphone 13 range and it appears that that is correct or not as required in the pro max the smaller models definitely needed that boosting capacity well it didn't happen last year this year we are definitely getting at 120 hertz in the pro and the pro max with battery drain from 5g and 120 hertz displays the iphone 13 pro especially is going to benefit from this boost for those who are not bothered about frame rates and would prefer a longer battery life there's also an option in ios to disable 120 and just run at 60 hertz that being said it's going to be an adaptive refresh rate so i imagine most are going to leave it on 120. but the iphone 13 is shaping up to be the phone we all wanted to see last year we've got improved cameras across the board a smaller notch on the front a 120 hertz display in millimeter wave 5g models are going to be available to more countries the only real uncertainty we have left is touch id i'm still trying to find this one out but with mass production underway if it is happening then someone in the supply chain should provide confirmation soon even without touch id though i'm still very excited for the iphone 13 and i'll be pre-ordering it as soon as i can for everyone that is waiting for the new iphone 13 we're now going to run through the expected specs design and the pricing to help you guys decide if this is the phone for you for my regular viewers you guys have seen this so just skip to the next video but if you're new here then hit subscribe now and we'll get right into it so to start us off with that we've got the entry level model the iphone 13 mini although there were low sales on the predecessor reports suggest that we're still going to see a 13 mini but it may be the last time now the iphone 13 mini is a 5.4 inch phone with an oled super retina display is expected to have a resolution of 2340x1080 and this will give us 465 pixels per inch we only get a 60hz display on the mini but we still get a thinner notch with the cool speaker move to the top with apple continuing to prove that huge amounts of ram are just not required it should be equipped with four gigs of ram and a choice of 64 128 or 256 storage we're expecting another aluminium frame to reduce cost but the body will look similar to that of the pros of course we get the selfie camera on the front and the iphone 13 mini comes with a dual camera setup on the rear this can be a 12 megapixel wide angle and a 12 megapixel ultrawide and the layout has changed slightly with the lenses now diagonal to each other and it will of course ship with ios 15. now for those of you that want the 4 gig ram with 64 gig storage it's likely launching at a price of 700 for 128 gig it's gonna be around 750 and for 256 it will be around 850 dollars now next up we've got the iphone 13. the iphone 13 is going to have a 6.1 inch oled display with a resolution of around 25 32 by 1170 giving us 460 pixels per inch again we only get a 60 hertz display and no ltpo technology but we do get a reduced notch up top we expect four gigs of ram along with a choice of 64 128 or 256 gig storage and the iphone 13 is gonna have an aluminium frame we're expecting a 12 megapixel wide angle and a 12 megapixel ultrawide giving us a dual camera setup and the iphone will of course ship with ios 15. for the 64 gig model it's expected to be 800 for the 128 it's 850 for the 256 it's 949 next up we've got the iphone 13 pro coming with some big improvements over the predecessor the iphone 13 pro is expected to come with a 6.1 inch oled display with a resolution of 25 32 by 1170 and this gives us 460 pixels per inch it's not only going to be brighter but it's also going to be using ltpo technology and provide us with a 120hz variable refresh rate and it's still going to be capable of 120 hertz at its full resolution the a15 is more than capable with ios so we expect them to stay with six gigs of ram and it's going to come with a choice of 128 256 512 and maybe even one terabytes of storage because this is the more premium model we're expecting a steel frame on the iphone 13 pro and of course we're getting a cord camera setup this is going to be a 12 megapixel wide angle a 12 megapixel ultra wide a 12 megapixel telephoto and of course the additional lidar scanner the phone will of course ship with ios 15 when it comes to pricing we expect some small price increases with the new display technology so we're estimating that for 128 gig it's gonna be one thousand and fifty dollars for 256 gig it's gonna be 1150 for 512 it's gonna be 1350 if there is a one terabyte version it's likely to be around fifteen hundred dollars now finally we've got the iphone 13 pro max the iphone 13 pro max is coming with a 6.7 inch oled display with a resolution of 2278 by 1128 giving us 458 pixels per inch again it's going to be a brighter display using ltpo technology and provide us with 120hz variable refresh rate at its full resolution we can expect six gigs of ram a choice of 128 256 and 512 storage and if the leaks are true then we could see one terabyte because this is the most premium model we expect another still frame on the iphone 13 pro max and we're also getting a quad camera setup again it's going to be a 12 megapixel wide angle 12 megapixel ultra wide and a 12 megapixel telephoto along with the additional lidar sensor the phone will of course ship with ios 15 when it comes to pricing we expect some small price increases with the new technology so for 128 gig it's likely to be around one hundred and fifty dollars for 256 it's going to be 1250 for 512 it could be around 1450 and if one terabyte happens we could see something huge like 1 600 so that's it for the whole iphone 13 series the launch is expected to be in september and although there have been many delays across the industry this year reports suggest the iphone 13 is not affected while no date has been confirmed yet it's likely to be the 14th of september so it's not too much longer to wait of course as always i'd like to know your thoughts in the comments who out there is excited for the apple iphone 13 and do you want it to have touch id

created a completely new way to work across your devices with greater precision and speed and we call it universal control i'm putting the finishing touches on an illustration here on my ipad it's the last piece i need to finish a presentation that i have open on my macbook now i'll just set my ipad down next to my mac and check this out without any other setup i'm gonna simply move my mac cursor towards my ipad and the ipad automatically recognizes it and if i move a bit further boom my cursor is now on the ipad how cool is that for our pros out there universal control works with more than two devices so let's add this imac into the mix now i can use the trackpad on my macbook to control my imac as well i can also switch to use my imacs keyboard and mouse and this is so cool watch this now i have a title text image i've been working on here in procreate on my ipad now i'm going to take this image and drag it across all three devices and drop it in to final cut just like that we think using the browser should feel natural and uncluttered so we've reimagined the browsing experience we distilled the toolbar to its essential elements tabs are more compact modern and lightweight and there's a completely new way to use tabs with tab groups they allow you to easily save and manage your tabs without cluttering up your tab bar let's start with safari's gorgeous new tab design all of my tabs are right here in the new streamline tab bar one of the really cool things that we did this year is we built the search field right into the active tab safari is more space efficient than ever and i can see more of the page i can click on the active tab to see the page's full address and then i can search right from here reader is in the tab bar whenever i need it and everything else is right here in the more menu check this out as i switch tabs the tab bar takes on the color of the site that i'm viewing so it feels like a part of the page it looks beautiful tab groups are an easy and lightweight way to save your tabs and pick them back up later i'll open the new redesigned sidebar and i have a few tab groups here already each of these groups is a whole set of tabs i use them for meal planning for news and for gift shopping with ios 15 we have some great new features coming to airpods starting with conversation boost which is designed to help people with mild hearing challenges stay more connected in conversations through computational audio and beamforming microphones conversation boost focuses your airpods pro on the person talking in front of you making it easier to hear and follow along in a face-to-face conversation and to help you hear the conversation even better you can also reduce the amount of ambient noise next we have significantly improved how airpods work in find my with ios 15 you can locate your airpods pro and airpods max using the find my network your airpods simply send out a secure bluetooth beacon that can be detected by other apple devices they can relay your airpods location to the network and then back to your find my app and if they're nearby just choose play sound listen for the chirp whether they're in their case or out and the new proximity view in the find my app lets you know when you're getting close to make it even less likely to lose your air pods you can now receive a separation alert to notify you if you leave your airpods behind with ipad os 15 we're taking this versatility further making ipad even more capable and more intuitive and we started right on the home screen with widgets they offer beautiful glanceable information at just the right moments and this year we have a big update now you can place widgets among the apps on your home screen here i am on the home screen you can see that i already have a few widgets placed along the top let's start by adding a widget i'll bring up the widget gallery here you'll notice some new widgets like the beautiful new find my widget and the contacts widget which helps you reach family and friends with just a tab let's find a good spot for this towards the top here now of course a bigger canvas means more room for widgets so we're adding a new larger format for widgets designed just for ipad's larger display here's the new apple tv widget i can easily dive into my favorite shows with a tab and here's my gaming page and we brought the same ease of multitasking to apps with multiple windows in mail i can touch and hold on this message to open it centered on my screen but i want to save this email and come back to it later so i can just swipe down to minimize it into a new area we're calling the shelf the shelf gives me easy access to all open windows of an app let's go to safari and you'll see that the shelf appears automatically when i switch apps i often have a lot of safari windows open many in split view paired with other apps and now i can just tap to quickly switch between them i can also add or remove windows right here from the shelf we've made the app switcher even more powerful i can now create a split view just by dragging one app over another Buckle up!

of what's coming tomorrow. ♪ Pretty cool stuff, eh? See you along the way. ♪ thanks for bringing us here man this place is uh this place is spectacular this is all same before this is the kind of place that you fly over and you wonder what's going on down there because it's just doesn't you don't feel like there's anything within you know a thousand miles and we find ourselves in this isolated place how did you find why I mean why why I mean why here we recorded the last album in Jackson Hole and I just been looking to get a place but I I've been looking to get a place here and I was looking for multi a multi thousand acre property and Jackson Hole didn't have any properties available over 500 acres because I was looking for a place to set up the easy campus hmm so we found out about Cody we came here and when I first got to the ranch I was expecting something really green because that's what I was used to hmm so I didn't like it when I first got here and there yes but by the time I was it was time to leave I loved it and I was like wow these are actually the easy tones right here it's actually that's true it actually is the palette that I'm thinking about that that makes me kind of want to put the other jacket back on my breath I wanna wear the fleece is good you look good and the fleet just feels like you know it says Jesus is king palette oh yeah that makes it make sense though you talked about and people were at least 10 20 years now it's more of a future well I want to ask you about 20 years from now you talk about yeezy camp what is this place in 20 years I have some visions but the more that I'm in service to God I just clear my head and just wake up more empty every day and then let and let God do the driving and just use me as he may so you you know you make plans and God laughs so if I told you the plans I could tell you what what would happen six months from now at 20 years now so we're we're building farms here because of the climate and because the soil then I have hydroponic cotton we hemp and we're developing our own fabrics who are going to go from seed to sow and farm-to-table so we can see the entire process full sustainability yes which is a concern for all of us but but its present on your mind the idea of a sustainable future we got a sustained right we do yeah and for me I know where it's an interview and we're doing talking but the reason why I didn't want to say 20 years from now I would say six months Naz is it's really not about talking it's about doing mm-hmm so we are doing we are in the process right now I can I could tell you what I'm doing anything else just yeah I got a talk you know I think the original plan was for you to use your interest in architecture and and to build something that that gave to the community and expanded into the community from from Calabasas and that didn't that didn't manifest itself one reason or another permits was that the reason why couldn't happen out in California well it did manifest that I was able to see it get done mm-hmm but you know I was in California building my domes and they said my dome was ten feet too high right then they tore it down that kind of semantic but think about what they're saying mmm your dome it's too high we got to tear it down so they came to me and said you have to tear it down but before I even had the opportunity now Maya this is more my own 300 acre property before I had the opportunity they already went to press with it hmm to be liked and by the way we're gonna show everyone tell everyone that we're tearing down your dough so what did that say to you at the time beyond the actual actually detained feet what does the 10 feet say to you more than anything was the 10 extra seconds that it takes to get a like back when you put something on Instagram that extra waiting time slow yessing people and slowing people down is one of the most popular forms of control how many times have you had an idea and you just get put in traffic through the bureaucracy so I don't deal with the traffic at all on any situation where I'll just be sitting waiting I'm like cuz its power versus force I'm not gonna force anything I do what I have the power to do uh-huh and if I have to force it then it's probably not a situation I need to be in when I come here and I see the kind of world you're living in here and the kind of environment you that you will create six months and Beyond I just wonder what and and the transformation you're going through as a human being what a city like our life feels like when you go back it feels a bit cramped for my mind when you drove here you didn't see a lot of extra noise it was the road there was nothing and then just God yeah yeah I mean when you see all of the the billboards the the traffic billboards and I say traffic I'm talking about the billboards are actually sex trafficking because if a guy is arguing with his girl or something that went through something with his wife and on one side of the street there's a billboard for spirits just alcohol another side it's called this number where it's a picture of a woman on a billboard says come to the strip club yeah and he goes and spend some money just to sit down and have someone to talk to him at the end of the night when they close up the club they say how much traffic did we have so there's all different layers to traffic in like for me playboy was my gateway and to full-on pornography addiction my dad had a playboy left out at age five and it's affected almost every choice I made for the rest of my life mmm from age five to now having to kick the habit and it just presents itself in the open like it's okay and I stand up and say you know it's not okay you must be incredibly aware now that you've got to a point where you are actively turning your back on the coping mechanisms that you've been using throughout your life right in order to function from that moment in time through to when did you first start to acknowledge the idea of being born again and and absorbing your faith Holt like completely not just as a Christian walking through society but actually like in servitude when was that approximately it's like approximately April okay was after Coachella yeah you know yeah God was using me and it lined up amazing like literally the Sunday was Easter Sunday yeah but I remember when the hare died you know it was placed on my head that morning before Coachella and then hit my head and it felt cold hmm and I didn't like it I had an aversion to it and then when the guy was dying it I didn't even like how I came out I had like too much white in the tone it was like purple and white and I was like I don't like this but I had already planned to have like this purple you know outfit and this purple hair dye and you know I wouldn't have the I wouldn't have the time to sit and do anything you know like that now because I'm you know using my mind to build what we're building with farming what we're building we're bringing manufacturing back to the states within the next two years Easy's you know we're gonna bring them back to the states we're creating factories where we have an injection molded shoes we're gonna be hiring people through the prison reform I don't like to say the word system but second-chance people hmm and just you know people gave up on manufacturer um I wanna I'm talking about the purple hair for a second oh but then I want to jump into how we had given up on manufacturing and said let's just like manufacturers overseas because it seemed like it was what was easier yeah and for me as a founder it's really important to bring these jobs you know back to back to America why I mean what specifically what what affected you that that part of the process of building easy offshore let's start creatively I had this idea for a new boot that we did and actually the design that we did is very similar to something that we now just saw in a Balenciaga show so a lot of times me and Tim that the head designer blintz Yaga will have similar ideas thinking we did the 700 they did the triple-s at the similar time so you know I built a factory in Canoga California so we wouldn't have to go to the factories in China but 30% of the machines were still in storage and it was never built all the way to not have to go to China so the team went to China they're working on this boot I call it the motorcycle boot right now and it's stuck in customs so I still haven't seen I said do we have a picture of it or we don't have a picture of it whereas when I have ly this gentleman Caesar that works in our office will have a idea and he's just pulling the phone together and moulding it right there I mean by the end of the day you get a physical idea of what once was a Photoshop so for us to be able to wrap it prototype we have to wrap your prototype even the what we're doing with the way spaces are you know it's like we've been stuck in a loop and we got to break the loop and that's one of the reasons why I took the denim jacket off even though I love the the color and put on this polar fleece because the idea is more in the future than the fabrics we're looking at the fabrics are we gonna use traditional cotton cotton or are we using the polar fleece what impact does the dye have and we're studying if we can control the color from the seed and that's when you go seed to sow because a lot of times you have a separate cotton factory and then they send it out to be cut then it gets sent back to the cotton factory then it gets sent to die and we've been talking about things like screen printing to apply color or dipping it in a different way because we're just looking like nylon is a five-story building so when we're going to see to someone I'm looking because I like the Nile when we have nylon in here I'm saying oh wow we need to we got to have fabrics that don't take five story buildings I was gonna psyche Enoch before we were talking started filming I was talking about how I wanna get your opinion on why it's important to bring manufacturing back to the states I mean I've only been here four or five years but I mean I know that it's important to the country that there are jobs here and that there are things happening in them within the country within the space of the country I mean you know from my point of view I know that there is a huge amount of deliberation over manufacturing and and and conditions and wages and all sorts of things offshore and you know I know from people from talking to people in fashion talking to people in all kinds of industries that there's a desire to control that more to be more in control of how people are treated and how things are made I mean it's really about control we have to be in control of our own minds of our own food our health and our families that's what's gonna say well you know when I arrived I said I didn't know whether this was you know 3000 years with a and 3,000 years in the past or 3,000 years in the future being on this ranch because it's so isolated and and and really are in the elements apart from this cozy environment we're in the elements right here it's just been planted in the middle of the space and and it sounds to me like you want to go back to go forward like you want to go back and use some of these techniques and these ideas in order to roll is dismantle it ultimately here like Rome is the is the true Silicon Valley of humanity a lot of the ideas and things that we need yeah I've been are from thousands and thousands years ago there's like what do we need for our as laws hierarchy of neat art what is mmm what our personal needs as a human being and what we need the most is each other mm-hmm that's why we gather together just like the antelopes that are running out there hmm we gather together and what is the best form of each other family to keep our families close huh but cities have been designed to create more problems that can create more industries so it's designed that your job is 45 minutes away so that you can spend time and traffic so that the cars have more wear and tear and and spend more gas and take more gas but to think of communities where the church is in the center of the community and then then the school cafeterias sustainable gardening and homes this is the concept that I have this is what we this is what me and Rick Fox went to the Bahamas as we're working on hurricane proof homes right now we're thinking of how to organize the amount of wind that's coming through yeah this house is gonna be way more that I put on here you know yeah yeah so I mean this is not a hurricane obviously nobody whips through yeah and one of when I was creating the energy to write I mean that's what he was saying before I mean it's it may the elements give you what you need is what you're saying yeah God gives us everything that we need what I love about being Christian is I've always been an innovator but it always seemed like all the innovators working for I don't know and ran I heard the term or something like these ideas that there is no God all this and it's just working for the valuation of a company as opposed to working for the rebirth or is that a rebirth I might not find the right word but working for a renewal of the planet and a humility and humanity to understand that we will not destroy the earth we could destroy the resources we can destroy ourselves and we destroy ourselves and then the earth goes off sure so regardless of what's happening at Wall Street and what's happening at the board at the you know with with trade and what's happening a Pangaea type mentality un coming together one thing no matter what side you're on you're considered to be a bad guy a good guy everybody wants a similar thing and that's for the world to be better for their children huh so someone's fighting in a war they want the world to be better folks their children and what we're not realizing being all God's creation is we have so much more in common than we think I think there's something planning at us this idea of you know human nature even stuff that I was saying oh I saw in Silicon Valley but this guy was like I don't want the world to be fixed if I if I'm not the one fixing it but you know we do we always put ourselves right right in the center of trying to solve things but I often think that as society we lack direction in the unity needed to do it as one right we don't always have to be the one that does it you know this interview alone yeah might do it I could be in there and you know have these ideas of civil engineering and using aqueducts and sustainable gardening and farming but there's people out there they're gonna see this and they're like they're gonna come to the table and say you know I've done I've studied this for 10 years I've studied this for 10 years I've studied this for 10 years and it's something where everybody all the fortune 500 companies all the founders have to come to the table and say this is what we want we were here in 2012 it's a difference between founders yeah and stockholders yeah what would you say the difference is well the founder has the ultimate responsibility for the legacy at hand the stockholder has the ultimate responsibility for the money and the power and the business of the money in the moment yeah so you got a look look he'd like Gary from Restoration Hardware they try to kick him out of his company yeah and it was as legacy didn't match up with the with the with the with the with the power you know with the the money in the and they had had to bring him back that's the thing with the founder founders are special bro yeah that's living founders yeah you gotta honor those living founders those are the great great-great great-great-grandfather's of what's being built so who are the who are the who are the founders right now that you're speaking to all of them this interview give me a call four years ago we did the same thing but the difference was and this is the fun this is how much you've changed over four years four years ago you did the same thing in turn to the camera and you were like I need I need to find need support to build my vision with easy and I need people to understand my place in fashion my place outside of just making music and I want to be taken seriously and I am and you said give me a call now there's a different is a different mission and that required you to commit whole like wholesale to your faith not just as I am a Christian but also know who my favorite founder is so Jack Dorsey right why just incredibly smart visionary mm-hmm he created a bank on his third company at one company it fell second company's Twitter created Square and now he's got a new arm like st. arm that division the bank that allows people to buy stock in companies as big as I'm gonna say his company I don't know how to say today but it's the one that calls 314,000 Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Jack Dorsey's created an app where someone can buy into that stock at $1 actually I'm not saying that that is not possible somewhere on the stock market huh I'm just saying he created the app and that allows everyone to be invested to be invested I mean that's just one of the things he's did one of the things that he did is he he wanted to invest in me early and he never he never tried to Sun me a lot of times I would go out and meet with people in Silicon Valley and it was really like the first episode of Silicon Valley where Kid Rock is like young love Kid Rock and the very next conversation is yo that's cute right he's the brokest person here so you imagine lies you would trivialize you thought trivialized in that experience as an entertainer trying to play trying to play tick absolutely and you know now that I'm in service to Christ my job is to spread the gospel mm-hmm to let people know what Jesus has done for me you know I've spread it a lot of things I there was a time I was letting you know what high fashion had done for me I was letting you know what the Hennessy had done for me I was letting you know all these things but now I'm letting you know what Jesus has done for me and in that I'm no longer I'm no longer a slave I'm a son now son of God I'm free through to Christ I'm thinking of something I want to say I allow Christian innovator when you think about the church because it has to stand on the word so hard it loves to be extra traditional to the point of blocking innovation so when we started Sunday service we were able to be free where people were in doubt of it and questioned some people slow in question now saying it's not a church you can't call it a church because you'll have a pastor all of these things is it a choice well we have a pastor now so but this is a church like I mean is that is that kind of the ultimate compliment for you that Sunday service is a church well let's ask let's ask North West she thinks we based our design loosely not loosely okay we saw out we saw Rob James Terrell [Laughter] he's a good one yeah so we and I have the utmost respect he's unreal for Ortega also the head is Zara because I would like to saw Raja Rock right I want as I rob their infrastructure right and the way their office environment so the the the church that we did I was you know slightly embarrassed to show James that we had copied his his uh his circular space yeah and it didn't have an oculus at the top so we just copy the way he did the benches right he did some lights but the lights would move slow and sometimes it looked like doesn't make yet yeah so what is your it's like a big sort of like rounded teepee type environment is yeah so I showed you know North a picture of a James Turrell structure that I loved and she said that looks like Church huh that's what church looks like to north and north is you know she was last night just actually crying about when she couldn't go to church when it would be out of town and she'd be at school and she was like church needs to be here every Sunday so now we'll only move the church mostly on Friday have only moved the choir mostly on Friday and throughout the week but we'll always have it at home because church does need to be a place that people know they can go to and they don't have to hop on a flight and chase it down and that's what is a part of what I think makes it a church another thing is when North talks about church she says I'm gonna bring my friends here and I'm gonna dance tell me someone that you know that's in our age group that they're most positive memory of their childhood or one of them equally was going to church where people are like I want to go to church and what do you think that is sitting in those pews the tradition the four walls God doesn't exist only in four walls God is everything and everywhere so Christian innovation Christian innovators that's the net that we're casting for the organization that we have now looking for a Christian innovative Christian Avena wrap up preacher well no longer entertainer I'm not here for anyone's entertained interesting interesting so let me ask you this real quick cuz I because I want to go here for a minute yeah North's all in you're raising your family with in this environment now and they support you and they Bend and they're believing Kim as well yes right so what about like say you're making this album what about those who are talented who bring something special to the table who are creative who inspire you in that regard but not necessarily worshipping at the altar how's your relationship with them changed because you're so driven by your faith now they're still here mm-hmm I believe that was King David now I'm not a theologian I'm a recent convert so I just wanted to say that before I start sure quoting or misquoting structure so yeah yeah you're on a journey yes so yeah that was this journey of this album you know there was times where I was asking people to fast during the album I was asking people to this is gonna be radical when I'm about to say I know this is we can look at it edit this time was where I was asking people to now have premarital sex while they were working on an album huh I know that's one with a shady room we like what you mean don't have premarital sex you better turn that Magda style you know right now so that but seriously there's time so I was you know this time so I went to people that were working on other projects and said could you just work and focus on this and not just because you needed their attention but because it wasn't in keeping with the spirit of what you were making you thought that it was at odds what they were working on yeah I thought it would be it would tarnish the experience yeah I thought if we could all focus and fast I mean it's known when people pray together families are pray together stay together when people pray together and fast together the the power is is increased so so I had some things were theories of recent converts they go in and you know we're a lot of times the most fire-and-brimstone else judgmental yeah because we don't know what - we don't everything that we did was of and that for God so we have to the reaction to a degree isn't it it's a reaction of what you've left behind so ya feel like you must commit 1000% to something in order to leave behind that was the environment you can't tell other people that are around that they need to be committed 1,000% and that's the thing but God was patient and my family was patient for me when they when they were praying for me you know when they saw me yeah at the pornhub Awards there's family members they couldn't tell me not to do it all they could do was pray yeah and be patient and it had to happen in God's time so for me when I have people around who I would like them to be where I'm at in my journey this time so all I could do is pray and be patient guys gonna only be in God's time but you've lived a well-documented life filled with temptation and it's been it's all throughout your records and all throughout your music and it's been quoted and what's your relationship with temptation now how do you process that are you able once you find God to the degree you have to just switch that off is that possible I think when people have been addicted to something like if you ask somebody that's a drug addict it's like you say are you still addicted well yeah you turn it off actually like with God I've been able to beat things that had a full control of me things that you know that that played way that I found when I was five years old was written all over the moment when I was at the MTV Awards with the timberlands the ball mine jeans before people's rocket ball my jeans and the Hennessy bottle it's like that was such a script out of a rock star's life my mom had passed a year before and I said you know some people drown themselves in drugs and I drowned myself in my addiction mmm which was what sex and that's what drove the ego to fit the ego I mean that was part of feeding the ego money clothes cars accolades the advent of social media a Twitter account mm-hmm of paparazzi photos go on to Paris Fashion Week all of that it's overwhelming I mean we need to clear your mind to the degree you are now and you sit out here in Wyoming making music which is spiritually fulfilling to you and hopefully to millions of other people you know what that was not just addicted to sex I was also addicted to inspiration but there's only one you know I was thank God they both serving the same purpose to some degree and I mean this let me let me qualify that statement okay addiction be it six drugs alcohol is a coping mechanism that is designed to fill a space in you that can't be filled an insatiable hole right requiring more and more isn't use it inspiration maybe I'm meaning more ambition isn't that doing the same thing then well they said that you know a lot of successful men had a high sex drive right the who said that you know they yeah yeah so but when I meant by addicted to inspiration yeah it could be the sex could be an inspiration but also just a design image you know a jacket that I wanted to design a car image a house image I was addicted to these kind of images coming across like be people say our architecture is my porn hmm and people can be addicted to architecture mm-hmm people I mean a big big addiction is work yeah very much workaholics let's call him and what about you know men that say men and women that say hey you know I'm working this job so hard to make a better life for my kids and then you look up and they hadn't spent their life when you exactly when do you live your life with your actual kids we do you find that balance you see I'm we're gonna make a better life of my kids but when are you gonna spend your life with your kids yeah and really it's it like did you have to work for that fourth house you know did you have to work for the well did you I didn't have to there's a balance of family and calling that I specifically have I have to protect and take care of my family and make sure what the power that God has put in my hands that I do everything that I can as the father to provide the best chance at them being the maximum success that they can be no that was a very but specifically thoughtful answer yeah because I just say normal life no I just say no I was very jealous oh oh and I get that I and I said as a father because they also have a mother that's right so it's the barrel and it's all about the fourth house it's about the environment that you create ultimately they're learning right yeah and also the environment of because of my position in the world the environment that I inform for other people you know we've informed a successful celebrity marriage a successful interracial marriage where the husband was the darker color inside of America we we've informed some things that I I wasn't as into now where you know I literally was up there trying to have my daughter out dress Rihanna it sound crazy when you say it out loud but if you really think about is like his daughter was walking around with a slip dress I the culture was my god mm-hmm because and this was documented this was documented in Keeping Up with the Kardashians and in a scene really interesting to watch the dynamic of you and Kim where she ultimately said you were complicit in this experience yeah and now you're asking me to change and away from the cameras that's that's another example of what you're talking about is not I would I always had a bit of a version of paparazzi which has been documented I'm also and have also had a aversion to cameras being on at all times there's a balance of when we have to be closed on Sunday but the idea I was gonna say is that I thought I was the God of culture but really culture was my god and who invented the culture the culture is cultivated by who so if you were to think what is the culture today what are some of the major things that it includes and all of the major points of what might make the culture the culture bowing I mean taking a knee at a football game wearing you know expensive clothes rapping about just rap period making money from rap making money from basketball before I get to my point can we name some other things that you say are part of culture buying jewelry what are some of the other things that we see on the culture using social media as a very major part of the culture to be down with or with the culture you have to use social media right what other things okay now let me just get to my point right now none of these things that you need to be involved in in order to be down with the culture are owned by by people so who designed the culture a lot of people would argue that you are instrumental in driving the culture and you own your own companies that you have inspired that change what it's an inspired now but did you know that this is where I was going with it when I named all those things you didn't name yourself you didn't name yourself and yeah it's a very valid point mm-hmm I think that's changing I think that culture is very squarely going into the hands and the influence now of the mute the new founders I mean when Chad said don't sign anything right his tour was canceled like the next week mm-hmm spiritual warfare okay let's talk about that you say it and God is changing God is using me God is using me to show off I believe he like you know God is is similar to he's saying he wanted the loudest voice and the and the the one who made the most noise timid to make the most impact yeah he wanted to show off he's like Matt now let me take this let me take this never kanessa type character Nebuchadnezzar was the king was it is it Babylon mm-hmm not Nebuchadnezzar was the king of Babylon and he looked at his entire kingdom and said I did this and God said Oh real you did this it sounds kind of similar right I'm standing on the tip of the mountain talking about Jesus say it's right I did this I'm a god now I'm a God and I could talk to Jesus at the end of my show I had a guy dressed up as Jesus at the end of my show standing on a huge mountain yeah that's all and that huge mountain first why they make any money off the tour I'm lugging a mountain around and God said okay never kanessa was diagnosed with bipolar disorder he was and he was still King so not only was I diagnosed with mental illness the mental illness is something that was used to take my dome down by 10 feet to wash me out to control me let me tell you one are you saying that they tore it down because it was based on the fact that they consider what you were doing to be part of to be crazy no that's not what I'm saying but I see that you took in that way no I was just comparing on my dome and saying this guy that can go up to the telethon this guy that that we can cancel him off a radio and still 20,000 kids come to see him and he is completely not played by the rules of the system and still the most relevant we could take him off the time cover we could do no covers on them on purpose on purpose we could just take away press no publicist Vic do that and he still has the number one searched brand on the planet meaning like number one GZ number two or flight number three adidas and then the other three is like Adidas Nike and Louie Vuitton I don't know which one was which one was which but the number one was easy and all the other ones I'm closely associated with in some way every one of these guys that our founders now have to look me I to I every founder on the planet there will be a time while will be president of the United States and I will remember I will forgive but I will remember any founder that didn't have the capacity to understand culturally what we were doing interesting tone though like I will forgive and I will remember is kind of like it's sort of like a forgiving threatening hybrid what Oh what I'm supposed to forget no you said you'll forgive but what does remember mean if you forgive isn't forgiveness if you forgive yourself for the life you lived up until six seven months ago do you still remember all the things you always remember every meeting and interaction I've had with Jack Dorsey and I will always remember my meetings and interactions with Mark Zuckerberg and they've been completely different mm-hm with social media people are brainwashed by a people are addicted to it is they modern-day cigarettes when cigarettes first came out and Edward Bernays created the created the torches of freedom March to get women to feel empowered yep by smoking cigarettes this is from center yourself and it shows that Edward Bernays was Freud's cousin so you know I don't know if I should even even talk anymore it's like you gotta leave I mean so much more to ask you I just thought the waving is so much more now see it might be five more years where I get it you might be president by the time I speak to you next yeah we're I'm gonna be on the on the on the picking order when you're president you are you write down no we'll do our interview we'll do an interview I don't do a lot of interviews anyway you Donna's gonna see you again I'll probably do more interviews when I'm president 2024 is still thing it's still that's the that's the timeframe we're working on you're working on some things right now so yeah the what I'm saying is people are addicted to social media people invest more into a photo on social media than they invest into real life one of the reasons why I came to this ranch is to get outside anyone that's in a corporate environment black or white there's bureaucracy at every level there's there there's rivalries on teams at every level there's rivalries with coaches with owners with stockholders with founders and everybody goes home to their families and they want their their sons and their daughters to be a successful as them if not better you know we're all people yeah so this is it to to point fingers and say this person is doing good and this person is doing bad you know I'm just giving you a flat opinion on what I currently see and what I feel and the pain that I have in my life I suffer I suffer and I appreciate the suffering because it's just we can just feel a little bit of what Jesus felt when we suffer but social media makes me suffer I suffer from that and by me saying this out loud I'm sure that there's other married men that suffer in a similar way that are happy to hear me say oh yeah I'm suffering well I just married men because social media prompts women in particular to put out content that they wouldn't have put out when I sent referring to your sex addiction yeah would not yeah it definitely could deal with my addictions but when I was younger and I wanted to see something like that I had to you know pay someone that was older to go to 7-eleven and buy it now I got friends they got have kids that aren't just out of grandmas school in high school that it's completely available there is no NSFW I'll load up right now on this computer and I'll load up some things and you'll be like should that be NSFW or not is it just covering just a bit of it and you know there's people as a god-fearing merry Christian innovator billionaire founder no one's gonna take my opinion away from me I've been given my opinion my whole career I didn't kill my career how many times I'm gonna start giving my opinion now people are not any times people talking my career is over mm-hmm no one is going to control my opinion and one of the things where people have been off let off the hook a bit was this whole oh he's crazy I look at him he's crazy that got to mute my opinion for 3-4 years but it's God has the power jesus is the force that brought the sanity back let me tell you how I brought some sad back by following God when you are no boo can you not be on social media literally as we speak just something else like this either like focus the energy here or like go somewhere else and like go just do it in another room but something but I'm not trying to put your butt so just saying that I'm like that I know but I go into this transcendent state in this day that he was come where like oh I'm actually reading Larry's mind what's Larry think as you're speaking I'm actually reading Josh's mind I'm reading mr. Boies mine but what happened exactly case in point something on the internet took oh distracted booze - what we're talking about when people pray together and you're in a room together you can think things all the way through when that energy builds up because artists are like a lake we reflect what's in front of us so if you're in front of an audience in the audience is wider you might say everybody throw your hands in the air yeah that wouldn't be appropriate if you like came in as one person sitting at the breakfast table you like everybody thought yeah I'm just one person what I'm saying is you're a reflection of in a room that you're in where you are yeah you're absorbing and absorbing that energy try to translate that energy and create something great yeah you know I want actually that brings something to mind when I saw the Pablo tour with the stage and I watched the way that people moved under it it felt like a worship and it felt the reaction felt like like icon an idol worship it didn't feel like it like a normal show and I wonder now that you're putting your energy into something channeling it into something bigger than you how hard that is looking back on it with some hindsight just reflect for a minute how hard it is being on a stage when all that energy is coming at you and you didn't have a place to channel it like faith you you exactly this exact point I was making when you're not serving God you're serving everyone else you're serving your ego you're serving your bank account you're serving your legs see you're you know serving your wife and kids yes is a good thing sir you're serving your management or the people that you're managing you're serving you serve a Hollywood you're serving your reputation you're serving the the responsibility of your race you're serving you know there's a so the thing is I am you'd say with what I do with music that I am a a top chef be like of five stars Michelin chef correct of what I do with music right so imagine that level of chef having to serve at ten different restaurants all at the same time right and drive different places those meals sounds like a road to bankruptcy a road to bankruptcy a road to TMZ quotes a road to the world just not understand any holding out with your friends yeah a falling out with your friends and people just not understanding the main thing is look we are living in the dark ages we're living in an age where people die of hunger we're living in an age where people are being killed in the street by their own race we're living in an age where one in three african-americans are being locked up we're living at age where there are children being held at the border some with their real present parents some not with their real parents we were living at age where houses are not sustaining through hurricanes and there's companies that are worth trillions of dollars around the world with geniuses just working on how to make solely their product better we're living at age where someone could be fired for what they think if they say it out loud that's the age wake up this is 2019 this is where we are at right now this is what Dave Chappelle whole point was stop chilling the art the artists are supposed to express themselves to be able to have that eternal three-year-old at all costs people say oh this is going to kill your brand but my brand is expressing how I feel whether it's in line with what you thought the brand was even two days ago a smart man has the to pivot and say I think something different now I don't think this because this was the culture I don't think North should wear crop tops just because I had a way in a slip dress when she was 2 years old I think and feel differently now now that I am Christian now that I'm the founder of a 3 billion dollar organization and married for five years I have five years of marriage under my belt now tell me who you gonna listen to what have you learned from five years of marriage what do you learn from that what I learned from five years of marriage is it is the greatest bond it is a god bond to be able to have someone that you can call along someone you could call out someone that could call on you and call you out equally yoked someone to complain to and someone to grow with as we grow and raise our children that sounds like real commitment like I'm not just saying like ten years of marriage but that sounds like a life long realization those are all key attributes to a lifelong bond absolutely that's it I mean I told my wife I said Jesus King is coming there's gonna be a lot of attacks there's gonna be some silly attacks what do you say that are you talking about spiritual spiritual attacks just spiritual warfare and then also just societal control attacks and I was afraid to speak my mind when I was when I didn't know my Master's all my Master's you think I ain't gonna talk my mind right now uh-huh you know saying this give me some other examples where someone is saying something that isn't what you're culturally supposed to say hmm give me an example of something of a position where someone is saying something that you're not culturally supposed to say we there I bet it's only one name you could think of you don't want to say it did you live by the way I'm alright with that say that name Donald Trump's on the list no doubt about it and I and I don't I'm not a fan man oh and that's that that's an understatement right but that's okay we're different we and we have different approaches now we live our life but one thing you said earlier on which I do totally relate to which I love is we're trying to leave the world a better place for the people who have mattered to us how kids okay and if you're too young to have kids you're trying to make the world a better place for yourself and she may be in a situation where it's expected of her now but I do think Greta Thun Berg at one point was on their list having a 16 year old kid from Sweden coming out and putting everything on hold and saying what she believed in and climate change does consume me and I do think it's an issue and I think the fact that she came out did that was huge and now it's like oh that's culturally accepted cuz she has an army of kids behind it but at the time she was one kid she's the only person who stood out in the street and did that mmm on her own do you how many times I've walked down the street when I'd been so frustrated about that and thought what if I just stop what I'm doing is stand out in the middle of a street in Los Angeles with the placard would anyone join me right I'm sure I'm not alone of feeling that way and if it was overwhelming like what changes are really gonna make she just showed us up she did that on her own started with one person no I was beautiful and it's beautiful but it's also terrifying that we're leaving that world you know I see why you're here I get it I understand why you why you're checking out it was too noisy for you there it was too noisy and he responded by making as much noise as you could and we're lucky we got amazing art out of it amazing art if this was a trade Kanye we did all right out of it you know what there's a funny facts well that's good but also I own nobody nothing my forefathers have already fought the fight so it's not a fight when I put the Hat on it's simply my opinion it's next subject fair enough fair enough you know there is part of you that is liberal I'm the most liberal you forgot your liberals the Liberals like it's like they're gonna come flying down the mountain here in Wyoming like on horses and stuff it's like you know come on but it wouldn't come to my home and they'd rather be with no self service and you know and the valley just driving to like all right our eighth meeting a day all right I'm a Kanye West fan and I'm a can have a cut it's a reality I'm a Kanye West man what you play me of roses a that was shocking for a Kanye West fan but this shows you that God is hilarious why God you know there's one gate there's two gates over the street gates but there's two main gates when you're with houses at the end of the cul-de-sac hmm one gate goes in my house is at the end of the cul-de-sac who else house you think is at the end of the other cul-de-sac of the gate the name of the gate is their house at the end of the cul-de-sac the name of the gate is my house is in the coset what other rapper do you think I don't know help me out I'm trying to wake up okay hold a second okay go so God is funny yeah Drake right literally lives four blocks down the street forgot II gotta go so that shows you that God is likes got a sense of humor thing why Lucas he's the polar opposite of way of where you're at no no it's just because there was a rivalry oh right right right right now liberals love art right and now I am unquestionably undoubtedly the greatest human artists of all time it's just not even a question anymore at this point it's just a fact right so for the greatest artists in human existence to put a red hat on was like God practical joke right it hurts so much it hurts so many it hurt people a lot you know because you are held up as this person who continues to provide us but though but those little those liberals never know fans man fans fan or also fans fans and liberals never stood in front of the prison's to stop their from being one and three locked up or the system that set up with is actually not enough legal job opportunities yeah for us to avoid from being locked up now you got the Clintons that's privately-owned prisons you got I'm saying it's like everyone everyone no one is God everyone bases their opinions on a group of propaganda esque images fed to us from the very first cartoon or the very first cereal box that we saw in a grocery store and our environment friends schools religion country music rebel Institute all informs our opinion and what side were all we've been herded into an idea of blue or red right left but there's actually a time when we were closer to heaven when we were six months before we could learn before we learn how to be before things got so complement so so complicated what we actually had more in common all of these things that separate us it's like when you don't spend time talking to somebody for a long time you start to build up more and more and more and more and more reasons yeah you should be this anxiety in it and that distance creates that anxiety this distance is created anxiety we we are the same human beings we are God's and that man versus machine is man is the machine so if you wants imperfect creation because we perish go ahead so if you're in a situation now where you're able to do you want to mend that you want to bring those things together starting with the relationships in your life are you able to do that with the with the friendships that have been a bit of deviate you talk about the rivalry would drag you talk about this public fallout with people who you've shared a really valuable part of your life with jay-z people like that are you able to men that is this putting you on a path of recovery and personal relationships as much as it isn't your own relationship absolutely you cannot be in service to God and be mad at your brother have you started that process next door yeah I go to Drake's house just I walk over there with no security and just leave my phone number here's my cell but I you know I'm not trying to ring the doorbell and say all you gotta you gotta come out sorry I he might be busy mm-hmm you know he's he got a studio in there you know you probably you know you're just gonna take it the Drake is recording at all times and stuff like me he probably record now man we got leave probably record but you would like to see that you'd like to see that yo yo yo man can I talk here in a booth always never you never ever smile stay in a booth I don't lead a booth speaking at a booth I put my bedroom in the booth for just sleeping a booth I'll sleep in the booth a babe I wake up I bought for breakfast yes so so I'll go leave myself and things like that you know psyche you know with J you know I love all of these people but you got to know there's a there's a lineage of JT a to Drake it's you know this person is your idol then you get to know him then you be friends then you turn to frenemies then you turn the enemies and then you gotta bring back the positive energy mm-hmm but that is the lineage of like rap Kings you know and inspire us cuz J was my biggest you know it's right time I got to New York we had to throw backs I'm gonna tell you I'm really a big boy had to throw backs first and the what was it it's called sky high I think he had the Astros and then he had another one I think you might have had in the watch for the hook video he might add it but Mitchell has had a little stand and Lennox and I would be going down there doing beats for Jermaine Dupri now pull it up to the stand and try to throw back we started getting a lot of throw backs and I pull up to you know baselines and they were like you know I pull up with my throw back and like Jays like man that's nice not like that then I pull up the next I got another throw back there for days they said what you're staying Ilana and then Darcy was using this thing that we that we hadn't heard of called the internet selling jerseys you know online and he'd been had a store like RSVP it's crazy that was like it think about think about that for a second think about like that probably feels like a drop in the ocean right yeah how innocent that time was back then yeah who you were back then versus who you are now hmm and the journey you've been on to get to this place that's a life what happens to all the work what happens to all the music what happens to the songs that we still love what happens to those yah kalisto sure what happens to go is from your perspective right thank you for that and we will but what happens to those I'm going back y'all about to get the George Lucas versions right autumn robots is gonna be like yes such a lovely God right I mean the old clips there's a church in the wild yes yes literally literally reversibly yes do you go got to get the new version yeah they get those old versions we are removing Jesus's wife from the eye that's a huh I went to the Vatican and it was a Raphael painting and the person said this blacked out part is where Raphael painted Jesus wife and the Pope was so mad that he sent people to kill him in Raphael died of a cold before they could kill her mm-hmm and that was when I was saying about when they wanted to tear the domes down I was like I was gonna tear it down before y'all hmm like there's no win in that but I was gonna tear down cuz I was just experimenting anyway they think they you know I'm saying he did something they think la oh man we made you tell ya I was experiment with them domes anyway yeah we just trying to get we're just getting proportions we're seeing what it felt like we took the domes up and we may eat there and we started having you know things like you want some 3,000 years old era you'd say I was 3,000 years ago we stepped into how proprietary can you be in an environment where you serve the Lord and I want to bring up a specific example this this idea of that is such a good question this idea of trademarking Sunday service which ultimately is a terming have created an environment which is communal and belongs to everyone isn't just a Kanye West Show but there's the idea of like ownership over that term how does proprietary behavior exist in a time of ultimate servitude it isn't everything is for a god and we can receive donations mmm that's the only way that it can work so that's so the money you make from the merch is is in donation to the cause I mean I would say some you know spent if if tithing is 20 if tithing is 10 percent Sunday services devta called me 20 percent at this time but that mean sure let me just uh so let me let me make sure but it's the iteration where we haven't completely solved it so we're praying on it we're praying for the answer mmm in God's time for me to be able to work only for the church that you wanna save my 20-year vision that's my 20-year vision everything that I do is for the church even designing a shoe for the church even all the two names all shoe names be like John 3:16 instead 350s now everything is for now everything is for the church that's a vision that I that I have to be able to be an innovator and Christian innovator Christian innovator think about this you know it's a lotta a lot of organizations have capitalized on my creativity and innovation so if everything is for the church and that includes the edit the relationship with your fans let me ask you this what is the relationship between a Kanye West fan and somebody who ultimately is following the same path as you and is there a desire is there a desire ultimately to convert-- to convert-- to convert-- people through this process it's not a desire it's my only mission and calling is to spread the gospel when I make a song is to spread the gospel when we make a device this portable stem player that we design with teenage engineering for this album and albums move forward is to spread the gospel this the ranch any wrench that we use the ideas of behind it to shred the gospel to show everything that I do and to be more respectful to my body as a temple yeah you know even like you know I had I was thinking all you know just using my mind and running this company was good enough no I need to hmm you know watch my diet a happy ending what changes anything I didn't order that frozen margarita today at UH at lunch do you drink it all you know what I had stopped drinking completely when when I first converted and now I'll have a drink it's just mm-hmm what I what I've been told is to not have drunkenness something because I was thinking man it's just the taste of alcohol a sin to taste the alcohol on your lips just I'm trying to work out like like when you've come for okay so check it out so if this if if becoming a born-again Christian is an ultimate reflection upon life before as being sin right not everything in life was sin but when you first become born-again that's what you have to address you have to take a look at the whole picture and and almost untangle it from that work backwards from that right like what is a sin and what is not that's a that's an intense experience we're only yes and then you figure out that you still sin I started giving myself to curses a day Oh like there's a video game like wow oh this is now people say you know God doesn't have a scorecard I gave myself a Christian scorecard yeah and I'd like today yeah I was like I hit an 80 yeah oh yeah 90 I hit a 90 and at certain times I get on the phone with somebody about Manny about the lower my Christian scorecard like it already because you're trying it because you're trying to be the best Christian you can be from day one you always want to be but I mean like you know what I'm having I'm trying to wake this technology out myself but you've always been a Christian but you've made a complete complete commitment so it's all or nothing from day one and then you have to work in what is appropriate from that point forward but it's it's never all or nothing because you you're a human being right right right yes I guess I'm getting a are you allowing use are you being kind to yourself through this process are you allowing fell ability in this process yeah but then I be repenting because I'll you know going like look at some I'm a supposed to be looking out on the internet right and how do you process that now guilt and then this route is I'm not saying oh no no no shame now that's something that Christ has removed is the shame what happened is it's it doesn't work like Karma God is so merciful that it's not directly connected so this is a thought in my mind it's incorrect and quite arrogant to think that God would immediately punish me for me knowingly falling short the ego talking again yes the ego talking but I give you I just give you an example of it you know see if I slip up and look at something pornographic online and then the next day I get into a big argument with my wife or or some of the designs don't come back right at the office or a song we lose a foul or something someone else show up to the studio you know this is incorrect but this ego and arrogance has me thinking oh it's because I did that thing right and then I installation yeah I try to correlate it but that's not God God doesn't work like that and we we don't know how God works but I'll go and be repeated I'm sorry for those nuts that interracial I thought is the most like me about why you've got fences here but how far do you walk how far you let yourself go into this artists do like a 30 40 minute walk you could go for days bro don't ever get tempted to do that don't you ever get tempted to just like if you want to go back like just see what it would be like to just walk it walk off into the distance you own it all yes it's just for hours now used to get other stuff on my schedule but isn't that what you like to like these liberals we're running around trying to do what we can to help the world and but it got this ultimately a process you'd be trying to slow things down and find space to do that to give you some space to think have you been able to do that yes switch off like that yeah well you know the most space that I had to think is when I went to the hospital yeah in 2016 yeah I'm not sure if the wind picked it up but I asked you I said to you do you ever just take the time to walk your land and just think and surely do it to a some degree you bought this place and you you've redesigned your approach to living and in order to find space to think and you scuse me and you said I'm one of the only places that what the place we thought you really got to think was in hospital in 2016 and I wonder that's where I had the most space mmm to think what came from that experience on you know in terms of the processing one of the things that was written we have the booklets that I were right one of the things that I wrote down was build a church in Calabasas so we were at Sunday service and we were doing a set adrift from memory bliss of you mm-hmm no I would die without him now I would I'd you and um my wife showed me where I have wrote sample p.m. dawn die without you so one of the things that happened when I went to the hospital as I started reading the Bible and I started writing out copying and writing out Bible verses and a person came to my house that wasn't a Christian and told me come over and then 30 minutes later I was in handcuffs headed to the hospital now this person very well may have saved my life because when you're in an episode you can jump off the side of a balcony you can stab your high presence of mind is not yeah you could do a lot of things when you're ramped up like that but one of the things that people do now is they try to discriminate against my mind and my thoughts because of that moment it's like if someone you know went to jail and now they're working at an office and they have an argument with somebody who are they gonna blame for the argument the guy that went to jail so I still have radical thoughts visions future ideas and sometimes when I say them out loud people could just denounce it and say oh you're crazy no and I think about I don't buy that because it's someone who has it suffered with mental health issues throughout my life hmm and you know had to really develop tools in order to do them to protect my family because I can definitely find myself in a very very dark place I'm grateful for those experiences in those thoughts oh absolutely to be able to have gone that far to go to places that people say only ayahuasca and different things can take you but to naturally be able to think that far and connect and the way you know I feel another thing related to me wearing the Hat that liberals love to do is say all this relates to mental health his story is meant to help is he like my wife or go places and people will be like it's J okay is he doing is he okay like Kobe Bryant has won five championships and he's got a lot of injuries is his story isn't pulling an Achilles and every story after that how he pulled an Achilles but the same press that doesn't want to do the press and doesn't want to say hey easy is the most Google brand and this guy is a billionaire this guy is a black Trump supporter this guy is they want to make the conversation always be about mental health and I do love the fact that I can show the world that I'm sitting here and have been diagnosed put on medication medication to make me fat on purpose because after I didn't want to take the meds they're like okay we got this version I don't make you fat they're trying to kill the superhero so I'm here to show that someone that's diagnosed can still drive and be the founder of a multi-billion dollar organization can still be in service to Christ can still be a good husband and a good dad my life does not end with this diagnosis no and I will not be stigmatized I'm gonna say one thing and discriminated no I'm sorry I'm say wonder from my perspective I've said this in public too actually isn't private too many my friends you know when I heard the kids he goes project in particular that project was one of the first things that I'd heard that not only remove the stigma of having mental health issues but like you said put a cape on it mmm-hmm gave it a power I think we're the mint where people get confused and align it with mental instability as is if I may say as the distribution of the information oh you may like when I tweet a hundred tweets or when you go off and you do it all in two weeks and everyone sees this flurry of activity and it's like everyday there's three things coming at you that you're distributing information wise then people I think their natural instincts if I can speak for people are to go is he okay there seems to be a lot of disruption and instability going on around him in this very short window of time does that make sense yeah but I've never been just okay I've always been amazing so they want me to operate in a just-okay format mmm and that's not the format that I'm in it and I mean the biggest it's always the defense you just said it's okay but it's not okay it's amazing HSP highly sensitive people meaning people who can't stand the BS I can't sit with something on my spirit for more than a day I can't go to sleep on it I got I have to express it the what when I was you know me and Drake had a disagreement and he refused to talk to me for six months that was so painful because expressing yourself as a form of therapy for people with mental health so you saw I expressed myself I've been waiting to express myself for a long time and then the expression fully came out people that are locked up a lot of times ran out of words the expression went to I'm just about to go shoot somebody or I'm I'm going crazy because I don't have a way to feed my family or my gang said that I'm disrespected and if I don't go and kill this person then they gonna look at me like I'm not strong so it's a lot of things with people are driven to not have a conversation all the way through another thing I was thinking about when I use the bathroom over the day well I take it early just now although I was taking a piss because it pissed me off is when the media says Kanye defends his support of Trump I didn't know I was in a courtroom I got to defend nothing it's not a defense you know if every time someone asks you a question you try to say the right answer your entire life is a test and when did you have the most anxiety in grammar school of high school no request on test day so your entire life become this test I ain't trying to say the right answer I am just doing what I feel my mama said trying is failing there is no ifs Woods could shut it just is and we just are and it is so it's simple that's like and this mentality should not be defeated yay cannot die yay cannot be buried there is nothing there a matter of fact no enemy there is I my only only the enemy is a concept this out it's like a game think about it you play a video game there's an antagonist but it wouldn't be a game unless there was opposition I ain't trying to play ping pong by myself hmm so they set up new goals where there's one time we was like okay Drake is your rival now I think I think more about Bernard Arnault than I think about Drake because he might have thought he got culture by taking Virgil but it's like no now you're having a pilfer from my territory you came in and took one person that is african-american is African and that could be the face to draw Louis Vuitton on the side of backs and get people that look at Instagram and want to buy expensive items that are of the culture so to say to over spin on things all no actually stepped into my territory how'd that make you feel initially when that happen at the beginning not when you hugged each other at you know at the Fashion Show which was one of the best things ever that year that moment at the moment when he left and that happened how did you feel you know I felt bad I felt like it was supposed to be me I was the Louis Vuitton da people still call me the Louis Vuitton Don when I'm walking down the street but I took a branding from something that someone else had made up and is in control of it was completely up to Bernard who he wanted to dawn as the Louis Vuitton Don because he bought the bag brand he went in hired Marc Jacobs he created the industry he innovated the industry of luxury brought people out to fashion shows and pair of Paris I mean Bernardo is one of my heroes he's probably my top my dad is my top living hero and then like way way under that is but not enough because he's got the taste he's got the Sensibility he's got the high Manus man created the idea of even wanting Louis Vuitton it was just an old bag brand and he bought it and then he had the wherewithal to get this kid out of New York Marc Jacobs to go in and wrap it and bring it to the streets with Sprouse me and Pharrell and let him go Wow you know let Kim Jones do the supreme and now hire Virgil like I really admire what Bernard has done he also offered me a deal five years ago when we had our first gz show shook my hand said we never go back on a handshake then drop the deal three months later and it had effect on me going to the hospital mmm-hmm because my first adidas collection that has like these pants from season one had line ups the second collection never came out because I had to dignify the apparel with adidas so no adidas no Louie Vuitton mm-hmm and for me with I'm wrapping Drake stay right down the street I'm designing I don't have production I haven't done it before no one wants to help me out I'm tweeting by season 3 season 4 the show was 45 minutes late and they LeBron to me meaning like they did what they did to LeBron when he said he's going to the heat my wife got robbed in Paris and our control yeah next thing you know I'm in the hospital and I have to wear that for the rest of my life but to take a bat as a badge of honor because it's a don't treat me like a celebrity always know your human being first yes one one 100% and then out of anybody that they could have chose no one they did that they got one of the best men from our wedding mm-hmm and what I love about when I hugged Virgil is he he showed me that actually we're all playing on the same court and he went and ran that field goal he ran that touchdown in for us all because there was a time when we all were crazy there's a time when it was fish sticks and South Park now everybody want to pull up at a fashion show but he really stamped it by being that designer he validated it he validated and when I said earlier I always thought it was supposed to be me it always was and is supposed to be me but I'm not supposed to be working for Bernard mmm I'm supposed to be bringing manufacturing you know back to America they did me a favor but I tell you what now Bernard knows my new Drake I'll tell you that I ain't even thinking I mean I want all blessings Drake up I'm ordained minister if you want meat it like when he finally get married I was like Aubrey I'm gonna have ups and downs you be good that should be good at that yes yes sorry I give it and everything like that I if we didn't get the memo I'm just now I'm not good at holding my breath holding my tongue real bad at it real bad the uh yeah but it was supposed to be me in that way but God had a bigger plan this is that thing is so much the Instagram the Jesus Instagram where the little kid is holding on to a little teddy bear there's an Instagram where a little kid is holding on to a little teddy bear and Jesus has this huge teddy bear behind his back but you don't want to let go of that little teddy bear that you've known your whole life that's what I was talking about to tradition you don't want to let go of what you think it's supposed to be and there's God's got a bigger plan for you that's why I didn't want to even be you know presumptuous and arrogant like borderline blasphemous to try to tell you where this would be in 20 years mmm you know I'm open hey God use me please please Jesus Christ use me to the maximum if it is in your will he's given me all these skills like it's time so I sat in my house and I'm looking at how beautiful my house is and me a taxable vort did it and I'm looking at the designs I'm looking the museum looking at what we do with show design like the floating stage and the mountain hmm and I'm thinking why God why couldn't I work for Bernard oh no and God is like because I need you to work for me this is what sway was talking about and now I used to say how sway now I can say now sway now sway now it's time that's what this is all about yes we're gonna like well you could've gave me to interview this way I love you old respect I know I'm a fan of my peers but it's been five years waiting to get to talk to you again and I think about it and I think about you being forty two million dollars in debt when we spoke the first well it wasn't the first time you know the first time we ever spoke was way before that I asked you what no I was memorable for you but not for me well I remember it and I really so so I'll hold on to that name that's all right conversations come the most memorable question I asked you the first interviewee ever did was which beat do you wish he night do you want your answer was Benjamin's it was because of the question it was Quebec just remember you know it wasn't cuz you asked me it was because no it's because I asked it then we found ourselves for him you found yourself way to million dollars in debt you were screaming at people to notice you and to give you into and to back you show some faith yeah I'm saying Mark Zuckerberg looking for aliens hey go one right here yeah yeah and now you are in this and you're in the cover of Forbes they neglected to mention it be you are a billionaire what I made up the term sent to millionaire they may have a special turn it was a special term that makes sure that the last line says and maybe one day he built he will be a billionaire like his little sister Kylie you know that line was why I did the interview in the first place right because it was such a yeah yeah it's sticking it in a stop you know so and they manage they put that last there and it was like take that red hand look we'll have fun this is liberals be doing a V baby yeah because liberals like eighty percent of the press think about it you know you got Tom Brady you know he playing sports you got the Liberals right in the newspaper you know there's a fight going on it was a big fight going on between right now there was not a lot of communication between side left and side up right mm-hmm I'm saying there's a fight going on and that's why you found yourself in the middle of that is because there's a lot of people on this on the left side who you call liberals who you have inspire and you give you've given us greatness and I know that that's not why you do it and I know it I am a liberal I'm a 200% ER mm every situation I understand my wife does something that makes me mad I'm like I understand your perspective of why you did right but it still makes me mad right i 100% feel and understand why people have their position that are on the left i 100% understand the people on the right and the issue is communication that people are not communicating and for people to mute themselves is what I thought was the the harshest thing to say if you're black don't talk to this person I'm gonna talk to everybody as long as I get air in my lungs like I would go pull up saved - hey Putin how you doing hey Kim Jong how you doing how they anybody I will talk I will have a conversation with anyone with respect and love I have loved it respect for everyone I don't have admiration for everyone but I have love and respect mmm-hmm Jesus is king Joanna tell people what's coming in dissembler oh yes Sunday service album Jesus is born on Christmas mm-hmm it's coming you will continue to build from here outward and I know you only think six months in advance well that's what you said before I don't buy that part actually I know there's maybe an aim of yours but I do think that you probably have a broader idea about what this becomes and where would you like to see this when you finally find a place for your we're at peace I just will keep getting used by God I don't love suffering no one loves pain but I'm still through the good times and through the suffering I praise God because I experienced the blessings and also experienced the lessons I'm just so blessed for everything I've been through to still be standing here and 15 years in be making an album with the work the paintings still are inspiring to me I want to hear them I want to listen to this I want to have you know music is my job that's why I'm putting out the album serving God and everything that I can do is my job that's why I'm here that's why I'm on the planet is to be in service in fear love and service to God barri was you know throughout the summer he had come by and played me a new album with playing the Solange album then you know just playing new artists and we'd be working on clothes and he's like okay clothes is good and ok cool this is a multi-billion dollar company that's cool be gay music is your job it should job this is what like I believe if I stopped doing music not because it promotes the brand I believe because God has given me a gift that I pray for and so many people love that if I stop doing it he might start to take other things away cuz Who am I to say oh I got these shoes now or oh we're building these hotels now or oh yeah you know I got a family now so I'm not gonna do music I'm not gonna give people he's new ideas that I have I had to really and you know it's fun it's a good job it's a fun thing to do and I quite enjoy is it as fun doing it now as it was doing it in Hawaii or doing it in Paris or doing it at the Mercer or doing it with J or doing it for J that's a good question well I'll tell you one thing I quite enjoy the sound of my own voice and apparently by the streams billions of other people do also but that's not what else is it as I just want to do that sound bite but go ahead now is it is fun or is it just different the job you know when you were wearing the backpack when you're sitting there making it or the footage of you in the studio just make you just literally vomiting up these beats like just it's spontaneously creating things like no one else can on this keyboard and making these bangers and coming up with this stuff is it is it as fun I mean we sit in here in front of ten chirps do did a little fun to you we could drive on the lake we got a lake look it's making music this fun is your job is what I'm saying this is a part of my job this is what I do in the midst of my job like when I hand the hand the new device we need still working on a name but the the portable stem player to my daughter and she's playing it and then she turns down the vocals and turns up the vocal her eyes light up this is feeling her eyes light up the way Jays eyes used to light up when I would come and play him a beat and that mean everything to at the time that was that was everything you were striving for at that moment in time that validation now the validation comes from your family well I don't know if it's about a validation as more it's not about validation it's about the light seeing Jay's face light up when I would play on those beats and now seeing North's face light up when she's playing with the device that we just created what is this device he keeps talking we go go back to studio we'll play it like but ticks in general are dark music has more of ability to be light similar to Tesla I'm about lighting the world up about being a light being a beacon and having other people experience joy through what we create whether they're holding the product that we create or experience a Sunday service or when they used to come to the tours and see the imagination someone up there with a mask on it it's not about entertainment as more as it's not about entertainment it's about imagination witness the imagination and feel good feel know that things are possible know that things that you feel are possible that's what that's my job that's what I'm here to do to do things you're like oh I didn't know that's why we got to go and take this shirt out on the lake so you can see that this thing literally drives on the lake and that it is possible for these to do that the and I think that that I think this is a good thing this anchor about you know comparing these moments of also the way people hear a reason why I love doing listening sessions is to be close to all these people here and the way they felt when they first see the light yeah we see the light you know whereas when an album is like release mass wide you can kind of hear views coming back or you hear people driving down the street that feels good yeah it's there's a communal element to music that streaming helps and it's actually it takes away from it a little bits like video killed the radio star streaming killed the videostar HSP hypersensitive people yeah I never heard that term before do you think that that is the thing that you're most misunderstood about and the way that you've been perceived and treated is that is that people ignored or perhaps didn't I understand your sensitivity levels yeah I also but I also fell as a camouflage if the system that supported kanye west's had any idea that I would make it to that telethon or make it to that Taylor Swift stage or make it to be the founder of this three billion dollar company they would have injected it with drugs way earlier they would have tried to do anything to stop it earlier but it's too late so it's been a camouflage and even right now as I speak there's a a wash of arrogance that because I've been diagnosed with mental health because I am black because I've been positioned in this entertainment field because I've had a red half of all these different things it it makes I'm you know when I talk it's a dog whistle because the people who need to hear it hear it and the people who don't need to hear it that should be afraid of it are too much bigots they're too much of bigots too Annamma say too much bigots because the use of incorrect English is also a common it's also a camouflage yeah there are too much bigots to believe that it could happen Bernard Arnault doesn't believe that the kid that had a backpack on will be standing across the stadium from jay-z the greatest rapper ever mm-hmm think about that and a little kid in baseline studio with a backpack on mmm someday to be across the across the stadium from one of his heroes Bernard Arnault is one of my heroes your dad is your number one hero yeah and then Bernard where did you talk about your dad before certainly no we've never spoken about your dad before oh man yes my dad is he has a water purification Center he don't know no raps he's stayed in homeless shelters less than 10 years ago just to help people he's a Christian marriage counselor ass's degree met you know met my mom in college it's like and now at age 40 at age 42 so many artists at age 40 like Tesla stop having sex at age 40 da Vinci said I'm not gonna paint rich women mmm anymore I'm gonna build bridges mmm at this age this is the age when you start to see you guys haven't even seen when they do books on what we've we're gonna make you're gonna look at the sound and say also yay sound it's all these different things we haven't really experienced what the paintings are yet you talk about being in prayer like a that Allen says so who need practice we don't have choir practice we have choir growth we have grown the amount of courts that I've listened to in the past year alone like an off time even when I was doing five albums in a row I was like old it's just like LeBron James back on the treadmill ya know that's you know just that that five hours was a part of my rehabilitation from coming from the hospital think about like when I was at Nike when I was at Nike there wasn't no virtue there wasn't no drag there was no Travis that was it was just like yay graduation and then when I left you know I had a brand antisocial social club they made the anti Calle Calle Club and Nike other versions to be airtight Kanye someone's gonna watch this and they're gonna start - it was gonna be an official anti Kanye Kanye Club trust me okay and they made the Pro Jesus Jesus Club then they gonna make a pro Jesus Jesus Club they're gonna make it bread Jesus Jesus but I go to the hotels and everything you're gonna build man well and building it for us other people's families not just no to building it for us for everyone just innovating thinking why does that plug have to go into that wall like that wallet what is this room this far away why is this couch design like this what's your life's work now from this point forward it is your life's work creatively it's what I am interested in expressing but it will only be expressed if it's in God's will because if God wants me to build these factories they shall be built and if God says that's not what I want you to do yeah yeah I want you to go I want you to sit in jail I want you to go to Sydney Africa for this amount of time for this reason I want you I don't know what God has planned a surrendering of control in your whole life is being about control exactly think about that it could go from being they said whatever God has planned that I am ready to be in service to God and whatever he has planned for me thanks for inviting us here this is the place this place is super special you know yeah well so let's walk back I shoot a machine please some music and then I'll go ahead and like finish the album oh yeah part two that's fire this is like yeah this is crazy this is one for the ages this is crazy so I guess you know anticipation of the album coming you know we should focus a little bit on on some of the some of the folks who have contributed to it because you know there are other people who are involved we just spoke about a couple of producers who have who have been involved in and clips are on the record and people know about that and getting those two back together you know creatively we know that they have a relationship but getting them on a record it could only be in this project right yes that's everybody's what they think this is the only one that's the only one no malice would come and wrap on correct yes correct so can you just talk us through the process of putting that to him in and getting that talk to a place where clips reunite for this project mmm it was just beautiful I mean I had uh they they were out here like or out working on that album just five months ago I remember saying I'm not even gonna rap and then it was serious about that you were interested in rapping I didn't know how to rap for God hmm I didn't you know so I remember no malice feeling like I'm a write you a rap for this you go rap on this cuz I'm a write you about he did say you gonna rap was a paraphrase he's I'm alright I'm alright around and he must have been over you know he must have been euphoric at the idea of you being able to identify with what he had he had established fit also absolutely yeah he's just sent a verse over right now the second verse for this song I'm playing you with victory on it song called glory just sent over a second verse idea so as you see we finish in verses tonight and right and still writing new stuff absolutely like this is such a win for the kingdom for Kanye to come back home from going from jesus walks to I love it and they say I give it up to you god I tried it my way is not working now it's not working out I got you know everything is in shambles I'm ending up in debt least I'm seeing you know all we're making this money but still ended up in debt my public standing is all in shambles I'm you know I'm not I'm not in good shape I'm having ups and downs with my health people calling me crazy people not wanting to sit and meet with me and this all this has happened I had to just give it all up to God and not use any of you know the tacticity you know even like let's say I'll be known as my new Drake and all this kind of hotlines or whatever it's like no we got to go in and say that it's all in God's hands it's just praying when you pray things don't always happen exactly when you want them to happen there's is a God's time it's not in your time and God may have you suffer to use you to show you something to show someone else something that's God why do I have to suffer why don't I have to go through this night but it's a bit as a part of a bigger plan so where does that leave push pushes coming along but I can't speak I can't speak on his journey and his walk but he know he knows God is real you know there's there's things where people know God is real but the tangible and the physical things are so in front of us and Cuddy on reborn which is an important moment of kids in ghosts right mm-hmm that's a song that ultimately set you on the path even though that record came out you were still on your way to Chicago to denounce Jesus the interesting timeline for that yeah it's interesting that it's reborn because Cuddy's not Christian and I wasn't and you would and yet that song was almost a declaration of yeah eight months I don't know if it said I think I was in the path since I was born god I've always had me on this path and you know after surrounded myself with Sunday service with all of these god-fearing god-loving people singing you know I really had a luxury soundwave treatment to show me how God is so good and I was led with light and it's funny because God led me with light to him but then I'll turn around and be screaming and other people that are not in the same place in their journey you know pointing fingers and being judgmental and you're over that now to a degree I'm still human I still hurt I still get mad but it's interesting Jo drugs in the studio no alcohol in the studio can you be around that stuff all alcohol but yeah no but some people you know I have a medical condition where they have to smoke weed mm-hmm and you're okay with that well yeah you saying what do I condone on a property inside of my studio specifically mm-hmm you know I'm early on into the walk and I believe that there's certain things that haven't been defined completely but definitely I mean we never have people doing hard drugs in our in our studio yeah any way whenever I've never seen someone do cocaine in a studio of mine I never seen anyone smoke crack I've never seen anyone do heroin but pills are a friend of heroin there it's a oxy cognizant opioid so I remember you know having surgery and then having the painkiller and then after the pain was gone I'd still be popping the pills that maybe taken more than one and the feeling that thing that set off it's a similar feeling to when you climax so that shows you why sex is just as much a powerful drug as opioid whereas heroin yeah so when you saw me at the MTV Awards the year after my mama had passed that was like if I was a heroin addict with the needle and a heroin addict with the needle coming out of my arm like I don't really care about living anymore and I just thank God for saving me physically mentally spiritually yeah my last question is um at this point in your life at 42 and being a man of faith serving God spreading the gospel have you been able to find peace with the challenges of your life that you didn't bring up on yourself the loss of your mum the exposure to pornography at a young age the things that set you on your path that you've had to process yes I'm at peace its I give it all up to God it's sometimes we will sit around and start to get mad about something or um you know about to scream about something and I'm rude you know I had a rude I have a rude spirit and I had a rude spirit that I need to work on grace a lot of people there's things that they need to work on man I am like just prepped to be a Christian you know you get stereotyped you know Smita stall and say oh do you play balls is that you just take everything about my personality but like all you would make a perfect Christian don't you want to hold on to someone that fight isn't that fine needed don't need some of that fighting you still like that what is that the fight just cuz you a Christian don't mean you ain't got fight I mean the rudeness let me be more specific well that's what I've got to say the thing I pray for to be more christ-like is the grace is its I have to pray for grace and then as God strengthens my hand is to have more grace like we as human beings inside of the game of life do there's a disability where I might be slightly upset about something later today I pray that but doesn't seem to go about two days didn't something new to be hah I'm upset about that these are like new challenges that we're at with life it's completely landscape has changed around here taking you know meetings and doing partnerships on building factories and building our own farms and in these new challenges there will be things you're frustrated about it's like if you went to different levels of the video game like I'm less frustrated about the snare or a hi-hat I've been doing that so long a call it Manny Marroquin I call it Mike Dean we have our production staff everything we've got that completely under control I don't have any idea you know of how you have an idea but I don't have experience doing the things I'm talking about yeah yeah and in that experience there's gonna be some cuts and some bruises but I'm ready to go in it's one of those like jumping in the deep and things like if you knew how you know difficult certain things where you might not jump in to be able to receive be able to receive how rewarding they are on the other end and we we in the defense we always stay we stay in deeper I'm not shallow I'm deep Oh muck everything's gonna be on the deep in (Phone dialing) (Dial tone) ♪♪ (Phone dialing) (Dial tone) (Dial tone) (Phone dialing)

Listen to me... ♪♪ (Phone static) (Phone dialing) welcome to wwdc our iphone has become indispensable so this year we've set out to make facetime calls feel more natural comfortable and lifelike we're bringing spatial audio to facetime now your friends voices are spread out to sound like they're coming from the direction in which their position on the video call next let's talk about two powerful new options for your microphone the first is voice isolation when you're on a facetime call your mic is picking up a cacophony of sound so in voice isolation machine learning distinguishes these sounds blocks out the ambient noise and prioritizes your voice sometimes though we want every bit of sound to come through and that's when you switch to wide spectrum in wide spectrum your mic picks up an entire symphony's worth of sound your voice and everything around you when you want to see every face in the room you can now turn on grid view giving you another way to view your group facetime calls and to make your facetime video capture more beautiful than ever we're introducing portrait mode in facetime portrait mode blurs the background and naturally puts the focus on you next to help you schedule your facetime calls we've created facetime links now you can generate a link for a facetime call and share it anywhere you can send the facetime link in places like messages email whatsapp or jump into calendar and it's not just apple devices that can use a facetime link to join your call your friends with android and windows devices can use your facetime link to join the call right from their browser and even on the web facetime calls are still end and encrypted so your privacy is never compromised we love enjoying shared experiences and so we built share play share play is a powerful new set of features for shared experiences that you can enjoy when you're on a facetime call with share play you can bring music into your call for a shared listening experience unlike any other watch movies and tv shows while having rich real time connection with your friends and share your screen giving you limitless possibilities for bringing apps right into your facetime calls share play is unlike any other shared content experience out there because it moves fluidly throughout the whole system maybe you want to order takeout while you watch picture and picture lets you see your friends and the video you're enjoying together and controls are always accessible with just a tap and when the moment calls for a bigger screen you can extend the video to your apple tv and watch it there while sharing the moment with your friends over face time on your iphone so in addition to apple music and the tv app shareplay is designed to work with your other favorite apps and streaming services with an api built for easy adoption developers can bring their own apps right into facetime and it works across apple devices next when it comes to staying connected throughout the day our go-to is messages look at this brand new collage design in this cool stack with even more photos from taylor i can quickly swipe through them tap to view the full bunch and even add a quick tap back now let's see what's going on with my friends they're always sending me all kinds of things like this fun playlist from leah and this mission critical article from casey about what type of pizza is best so now if i head over to the news app there's a new shared with you section that conveniently surfaces that pizza article and a few for my other friends now that i'm ready to learn more i can take a look and check this out up top it shows me who it's from and i can tap from casey to pick up our conversation and remind her that deep dish is obviously the best kind of pizza so now if i want to check out that playlist leah sent earlier i can head over to apple music and it's right here remember those great pictures from my family's trip to joshua tree well over in the photos app the new shared with you section makes it super easy to get back to them they'll also appear in my featured photos and memories and what's really cool is they're automatically brought over to my library too and photos are smart enough to only bring over the ones i actually care about like the ones i was there for so i don't have to worry about screenshots or memes cluttering up my library we've built shared with you into safari apple podcasts and the apple tv app and if something especially important comes through you can quickly pin it and it'll be elevated and shared with you and places like search of course that means making the time for it so we have new tools to help you focus on what matters most and that starts with notifications they have a fresh new look contact photos for people and larger icons for apps making them even easier to identify to help you engage on your own time we're introducing the notification summary a helpful collection of your notifications you can schedule to be delivered at any time you choose we use on-device intelligence based on how you interact with your apps to arrange the summary so it's easy to quickly catch up notifications in the summary are ordered by priority with the most relevant ones rising to the top notifications from people will not end up in the summary so you won't miss important messages as they come in if now really isn't a good time you can use do not disturb to silence all notifications now when you're using do not disturb your status is automatically displayed in messages when you reach out to someone who's indicated they don't want to be disturbed you'll be reminded in that moment and for truly urgent messages there's a way to get through in these moments you can use do not disturb or strike more of a balance with focus with focus all you have to do is choose what you want to focus on when setting up a focus we use on-device intelligence about your past activity to suggest apps and people to allow notifications from you can even dedicate a page on your home screen to match your focus and organize your apps and widgets in a way that reduces temptations by making only your work apps visible we'll even intelligently suggest using a focus based on your context using different signals like location or time of day of course you can create a custom focus too and when you use a focus on one device it automatically sets on all your other devices let's get started with a feature we call live text it starts with the camera let me show you let's say i just finished a meeting with the team and i want to capture my notes from the whiteboard i can now just point the camera at the whiteboard and an indicator appears here in the lower right when i tap it the text just jumps right out i can use my normal text selection gestures just drag and copy now i can switch over to mail and paste those in and then send this off to tim and this is great for photos already in your photo library to find out

this fall we hope you've enjoyed today's event and that you're excited for the week [Music] ahead uh ♪ "Purusha" by NVDES ♪ ♪ ♪ welcome to minecraft but there are custom apples in today's video we're gonna be crafting apples from literally any item in the game and when i say any item i really mean any item in the game ranging from a dirt apple to even diamond block apples can i beat the dragon what happens if i eat a tnt apple stay tuned to find out and a lot of you guys watching are new and not subscribed so if you do enjoy the content feel free to subscribe with me in three two one there we go welcome to the team and for today let's eat the lyco of holy that's big one like can we edit and before we start the video i just want to announce that i finally have merch out guys my merch will only be out for two weeks so get it while you can at shop.access store dot io or click the link in the description down below anyways guys enjoy the video so today's challenge is gonna be a little bit weird where we're literally gonna be trying to beat minecraft today by only getting apples and making different types of apples literally from any item in the game and when i say any item i really mean any item we can make it from cobblestone from dirt from carrots from fish from even diamonds emeralds and i think to the point that we can even make another white apple which might be a little bit too expensive but you know what if we can make another right apple we're making another right apple but i'm not there guys because not only do we have a village right there but we also have a not one but two brand new literal apple trees right by us which is definitely gonna speed up the process a lot of actually getting these apples and we can go ahead with these apple trees go ahead and get some apples is this already apple oh no it's not ripe okay we only can get the red apples nice i actually don't know what happens when you eat these type of apples but i mean why not let's go ahead and try to make a what okay an 8-bit apple okay what oh a 4-bit apple what okay so apples go all the way down to 4-bit apples i i have no comment on that wait what do i put two apples 32-bit apple wait guys okay i'm kind of really curious so if we put two 32-bit apples we get a super 64-bit apple but let's go ahead and actually make our first apple being the dirt apple which uh doesn't give us any information oh we got an achievement for it advancement made a dirt apple all right please be good wait what what what okay it was only for two seconds okay all right i think that's enough with the bad apples let's actually go ahead and try to go to this village see if we can find some good stuff and you already know that later in this video we're going to be going for the diamond apple the netherey apple i think there's an emerald block notch apple like there's a lot of really good apples oh wait what if we make a pumpkin apple okay i'm gonna grab this actually all right so we got nine pumpkins oh and there we go we got a pumpkin apple which you know i gotta eat it why not pumpkin apple what does this do oh ender protection that that actually does make sense so i think i might actually want to get one of those for the end oh bed okay i think there is a bad apple too literally apple for everything some bread there is a bread apple too like literally everything's an apple holy pumpkins okay we're gonna get as many as i can okay so with this we can at least make one more pumpkin apple and i'm gonna definitely be saving one of these for the actual very end wait coal colapple okay we're getting somewhere i still gotta get a lot of apples before i go mining so i'm gonna get this coal go back to getting the apples and this is all leading up to probably the netherway apple the diamond notch apple the netherey notch apple wait pig apple the techno blade apple oh i think this might be enough pigs guys okay so with this many pork chops i think we should be able to a pork chop apple huh not too sure about the pork chop apple but you know what i definitely need more apples and before i get a few more apples i think i need to get some iron because i actually do know one way besides apple trees to get a lot more apples welcome to the apple apple video honestly let me know in the comments down below how many times i say apple this video because this could be too many my goals are definitely get a diamond apple a notch apple i guess a notch apple would be kind of useless oh my gosh that could have been bad all right let's um eat some bread and actually get some iron i'm gonna go back get some more apples and i think i know a few things that might help let's actually get apples and also make the mining a little bit easier on us so i'm only gonna get too iron for now our secret weapon is gonna be the shears and you guys are gonna see very soon why i say that okay so first up guys i'm gonna get leaves and you guys are gonna see soon why i'm getting so many leaves it's gonna be very worth it holy apples okay those are definitely some ripe apples okay this should be enough we're gonna go for the leaf apple now so what i'm gonna do with the leaves guys is i'm gonna make a leaf apple if i stand in the middle of this forest and eat the leaf apple oh okay and that is gonna be one easy way to literally get unlimited apples and all i really gotta do is just make more leaf apples i'm gonna go ahead and make seven leaf apples and this forest is gonna be gone like literally it's gonna be gone in three two one boom oh my gosh okay so after all that in total we have 42 apples yes so now that i'm done actually getting all the apples i need let's actually go for the big boy apples and try to get some diamond apples i don't need apples even golden wait golden apples are normal we probably don't want golden apples yeah golden apples are kind of lame now i want that diamond apple though it's gonna be expensive probably but we are getting the diamond apple if i'm not wrong i'm pretty sure we need a lot of diamonds for it but you know what we're gonna go for it either way wait what about feather apple is this a thing oh there really is a feather apple nice okay i feel like i want to save this i still have some apples i haven't tried out yet but i don't want to use them all right away because i feel like a lot of them are really cool i would make an iron apple right away but i feel like i should make an iron pickaxe first to actually mind some good stuff and hopefully we can also make the diamond apple and if we get really lucky maybe an emerald apple not sure about the emerald apple then netherride apple is gonna be even harder okay so i have enough iron now for actual iron armor but after this we should be in the clear to actually finally make an iron apple i think an iron ink apple is possible but i'm not too sure actually i'm gonna real quick do an experiment what if we can make a stone apple i feel like that wouldn't be healthy eating stone but you know what at one point in your life you should probably eat rocks that that no you shouldn't do that what am i saying okay let's make an iron apple before i say anything else oh wait actually looks really cool and just like that we get an iron apple and it's actually blue text when all the other apples are normal white text interesting not sure if i should eat it right now but you know what we're doing it why not what do we get we got region absorption resistance 2 and fire resistance already the iron apple is actually probably the best one so far can i make an apple apple wait what oh i can and it's literally called an apple apple what what does this do i'm guessing it just gave me saturation what i just wasted so many apples i got a lot of eggs too oh there's a chicken name the chicken okay so where were we okay so we got the eight stone and of course you can make a stone apple i'm gonna eat it either way i feel like this is gonna be bad for me because uh nothing good comes out of eating rocks let's eat it weakness okay i ate some rocks and i got weakness very nice game finally found some gold but i don't really need gold for anything like a golden apple would be kind of boring this video we're not going for the golden apples i'm just gonna grab the gold right now in case i think of something related good for gold maybe we can make a normal notch apple with gold blocks but we're not gonna be going for those golden apples i could make a lapis apple actually hopefully we can actually make a lapis apple okay so with that we get oh it's real and just like that we get a lapis and zulu apple which i don't have any idea what this does bad omen how did we just get bat omen okay out of all the things to get from lapis i get bad oh wait am i gonna start a raid i'm right by a village oh this is not good okay we're not eating lapis again guys psa don't eat lapis i need to start being a little bit careful with my diet because i feel like right now everything is trying to kill me also we found a mine shaft and i'm gonna try to eat the mine shaft never thought i'd say that sentence but it's true oh we could eat cobwebs hold up it worked oh my gosh we got a cobweb apple i'm gonna go and i need it why not we got wait spider-man web slinger wait oh wait what no no wait you can throw spiders what the heck okay this thing is literally trying to kill me so i now have unlimited cobwebs and i'm probably gonna be using this against mobs that aren't spiders that's actually pretty useful and just like that we also got a bow a minecart please be something good that is actually really good loyalty one i don't have a trident but either way that's actually a really cool book i'm going to be keeping that some golden gets too oh another minecart please be good another wait what how do we get another loyalty one book what are the chances of that we also got oh my gosh a golden apple sapling i didn't even know that was a thing i don't know how that just happened we got two loyalty one books back to back in a literal golden apple sapling which low-key i need some bone meal right away to actually grow that another chest and another golden apple sapling okay this game is loving me right now so looking at this lava i have a little bit of an idea guys i know i'm saying the word apple a lot but what do you guys think about what if we make a lava apple also i feel like a lava apple would be really cool i'm gonna try to get enough iron to get a lot of lava buckets all right i might have enough buckets now so nine lava buckets and with these lava buckets i think we might actually be able to make a lava apple and we were right okay lava apple i'm kind of scared of this one all right i got the water bucket just in case but let's why not eat a lava bucket and yeah it was probably gonna do that okay that was actually a scam why did i take the time to do all that that that was definitely a dumb idea we're not doing that again i need to already get some diamonds and make a diamond apple oh little spot and oh diamonds nice okay first of all the diamond is not too bad and it looks like it's only a twin could be a lot worse but something probably need some more apples soon oh diamond all right a nice six vein too okay okay we can actually finally make a diamond big no wait i just realized i could have made a diamond apple oh i'm actually throwing guys okay let me go ahead and make a diamond sword i guess too the goal is still the diamond apple with another white apple i also hear an enderman maybe an enderman apple too how's it going mr enderman actually gotta kill a lot of you guys all right one two three four five there we go all right nice ender pearl that's our first ender pole for the enderman apple oh wait obsidian apple watch this guy's fastest obsidian minor in minecraft there we go okay nice all right so hopefully this should be enough for and we can't make an obsidian apple but on the bright side we can use this to go to the nether and also go ahead and make an enchant table which i'm also wondering can we make an engine table apple tnt apple what if oh wait i could easily make a tnt apple if i find a desert temple when we go back up to the surface we are 100 go for that tnt apple it's probably gonna end up killing me but it's for science so it doesn't matter we found our first emerald i might actually go for that emerald apple guys i'm still not 100 sure if an emerald apple is actually a thing and it's probably gonna only give me like luck or something but if we're under extreme hills and we oh wait another emerald nice okay if we were under an extreme hills and emerald apple actually sounds pretty cool all right that's two emeralds six more to go and i also need seven more diamonds because i wasted all the diamonds and look at that guys okay we found another diamond vein finally and it's all one vein okay back to trying to get more diamonds and emeralds i really want to make these two apples all right i just need one more emerald wait is that diamonds oh my gosh i barely saw it that it actually blended in so well with the water i didn't know it was a damn level all right four diamonds right there not too bad we need one more oh as i was about to say it we needed one more emerald and just like that we have all eight emeralds we need and so with this we get and i was right we get the emerald apple which i don't know what this does but i'm gonna assume just like the iron apple it's probably gonna do something very good i kind of want to save it for the nether actually so let's go ahead and go to the nether eat the emerald apple and try to get all the blaze rods and ender pearls we need and then hopefully on the way there we can somehow find some more diamonds because i need in total four more diamonds to actually get the diamond apple all right let's do this boom boom boom and finally boom all right here we go guys i got that rolled up already i only have one ender pearl oh my gosh okay i just got in here i really didn't come prepared for this here uh come down here buddy oh wow that worked all right i'm gonna have you uh doing some trades real quick buddy oh is that a fortress over there oh okay we spawned literally right by a fortress i'm trying to get these guys to trade with me can we make a netherrick apple i'm a little bit concerned about this one i'm not even sure if i should eat it oh we can okay netherrack apple yeah i think we're gonna hold on for another whack apple for now because i feel like some of these are actually really bad to eat so i'm gonna be very suspicious of anything never related to apples all right before i go to the fortress how's your trading been going buddy oh that's tender pearls that was definitely worth it guys we got our fair share of ender pearls right there and 34 spectra oil is not bad we finally got to the fortress i'm only here for the blazes and maybe some netherware we could get some diamonds here though oh gosh a cursed apple and some netherwork i'm gonna ignore the netherwork but a cursed apple oh gosh i think i'm gonna say the cursed apple though to the very end just in case it does kill me or something because i really don't want to die right now all right that's just normal stuff this just another curse two cursed apples another cursed apple again three cursed apples and i have no idea what it does i'm gonna go fight the blazes now i'm already on fire and i just got here all right first place rod not too bad i think i'm gonna get a lot of these because i feel like we could make a lot of apples from blaze rods oh my gosh okay that that's a lot of them okay uh guys please please i forgot to make a shield it's not good okay i completely forgot guys i have them rolled apple i'm just gonna eat this right now emerald apple please oh my gosh okay never mind we are set what the heck oh my gosh okay i'm literally gonna get the blazer on so quick now so we got absorption four strength two regen three health boost and fire resistance i could not ask for a better apple right now oh my gosh the places don't stop coming guys i ran out of the emerald apple this might be a little bit bad but it's all good emerald apple was definitely worth it but can we make a blazer on apple we can oh gosh don't we do it okay i'm gonna do it for science when the blazes spawn i'm gonna eat this blaze rod apple and see if it does anything good please rod apple it set me on fire and it gave me fire resistance i mean i kind of just wasted eight blaze rods doing that it was for science but it definitely wasn't worth it okay blaze powder does not work i think i'm gonna be smart this time and actually make some eyes of ender oh man time to grind all right these two should be my last one i'm just gonna go ahead and break this because i don't think i need more blazer rods after nine this should be enough for the stronghold and also getting a bunch of fire chargers so let's go ahead and start with only four eyes of ender because i actually want to try one thing real quick is this possible oh it's possible ender pearl apple i just wasted a lot of enterprise doing that but i feel like this is a really cool one and this is actually probably going to get us back home okay there's a gas right there my portal's that way what if i used to enter pro apple that way oh okay it tp'ed me to a random spot honestly that was not worth the eight ender poles it just teleported us randomly that was not worth it at all all right let's go back all right i think we should have everything we need we got the 12 eyes of ender a lot of blaze powder i think i'm gonna go for the fire charge apple next i think that might be a really cool one oh a spawner okay spider spawner don't plan on really using spiders for anything besides like skilling them so i think a fire charge is this right yeah okay one two and i think we only need one more okay there we go i mean why not let's go ahead and make as many as we can and so hopefully this works and it does okay yes and with that we got actually a pretty cool looking fireball apple not bad so what does it do i'm kind of afraid of this one and we got oh fireballs hold up oh i can just right click and throw fireballs that is actually a pretty big explosion oh my gosh okay i think we found the main weapon for the dragon guys this is actually a really cool ability and i got it for a whole minute holy i keep finding diamonds under water finally though we actually found some diamonds please be more than one vein it actually has more than one vein wait this is a six vane this might be enough for the diamond apple guys and i am definitely gonna be saving that diamond apple for the dragon and with that we finally have enough diamonds i'm not gonna mess it up this time guys let's go ahead and do it we're gonna make the diamond apple then i'm gonna try to get the tnt apple and i'm not gonna eat the diamond apple up until i fight the dragon because if the emerald apple was good the diamond apple is definitely gonna be worth it look at this thing what is that wait what this is redstone that's not redstone wait am i going crazy is this like a new ore wait what guys we just got ruby okay this is supposed to be an apple video why are there rubies in here is there a ruby apple wait there's more rubies over there okay we got another diamond let's ignore that though we don't need more dimes unless we might gotta make more diamond apples but can we make a ruby apple i'm not even sure what you use ruby's for why is this here can we make this oh my gosh we can ruby apple okay i gotta do it guys we're eating the ruby apple what do we get projectile protection really really projectile protection i've wasted all those rubies for suppression protection okay all right i think we're done mining oh wait more rubies wait and more diamonds what the heck is this cave right now literally just never ending good stuff i was gonna say i'm gonna start going to the stronghold now and maybe hopefully we can find a temple on the way but i'm finding non-stop stuff right now oh no we can't make ruby armor i guess that's kind of useless all right all right might as well make some time in likings why not all right diamond leggings and traction one not bad all right let's start heading to the stronghold all right so we gotta head that way okay it broke on the first try what what is my luck oh we found a temple okay i haven't tried a cactus apple either i'm probably gonna make the two dumbest apples the tnt apple and the cactus apple ah respiration tea more golden apple saplings some diamonds actually too not bad uh some gunpowder some more diamonds oh gosh we might be able to make some armor and for the important part guys i think it's time for us to risk it and make a tnt apple att one apple tnt apple i really feel like this is probably a bad idea so i have a little bit of a plan i'm gonna put water down oh man i'm not sure if i should do this ashley i think i'm gonna wait till i beat the dragon to eat the tnt apple i really don't want to risk dying right now i'm so close to finally beating this challenge so stay tuned and i'll not only eat the tnt apple but also the cursed apple and whatever other apples we have that might kill me you know what i can't whistle on two apples let's see if we can make a cactus apple oh we can okay all right i'm gonna eat this one please don't be bad and we got nausea too okay nice okay we gotta go this way now oh it went back okay it's somewhere like right here it looks like there's a cave down here and the eye vendor went backwards this way so i'm just gonna dig straight down and hope for the best oh and we found it okay nice that actually was pretty quick could we make a stronghold apple feel like that probably make no sense actually yeah probably no point making stronghold apple oh wait something i can make though i just forgot let's go out and make another iron apple and iron apple would be probably really useful all right where is this portal i think oh never mind we found the portal nice all right i'm gonna real quick break you a spawner apple would probably be really cool but also probably not very appetizing at all neither was silverfish apple there's a lot of apples that aren't the best thing to eat okay we have all 12 eyes at least actually before we go in guys i'm a little bit curious can we make an air oh we can an arrow apple i might try this on the dragon that's actually a pretty cool one all right let's do this guys all right wish me luck guys here we go okay we're in that is a lot of enderman we got the dragon right over there okay i think the first thing we might do is just could do the old-fashioned way with our arrows and then use all the apples against the dragon to see if we can kill the dragon really quickly all right that's another one another one there another one there another one there all right that's another one used over there dragon no no no one there okay i'm gonna go at a golden apple we have one more all the way over there there we go okay finally all that's left now is just to kill the dragon don't fill this okay we're good all right mr dragon come down here oh i should have eaten the pumpkin apple casserole enderman now under protection oh my gosh okay that's perfect arrow apple what do you do oh that's actually pretty cool what the heck okay what about the fireball apple i'm gonna see if i can use the fireball apple on the dragon go on fireballs do your thing yes oh it's actually working it's not the most efficient thing but i'll take it the fireballs are actually doing pretty good work look at itself i'm about to get it down to half health oh my gosh did you guys see that okay all right feather apple what does the feather apple do it gave me slow falling probably would have been useful earlier oh it's coming down okay guys i think it's time for the diamond apple okay that is a lot of stuff wait strength one region three resistance three low key i think the emerald apple may have been better but either way the diamond apple is doing a lot of work wait what if we end the dragon with the tnt apple because i ran out of the diamond apple we only have the iron apple and the cursed apple left and i still don't know what this thing does i'm gonna eat one why not it set me on fire nice okay oh it's coming down all right iron apple time okay it's definitely not as good as the diamond apple but i think the emerald apple may have been the best one holy we are doing a lot of damage really quickly oh it's so close it's so close no yes and there we go guys i did not get to use a tnt apple on the dragon but that doesn't matter i didn't expect to hit that bow shot i actually wanted to kill with the tnt apple but that is gonna be it for minecraft but you can craft literally any apple from eddie block kind of messed up getting the dragon egg the first time but there we go we got the dragon eggs so with that being said this tnt apple was sponsored by bicycling the best server company in the world and we might as well eat it real quick and jump in oh never mind i hope you guys enjoyed have a great one and here's the video just like this one bye guys [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] bye [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] bye [Music] hmm [Music] [Music] you In 2017 construction on Apple’s new headquarters,
called Apple Park, was finally completed. It took four years to build, and cost Apple
over five billion dollars. That makes it one of the most expensive buildings
on earth. And many people have wondered what exactly
Apple got for their money. So in this video, we’re going to take a
look inside Apple Park and discover the buildings and facilities that make the headquarters
so special. This is Greg with Apple Explained. This topic came in second place in the last
voting poll and if you didn’t get a chance to vote, make sure you’re subscribed so
future polls begin appearing in your mobile activity feed. Alright now let’s start off with the main
building on Apple’s campus, which is officially called “The Ring.” It features four stories of office space for
over 12,000 employees. A walkway lines the inner and outer perimeter
of the building, which means it’d take about 7 and a half minutes to reach the opposite
side, or about 15 minutes to walk all the way around. But you may not mind the long walk, considering
the view you’d have while taking it. The Ring’s exterior is made up of 36 to
47 foot-long curved glass panels. Resulting in an open, seamless panoramic view
of the outdoor landscape. In fact, Apple Park was designed to be as
open as possible in order to encourage the free-flowing of ideas through chance meetings
between employees. That’s why office spaces are formed into
pods, or open office spaces where a worker could be in deep concentration one minute,
then bump into a colleague in the next. But not everyone was enthusiastic about this
approach. With many employees writing in to tech journalist
John Gruber criticizing the open floor plan. Even more complained about the glass walls
and doors, which were easy to run into when distracted. In fact, two workers were actually injured
and required hospitalization after walking into the building’s translucent walls and
doors. This prompted employees to stick post-it notes
on the glass to make the obstacles more noticeable, but they were quickly removed because they
detracted from the building’s design. Another way The Ring encourages employee interaction
is with one big restaurant instead of several small ones located throughout the building. That means employees have to walk further
to reach the cafe and increases the likelihood of interactions while eating since everyone
is forced into the same 58,000 square foot eating area. The restaurant itself is called Caffe Macs,
and features four-story sliding glass doors, the largest in the world, that open to the
courtyard on nice days. And to prove just how much Apple cares about
every detail, they actually patented their own pizza box that prevents the crust from
getting soggy. But there’s more to The Ring than meets
the eye, because hidden underneath the four story behemoth, is a two story parking garage
finished with reflective white tile, domed ceilings, and traffic lights seamlessly integrated
into the street signs. This allows workers to drive in and out of
Apple Park without obstructing the beautiful view. Speaking of which, the landscaping at Apple
Park is one of its most important features. Jobs loved the foliage work done on Stanfords
campus, and he tracked down one of the arborists responsible: David Muffly. Who oversaw the planting of 9,000 indigenous
trees at Apple Park. Hand picked not only for their appealing structure,
but also for their resistance to drought, which has only become more common. The courtyard area consists mainly of apricot,
olive, and apple orchards, plus an herb garden near the cafe. But there’s more than just foliage. Apple added an artificial pond that, just
like The Ring Building, also happens to be a perfect circle, there’s also a rectangular
field with a rainbow structure that actually serves as a stage for speakers or performances. The stage was actually co-designed by Jonathan
Ive and Foster and Partners. It uses the same rainbow colors as the early
Apple logo, and features rounded arches that can be fitted with lighting equipment. But it’s important to point out that The
Ring is just one of several buildings at Apple Park. If you travel to the northwest area, which
you can reach by using one of the gray Apple bicycles, you’ll find a building that may
look a bit out of place. It’s called the Glendenning Barn, and it
wasn’t part of Apple’s original plans. The barn was built in 1916 and happened to
be on the land Apple bought for their new headquarters. They wanted to demolish it completely, but
it had already been declared a historical site in 2004 by the city of Cupertino. So after some discussion, Apple agreed to
keep the barn and use it to store maintenance tools and other landscaping materials. Beside Glendenning Barn is a much larger building
that was part of Apple’s plans. It’s a 100,000-square-foot fitness and wellness
center. Complete with changing rooms, showers, laundry
services, group workout rooms, and a two story yoga room covered in stone. But not just any stone. Jobs made sure it was sourced from a specific
quarry Kansas, and carefully distressed, to make it look like the stone from his favorite
hotel in Yosemite. Moving further south, you’ll find the sports
fields. Where workers can enjoy a game of basketball
or tennis. And even further south is the Apple Park Central
Plant, which is attached to the southern parking garage. The central plant houses utility equipment
like fuel cells, back-up generators, chillers, condenser water storage, hot water storage,
an electrical substation, and water and fire pumps. While the parking garage allows for an additional
9,000 spaces for workers, for a total of 14,200 parking spaces at Apple Park. Heading east from the southern garage, you’ll
find my personal favorite building, the Steve Jobs Theater. It’s a circular building made up of curved
glass panels, topped with the largest carbon fibre roof in the world. There’s so many amazing details about this
building that I’ll probably make an entire video dedicated to it, so make sure you’re
subscribed for that. But long story short, the glass panels actually
act as support beams for the roof, so no columns or beams are necessary. And if you’re wondering where the actual
theater is, it’s all underground. You can reach the theater either by taking
the beautifully crafted curved staircase, or by walking into a glass elevator that slowly
rotates as it descends, allowing it to have just one door instead of two. The theater itself holds 921 people, about
three times more than Apple’s old Town Hall, while still retaining an imitate feel. And while much of the Steve Jobs Theater is
underground, it was place on the highest hillside in all of Apple Park. As a symbolic gesture of respect to he man
it was named after. Heading north-east from the theater, is the
Visitor Center. Which is the only part of Apple Park open
to the public. It’s a two-story building with four main
areas: An Apple store featuring exclusive merchandise like t-shirts, hats, tote bags
and post cards, a 2,300-square-foot cafe, an exhibition area that features a 3D model
of Apple Park that visitors can explore in detail using augmented reality, and a rooftop
terrace that overlooks the entire campus. The Visitor Center also has an underground
parking garage with almost 700 spaces. Now this five billion dollar headquarters
has received its fair share of criticism for being too extravagant and its construction
too perfectionist. But I think those words describe precisely
the type of campus Steve Jobs wanted for Apple. In the words of Tim Cook, “Steve’s vision
is reflected all around us at Apple Park. He would have loved it here, in this place
he dreamed up — the home and inspiration for Apple’s future innovations.” Alright guys I hope you enjoyed that peak
inside Apple Park, don’t forget to subscribe to see a more detailed video about the Steve
Jobs Theater and to help decide which topics I cover, and I’ll see you in the next video. Helena Bonham Carter: Imagine
 a future where one day  machine learning
 will give you the power  to track your sleep.  Helena: Imagine... Excuse me, ma'am?  Helena: Yes? Can I help you? Yeah, this already does that. Helena: Oh, I didn't know that. Well now you do.  Helena: Okay, let's
 try this again.  Helena: It's alright.
 I'll start again. Helena: Imagine one day a tiny
device with an optical sensor  will send you an alert
if your heart rate is too low. -Psst.
 Helena: Yes, What? It already does that.  Helena: What? Oh. Helena: Okay...well how about  will send you an alert  if your heart rate
 is too high. It already does that!  Helena: Alright, let's
 try something new... Helena: Will send you an alert  if you're some place
 that's too loud. I just received
one of those alerts.  Helena: Really, well you
 should probably find  a quieter place sir! You should probably
mind your own business.  Helena: Ugh. Okay. Imagine.
 One day. In the future... - Hold on.
Helena: No, no, no!
Let me finish... One second.  Helena: You'll be able to
 take an E-C-G... It already does that. Helena: It already does that. I heard that.  Helena: Good. Helena: What about continuously
 track your elevation?  Helena: Does it do that?
- Does that.  Helena: Right, got it.
- Does that.  Helena: Thank you.
- Does that.  Helena: Yeah, heard it
 the first time.  Helena: Encourages
 you to stay fit? Does that.  Helena: Okay. I get it.
 You're fit.  Helena: Umm, I don't know. Helena: Will it automatically
 call 9-1-1 if a bear chases  you off a cliff and
 you take a hard fall? Huh?  Yeah. Already does that.  Helena: Seriously? Yeah. Seriously.  Helena: You've got
 to be kidding me.  Helena: Okay.
 Okay, okay, okay I got it. Helena: Let's go from the top.  Helena: Imagine.  Helena: A day. A future.
 Imagine a future. Helena: One day a tiny device..
 blah, blah, blah.  Helena: That uses red
 and infrared light  to measure your
 blood oxygen level.  Helena: Yes? What?  Helena: No, no, no, no, no.  Helena:
 Don't you dare say it.  Helena: I'm sorry
 I can't hear you.  Helena: Very cute. ♪  Helena: Well. That was fun. (Cheers and applause) (Music playing) (Cheers and applause) >> TIM COOK: Thank you! Thank you! Thank you. Thank you. Wow! Thank you. Thank you. Good morning! And welcome to the
Steve Jobs Theater. As you can tell, today is
going to be a very different kind of event. We have got some really
exciting things to share with you, and we are going to
have some fun along the way, so let's get going. For decades, Apple has been
creating world-class hardware and world-class software. We have also been creating
a growing collection of world-class services, and
that is what today is all about. (Cheers and Applause) So what is a service? Well, if you look it
up in the dictionary, you will see that a service is
defined as the action of helping or doing work for someone. At Apple, our services are
actively working to help our customers get the most out of
their products and to enrich their lives. Using the iPhone as an
example, let's take a look at our services in action. The iPhone you carry with you
with its powerful hardware and powerful software allows you to
capture the very best moments of your life, and our iCloud
service helps you easily share those photos with loved ones and
automatically makes your entire photo library available across
all of your devices, anytime, anywhere, safe, and protected. This is just one example of
the benefits that come from the seamless integration
of hardware, software, and services. And this is something that Apple
does better than anyone else. (Applause) Thank you. Thank you. Now, we have a whole range
of services, like iCloud, our service which keeps your
contacts, calendar, notes, and, as I just showed
you, your photos, and even your documents
up-to-date across all of your devices. Siri is the most popular
personal assistant in the world that helps you get
things done just by asking. And Apple Maps, the most used
navigation system on iOS by far. Apple Pay is our service that
lets you make secure purchases in stores and
apps and on the Web. And we offer communication
services like Messages and FaceTime so you can
stay connected with people that you love. We provide services that help
you locate your devices with Find My iPhone or simply know
that your kids made it to school on time with Find My Friends. And then there is Apple Music
and Podcasts and Books and the App Store and Apple News,
services that deliver incredible content and experiences
directly to you whenever and wherever you are. Now, most of these
services are free, while some of them are paid,
offering very valuable content from talented creators,
storytellers, and artists. We take this same approach at
Apple with our services as we do our products. They have to be easy to use. They have an uncompromising
attention to detail and design and engineering. They are designed to
keep your personal information private and secure. (Applause) And with our
services, we do even more. They are curated by
our expert editors. They are
personalized just for you. And they are designed to be
shared with your entire family. Now, today we are excited to
extend our services even further making them even more
entertaining, more useful, and more informative. So let's get
started with Apple News. (Cheers and Applause) When we created Apple
News over three years ago, we wanted to provide the best
way to read the news on your iPhone and iPad, and we felt we
could make a difference in the way that news is
experienced and understood, a place where the news would
come from trusted sources and be curated by experts. Now, this is a very different
approach than others have taken. As Slate pointed out by
hand-picking its publishers and stories, Apple News prioritizes
a news source's reputation and the value of its content over
the propensity of its headlines to garner clicks and likes. (Applause) With news being
so important to us, it's critical
that it be trusted. With over 5 billion
articles read each month, Apple News is now the number
one news app! Unbelievable! (Applause) In fact, Apple News has become
an essential daily destination for millions of people. Our editors pick the Top Stories
every day so you can stay on top of important news. You get a personalized news
feed delivering stories on topics that are most
interesting to you, whether they come from
publishers that you regularly read or from ones that you
are completely new to you. Now, when it
comes to major events, our team of editors curate
collections of the best stories from news, and sports,
entertainment, and so much more. Now, probably like many of you,
I love the feeling of being at the newsstand with all of those
beautiful and thought-provoking magazines
covering so many topics. We want them all, but we
might only be able to get one or maybe two. But what if we
could have them all? Well, today we are
going to do just that. We are bringing
magazines to Apple News. (Applause) With amazing design
and striking photography, in-depth journalism,
magazines are iconic and a part of our culture. They follow and create the
latest trends in fashion and style, they entertain, they
educate us about the world we live in, they provide insights
into science and technology, they go behind the scenes with
exclusive interviews of our favorite artists, they feature
the work of some of the world's best journalists, they
cover the world of sports, they bring today's business
innovation and technology into focus, and they
tell stories that give us perspective. All of these magazines come to
life in an all new service that we call Apple News+. (Applause) This is going to take Apple
News to a whole new level. We've made a video about the
power of journalism and its cultural impact and I would
love to play it for you now. (Music playing) >> REBECCA TRAISTER: My passion
as a journalist has been to help readers better understand the
moment that we are living in. >> AARON HUEY: I definitely go
further to get a shot than my wife would like me to go. >> SAMIRA NASR: I think fashion
magazines play such a huge role. Magazines allowed me to
kind of see people that looked more like me. >> DANA SCRUGGS: You
have to have more voices. Representation in front of
the camera is important, but representation behind the
camera is even more important. >> REBECCA TRAISTER: One of the
functions of journalism in this moment is to offer a
fuller picture of power. Who has it? Who doesn't have it? And what the costs
of that have been. >> AARON HUEY: Photography
can take us anywhere in that infinite world of stories and
gives you an empathy that you could have never imagined. >> REBECCA TRAISER: Great
writing ideally helps people make sense of the world. >> WALTER IOOSS JR: Sports
photography is my life and that's what I have been
inspired by, freezing time. >> REBECCA TRAISER: Part of my
job is to shed light on stories that have been kept in the dark. >> AARON HUEY: The container
for these stories is changing. If we have a place to go to
that we can trust to hold all of those stories,
that is going to help. (Applause) Thank you. Thank you. Now, to tell you
more about Apple News+, I'd like to
invite up Roger Rosner, Vice President of
Applications. Roger. >> ROGER ROSNER: I'm thrilled to
tell you about the new service we are bringing to Apple News. Our goal for Apple
News+ was simple, we wanted to create the best
magazine reading experience ever for a mobile device. Apple News+ will bring you
over 3,000 magazines across all, I'm sorry, 300 magazines
across all sorts of topics, like entertainment,
fashion, news, and politics. We've got great
health magazines, and great lifestyle magazines. We've got
magazines for travelers, magazines for foodies,
magazines for gear heads. We've got magazines for just
about every passion under the sun. And Apple News+ is the only
place where you will find all of these magazines in
a single package. (Applause) To show it to you, I'd like
to invite up Wyatt Mitchell, Apple's Director of
Design for Applications. (Applause) >> WYATT MITCHELL:
Thank you, Roger. Let's take a look at
the new Apple News+. It all starts with the
same great Apple News free experience, and that means
it's got Top Stories, it's got Trending Stories,
and here are my personalized recommendations in for you. With an Apple
News+ subscription, the experience gets even better. It means I get
the latest magazines. With this design, we wanted to
add the best of the magazine experience into the app, and
that starts with the covers. We wanted to make
them even more inviting, an entrance into another world,
so we created the live cover. Check this one out
from National Geographic. It's an amazing aerial view. (Applause) It's an amazing aerial
view of Sydney, Australia, and what looks like
an incredible issue. So let's take a look. When I tap on the cover, I am
taken to the table of contents where I can see all the
articles in the issue. I can jump to whichever one
I'm interested in like this. And here I land in a
National Geographic article, beautifully designed, and
full of amazing infographics. Apple News+ makes the experience
of diving into an issue even more fun and exciting. It's really like having
National Geographic designed for my phone. And to get more, I can just tap
on the table of contents or I
can browse the issue by simply
swiping from article to article like this. I can read full magazine issues
no matter where or when right on my phone. All right, let me get
back to the Today tab. There are more recommendations
of articles and issues here, but the place to explore all
magazines is the News+ tab. Here we wanted to design a home
dedicated to everything about enjoying magazines. I can easily find my
favorite titles right here in My Magazines. There is the National Geographic
I was just looking at. Here's one of my all-time
favorites, the New Yorker. I'll also see suggestions like
Popular Science here based on my interests. And recent issues are
automatically downloaded so I will already have them
before I board a flight. Scrolling down, here is
one of our first looks. It's the new cover of Rolling
Stone featuring some of the stars of Game of Thrones. Now, everything here is curated
by the Apple News editors and personalized, which makes it
really easy to discover a great article or explore a topic like
this group of travel stories recommended for me. I have been reading a lot
about Costa Rica recently, and while I'm not a
regular reader of Marie Claire, I can see that News+ is
recommending their article on traveling there, which is
really smart and really great. I will also see featured
articles like this one from Wired Magazine, and new issues
like this one from Essence with Issa Rae on the cover. Now along with the cover, I
can see a few articles from the issue, which makes it
really easy to browse. Now I'm going to tap on this
cover story because I'm a big fan of her show Insecure. And here we enter another
beautifully designed article. Design plays such a
big part of magazines, we really wanted to give the
titles their ability to express their own unique look and
feel through their design, typography, and photography. This is really a
great example of it. This is Essence
designed for the phone. So it looks great
here on the phone. Let's take a look
at it on an iPad. I'm going to open up the
same article on the iPad. And as you can see, the
article looks fantastic here too, and nicely
adapted to the larger size. And just like on the phone, I
can always tap on the table of contents to navigate
to another article. I'm going to try
this beauty story. And here we have a
beautiful photo essay. The iPad really shows off
great photography like this. Now, if I'm looking for
something specific or just wanting to browse, I can
navigate to the full breadth of the catalog by just
tapping here at the top, and here I have hundreds
and hundreds of magazines. I can find my sports,
my music, my travel. I can find the entire Newsstand
that Tim referred to right here on my iPad. And that's the new Apple
News+, the best mobile magazine experience ever. Back to you, Roger. (Applause) >> ROGER ROSNER:
Thank you, Wyatt. I think Apple News+ is awesome. No one has ever made digital
magazines as gorgeous and readable as this. Whether you like to read
whole issues cover to cover or individual articles, Apple
News+ is the best way to read magazines on your device. But Apple News+ is
about more than magazines. Apple News+ also includes
some of the most popular premium digital
subscriptions like The Skimm. (Applause) But we didn't stop there. Apple News+ also includes the
country's largest metropolitan newspaper and a rising
star, the L.A. Times. (Applause) And I'm super proud to announce
that Apple News+ also includes one of the
world's top newspapers, The Wall Street Journal. (Applause) And, of course, Apple News+ is
built on a foundation of expert human curation
and industry‑leading personalization, so finding
what you are looking for in that incredible collection
of content is as easy as launching Apple News. When we announced Apple News,
we told you we designed it to be private from the ground
up, and that's still true, and it's even
more important today. So sometimes people ask us,
how do we recommend the best articles for you without
compromising your privacy? The answer is we download groups
of articles from our servers, and then we use on
device intelligence to make recommendations. And that means we don't
know what you read, and in addition to that,
we don't allow advertisers to track you. (Applause) So what you read about in
Apple News will not follow you across the Web. So Apple News+, over
300 great magazines, The Wall Street
Journal, the L.A. Times, those great premium
digital subscriptions. There has literally never been
an offer like this before. If you were to subscribe to
all of these individually, it would cost you
over $8,000 per year. But with Apple News+,
you pay $9.99 per month. (Applause) And that's not just for you. We thought this was so important
we decided to make this available to your entire
family with Family Sharing at no extra charge. (Applause) Each person in your family gets
full access to that incredible catalog on their own devices
with their own favorites and their own personal
recommendations. It's an amazing value. Apple News+ is available today,
just download today's updates of iOS and macOS and launch
Apple News and the first month is free. (Applause) And in addition to launching in
the U.S., I'm happy to say we are also bringing Apple News and
Apple News+ to Canada in both English and in French. (Applause) And we are adding over 30 great
Canadian magazines to Apple News+ along with the top
newspaper in Canada, The Star. (Applause) And later this year, we will
be bringing Apple News+ to Australia and we will be coming
to Europe starting with the U.K. (Applause) So that's Apple News+, a premium
subscription built right into Apple News that brings you the
world's best publications all in one place, built on the
principles that guide all of our services. We are super excited about this. We hope you like it. Thanks so much! (Applause) >> TIM COOK: This is
really important to us. We believe in the power of
journalism and the impact it can have on our lives. We want to make a valuable
contribution to the industry and to society as a whole. We think Apple News+ is going to
be great for customers and great for publishers. (Applause) Now let's talk about Apple Pay. (Applause) We launched Apple Pay with a
vision to replace the wallet, and people are
absolutely loving it. Apple Pay is the simplest, most
secure, and private way to pay, and its growth has been
literally off the charts. In fact, we are on target to
surpass 10 billion transactions this year. (Applause) This is huge! We are looking forward to a
future where all payments are made this way. Now, retail acceptance of Apple
Pay has already past 70% in the United States and it's even
higher in many other countries like Canada and the United
Kingdom and so many more which broadly accept Apple Play. In Australia, we have achieved
an amazing 99% acceptance. And we have been adding
more and more countries. And by the end of this year, we
expect that Apple Pay will be available in more
than 40 countries. (Applause) Apple Pay has also made
riding transit easier and more convenient than ever before. Every day, millions of customers
in these cities use their iPhone or their Apple Watch to go
quickly through the turnstiles and get on their way. And I'm excited to tell you that
we are bringing Apple Pay to transit in major
cities in the U.S. starting right here on the west
coast with Portland and rolling out in Chicago and New
York City later this year. (Applause) So retail, transit apps,
on the Web, Apple Pay cash, there are so many ways to use
Apple Pay with its convenience, security, and privacy. And it's become the preferred
way to pay for almost anything. But we want to take the Apple
Pay experience even further. And we saw an opportunity to
transform another fundamental method of payment, and
that's the credit card. Now, with the success and
momentum of Apple Pay, we have learned a lot
about credit cards. While we all need them, there
are some things about the credit card experience that
could be so much better, like simplifying applications,
eliminating fees, lowering interest rates,
offering clear and compelling rewards, and, of course,
providing the security and the privacy that people have
come to expect for Apple Pay. By bringing together
our hardware, software, and services, we are going to
do all of this and so much more changing the entire
credit card experience. Today we are introducing a
brand-new service and we call it Apple Card. (Applause) Apple Card was created by Apple
and built on principles that we stand for like simplicity
and transparency and privacy. To tell you all
about Apple Card, I'm very pleased to
invite up Jennifer Bailey, Vice President of
Apple Pay. Jennifer. (Applause) >> JENNIFER BAILEY: Thank you. With Apple Card, we
have completely rethought the credit card. A new kind of card that takes
advantage of everything iPhone offers is designed for a
healthier financial life and sets a new level for
privacy and security. Apple Card is designed
to take advantage of the power of the iPhone. This means it can do all sorts
of things that no other credit card can do. For starters, you don't have
to wait days to get your card. Just sign up on your iPhone,
and in just minutes you get your Apple Card and you can
start using it right away. (Applause) You can use it worldwide
anywhere with Apple Pay, in apps, in stores, on the Web,
and your Apple Card will be available across all
of your Apple devices. Apple Card is also always with
you because it's in your iPhone in the Wallet app, and the
Wallet app has completely new capabilities, so you can see
everything you need to know about your Apple Card,
like what you have spent, how much you've spent,
and when your payment is due. We've also made it
really easy to get help. With Apple Card, if
you have a question, just text us
right from Messages. Everything from getting details
on a transaction to letting us know your new address, it's
as easy as messaging a friend. (Applause) Next, we've taken on an
important challenge with Apple Card to help everyone live
a healthier financial life. It starts with having a better
understanding of your spending so you can make smarter
choices with your money. Many of you looking at your
credit card statements today might recognize seeing
transactions that look like this, cryptic merchant
names that are pretty hard to decipher. With Apple Card, we use Machine
Learning and Apple Maps to transform this mess into
names and locations that you will recognize. (Applause) Apple Card also
automatically organizes and totals your purchases, so you
can see how much you've spent and exactly where you've
spent it with Apple Maps, and you can keep track of your
spending by categories like food and drink, shopping,
entertainment, and more. Where each category is
represented by its own color, like orange for food and drink,
and Apple Card also shows you how your spending is trending
week over week or month or month, so you can decide in real
time if you need to or want to change your spending. Next up, let's
talk about rewards. Most rewards
programs use points. With points, you are never quite
sure how much they are worth or where or when you can use them. With Apple Card, we want you
to get the most for your money. So every time you spend with
Apple Card, you get cash back, and you get it every day. It's my favorite feature,
and we call it Daily Cash. (Applause) So when you are
buying your morning coffee, shopping for groceries, and any
time you pay using Apple Card, you get Daily Cash, not a
month from now, but every day. So every day you spend, cash is
added to your Apple Cash Card, which is also in the Wallet app. And it's cash, like real cash,
so you can do anything with it. Use it to pay down your balance,
spend it wherever you use Apple Pay, or send it to
friends using Messages. In fact, every time you pay
with your iPhone or Apple Watch, you will get 2% of the
purchase amount in Daily Cash. (Applause) And for purchases
made directly from Apple, like from our Apple Retail
stores, from our App Store, or when you purchase services
like Apple Music or News+, you get 3% Daily Cash. (Applause) And the amount of Daily Cash
that you can receive every day is unlimited. So that's Daily Cash. Every day, cash, for you. How great is that? (Applause) Another area where we can make
a really big impact in improving your financial health is helping
you understand how much you owe, and if you want to
pay it back over time, how much it will cost you. This is how most cards
show your payment options, with an emphasis
on minimum payments, which costs you a
fortune in interest, and seem to be designed
to keep you in debt. With Apple Card, our goal is
to help you save on interest, so we start by making it easy to
see a range of payment options. And because Apple Card
calculates interest in real time, as you select
different payment amounts, you can make a more informed
payment decision understanding the true cost. Another way to save on
interest is to pay more often, say, biweekly or weekly, so we
have added the flexibility to schedule more frequent payments. And when we thought about a
financially healthy credit card, all of the fees and high
interest rates that most banks charge are just not okay. So Apple Card does not
have any fees, no late fees, no annual fees, no international
fees, and no over limit fees. No fees. (Applause) And our goal with Apple Card is
to provide each customer with an interest rate that is among
the lowest in the industry. Even if you miss a payment, we
won't charge you a penalty rate like most banks do. Our goal is to make it easier
for you to pay down your balance, not harder. To create a credit
card, you need a bank, and to create a credit card
as innovative as Apple Card, we needed a bank that was
willing to do things that had never been done in
the industry before, so we partnered with Goldman
Sachs as the issuing bank of Apple Card. As a newcomer to
consumer financial services, Goldman was up for the
challenge of doing something more bold and innovative. We are also excited to be
working with MasterCard who has been a fantastic partner
on Apple Pay from the start. With MasterCard's
Global Payment Network, Apple Card will be
accepted all over the world. (Applause) We also designed Apple
Card to set a new level for privacy and security. Security is totally
integrated throughout the hardware and software. When you get your Apple Card, a
unique per device card number is created and stored
safely in the Secure Element, a special security
chip used by Apple Pay. Each payment includes a one‑time
dynamic security code which protects your card number
from being used without your authorization, and every
purchase is authenticated with Touch ID or Face ID. With all of these
security features, Apple Card is the
more secure way to pay. And Apple Card is designed
with your privacy in mind. We created a unique
architecture for Apple Card where Apple doesn't know what
you bought, where you bought it, or how much you paid for it. So features like spend tracking
and categorization all happen using on device
intelligence, not on Apple servers. (Applause) And for Apple Card, Goldman
Sachs will never share or sell your data to third parties
for marketing or advertising. (Applause) So that's Apple Card, designed
for iPhone and a healthier financial life and sets a new
level for privacy and security. But that's not all. For those rare times when you
happen to be somewhere where Apple Pay is not yet
accepted, we designed something for that, too. And, you know, when
we design something, we design it to be the best,
and we would like to show it to you now. (Music playing) (Applause) >> JENNIFER BAILEY: The card is
titanium and your name is laser etched on it. It's the most
beautifully designed card ever. And your Apple Card is
more secure than others. It has no card number, no CVV,
no expiration, and no signature. (Applause) Of course, if you ever
need that information, it's in the Wallet app. As I noted earlier, you will
receive 3% Daily Cash for purchases made
directly from Apple, 2% Daily Cash for Apple Pay, and
when you make a purchase with this beautiful titanium Apple
Card, you get 1% Daily Cash. (Applause) So that's Apple Card. There's never been a
credit card like it before. Apple Card will be coming to
the Wallet app in the U.S. this summer and we think
you are going to love it. Thank you. Back to you. (Applause) >> TIM COOK: Thanks,
Jennifer. Great! With our hardware,
software, and services, we think that Apple is uniquely
positioned to make the most significant change in the credit
card experience in 50 years, and we can't
wait to get started. Now, let's turn our
attention to the App Store. (Applause) Apps have reshaped the way
that we work, connect, learn, and play. From day one, the App Store has
been a safe and trusted place for users to
discover and download apps. We review every single
app before it goes live. We also have a team of expert
editors creating rich editorial content and curated
collections of the best apps. The App Store has become
the essential destination to discover new apps, to learn more
about the apps you already have, or just to meet the
developers behind them. It's no wonder that the App
Store is now visited by over a half a billion people each week. Now, the most popular category
on the App Store is games. In fact, iOS has become
the largest gaming platform in the world. (Applause) Now, we want to make
gaming even better. To tell you more about
what we have planned, I'm pleased to
bring up Ann Thai, Senior Product Marketing
Manager of the App Store. Ann. (Applause) >> ANN THAI: Thanks, Tim. Many games on the App Store
are not just hits but also cultural phenomena. You know about them regardless
of whether you have played them. They become part of pop culture
like the many Fortnite emotes we have seen on the playing field. And all of this is no surprise
when there have been over one billion people who have
downloaded games from the App Store. (Applause) The App Store supports a vibrant
gaming community of players of all ages and backgrounds from
around the world with a catalog of nearly 300,000 games. The App Store has
both free and paid games. Free games are either supported
by advertising or have in‑app purchases, like Clash Royale. These are incredibly popular and
hundreds of millions of people love playing them. With paid games, customers
pay up front for the full experience, like
Monument Valley 2. These games often have
incredible stories and capture your imagination with their
original art and music. They are some of the
most critically acclaimed games ever made. But competing with free is hard,
so these games haven't been as successful for developers and
they haven't been as easy to find for players. We think we have come up with a
great new way to bring more of these amazing games to more
people than ever before. We are working with some of the
most creative game developers in the world on a new kind of
service designed specifically for games like these, a service
that is giving them the freedom to do the best
work of their lives. We call it Apple Arcade. (Applause) Apple Arcade is the world's
first game subscription service for mobile, desktop,
and living room. With Apple Arcade, we
have carried a collection of brand-new games
that redefine games, and we are not
just curating them, we are backing their development
and our team is working closely with developers to
bring these games to life. We are really
excited about this, and so are the
creators we are working with. Let's hear from
some of them now. (Music playing) >> CHARLES CECIL: It's an
extraordinary time to be writing games. Beyond a Steel Sky is super
ambitious in that it's taking a full, high quality console
game directly to mobile. We are working with the
legendary comic book artist Dave Gibbons who
cocreated and drew Watchmen. The story, character
modeling, graphics, the audio, all of those come together to
create a game play experience that's completely immersive. >> SAM ROSENTHAL: Where Cards
Fall tells a very personal coming‑of‑age story that other
publishers wouldn't take a chance on. We are not shying away
from uncomfortable, formative experiences. We see the characters at school,
we see them at the homecoming dance, we see them have
a fight with their mom. It's really important
for us to be authentic. >> CEDRIC ADAMS: There's no
guns, there's no killing. We're just telling a story. We are almost the complete
opposite of the current market, and most people typically
wouldn't see it unless Apple Arcade existed. >> DENIS MIKAN: We wanted
Lifelike to have a calming effect on players. I'm not aware of another game
that uses swarm behavior as its main game mechanic. This fascinating beauty was
inspired by natural phenomenon. We just simply don't want to be
responsible for adding another layer of chaos into the world. >> BEKAH SALTSMAN: Overland is
a post-apocalyptic road trip strategy game. The cool thing about it is every
time you play, it's different. You never know what people
you're going to meet or what places you're going to go. We're really excited that Apple
was doing this platform because people have iPads,
people have iPhones, and that means bringing a
whole new audience to games. That's awesome. >> MALE SPEAKER: Apple Arcade
is like the perfect avenue for expanding creativity. >> BEKAH SALTSMAN: For us,
it was like, ah, finally, finally someone who gets it. >> DENIS MIKAN: Apple Arcade is
all about giving developers the freedom to come up with really
interesting ideas that could never have been
done by the mainstream. Everything is changing. (Applause) >> ANN THAI: These
developers are some of the greatest storytellers
and artists in the world. From immersive AR to
ground-breaking multiplayer, they are creating games that
have never been possible before. These games are insanely fun
and will appeal to the kid in all of us. And with Apple Arcade, you will
get to play all of these games. With a single subscription, you
will get access to over 100 new and exclusive games that
will raise the bar for what's possible in gaming. You won't find these games on
any other mobile platform or in any other subscription service. So how will you
get to Apple Arcade? Apple Arcade will be a new area
right on the App Store with its own dedicated tab. Rather than pay up
front for each game, your subscription will allow you
to download and play any Apple Arcade game from the App Store. And we will be adding
new games all of the time. With full access to this
amazing collection of new games, you will have the freedom
to try whatever you want whenever you want. You will be able to play Apple
Arcade games across iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV, and
pick up where you left off in a game even if you switch devices. And unlike streaming services,
every game will be playable offline, so you can play
anywhere regardless of your Internet connection. (Applause) All Apple Arcade games
will be all you can play, so all game features,
content, and future updates will be included. There will be no adds and no
additional purchases needed, and parents can manage
kids' access with our screen time features. Like all of our
products and services, we've designed Apple Arcade
to be a great experience. The App Store already works
hard to protect your privacy. With Apple Arcade, we are
taking it even further. Apple Arcade games cannot
collect any data about you nor track any information about how
you play their games without your consent. Also, Apple Arcade will be
curated by our team of expert editors, offer
personalized recommendations, and your family will
be able to enjoy it for no additional charge. (Applause) We really think you are
going to love Apple Arcade, a game subscription
service unlike any other. You will enjoy over 100 amazing
new and exclusive games and more games will be
added all of the time. So, who is ready to see more
of these incredible games? (Applause) Here is a sneak peek of
some of the games coming to Apple Arcade. (Music playing) (Applause) Apple Arcade will be available
this fall in over 150 countries and regions around the world. Pricing and more
details to come. And that's a sneak
peek of Apple Arcade. (Applause) >> TIM COOK: Thank you, Ann. I can't wait until
all of us can play. Now, let's talk about TV. (Applause) For over a decade, we have
been bringing you innovative TV experiences from the first TV
shows that you could download right to your iPod to the
best-in-class cinematic picture and sound quality of
today's Apple TV 4K. We have done it
because we love TV. TV is more than
just entertainment. It's cultural. TV, at its best, enriches our
lives and we can share it with people that we love. Today there is so much to watch
in more ways than ever before. And with so many choices,
sometimes it's hard to know where to start. That's why we
created the Apple TV app. It's one place to easily
discover shows you will love from over 150 streaming
apps across your iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV 4K. In fact, our vision for Apple
TV app is to bring together your favorite shows,
movies, sports, and news, and make them available
on all of your devices, so you can spend less time
looking for something to watch and more time enjoying it. Today we are excited to show
you an all new Apple TV app. And to tell you all about it,
I'd like to invite up Peter Stern, Vice
President of Services. Peter. (Applause) >> PETER STERN: Thanks Tim. Let's start with what you watch. Beginning with movies, all of
the new releases and the massive iTunes movie
catalog, over 100, 000 titles plus your
personal library, are now all built
into the Apple TV app. If you love movies, the new
Apple TV app is now the place for you. Next, if you subscribe to cable
or satellite TV, like Spectrum, DirectTV, or Optimum, or one
of the new Internet Live TV providers, you can now access
all of your sports, news, and network TV right
inside the Apple TV app. For so many people, these cable
bundles are convenient because you can get access to hundreds
of channels for just one price. If you want it all,
there is no better way. But for some of us, the big
bundle is more than we need, so we designed a new TV
experience where you could pay for only the channels
you want, all in one app, with the password
you already have. Watch everything on
demand and ad‑free. Download your shows to
take with you anywhere. Enjoy the highest quality
picture and sound available. And share this great experience
with your entire family. This is how TV should work. (Applause) Now it does with
Apple TV channels. Only the channels you
want on-demand, ad‑free, for the entire family,
and all of it is inside the new Apple TV app. We are launching Apple TV
channels like HBO, Showtime, Starz, Epix, CBS All Access, and
everything else you see here, and we will be adding
even more around the world. So, to recap, whether you
get your TV from a live  streaming service like Prime
Video, Hulu, or ESPN Plus, movies from
iTunes, sports, news, and network TV from cable or
satellite, or shows from HBO, Showtime, and Starz with
the new Apple TV channels, it's all together in one
place, the Apple TV app. And because there is so much
to watch all in this one place, we have redesigned the Apple TV
app to make it even simpler to find what you love. Let's dig in. Your home in the Apple
TV app is watch now. Most of the time we watch TV,
we want to watch our show or tonight's game or maybe finish
the movie we started last night. That's where the up
next row comes in. All of these things you watch,
no matter where they come from, are here in up next. It makes it so easy to pick
up right where you left off. But what do you do when you are
all caught up on your shows? If you know what you want
to watch next, it's easy. Just use Siri. But if you don't know
what to watch, well, that's where the new
Apple TV app really shines. Our expert editors are like
that friend you have that always knows the best shows on TV. Every day they do the work for
you so you can just watch the good stuff. But when it comes to TV,
each of us is unique. That's why the new Apple TV
app is personalized for you. We use advanced Machine Learning
to understand what you like to watch from the subscriptions you
already have so we can help you find your next favorite show. And, of course, the new Apple
TV channels are available too, so when you subscribe to
a channel, like Showtime, everything from that
channel is in one place. It's so easy to browse, and you
can play all of it right inside the Apple TV app, no more
bouncing from app to app. (Applause) Moving beyond Watch Now, we
have also created a new home for movies, so you can buy or rent
iTunes movies like Bumblebee or you can watch Oceans 8 from your
new Apple channel subscription to HBO, all of your
favorite movies are here. The Apple TV app is also
great for sports fans. You can see current
games with live scores, check out tonight's match ups,
and even get notifications when your favorite team is
having a close game. To show you some of the cool new
stuff the Apple TV app can do, I would like to
bring out Cindy Lin, Director of Program
Management. Cindy. (Applause) >> CINDY LIN: Thanks, Peter. Hi, everyone. I am so excited to show
you the new Apple TV app. The app is right
here on my Home screen. Let's dive in. Everything I'm watching
is here in Up Next. I can pick up where I left off
in the Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, watch the next
episode of Project Runway, or finish watching Bumblebee. I get my cable from
Spectrum, and I also have Hulu and Prime Video. It's all right here
in the Apple TV app. There is so much to watch. When I want to
find something new, this is where the app
really helps me out. It's always getting
smarter about what I like. The recommendations in For You
are personalized just for me. I love Sandra Oh, and I
have been hearing so much about this show. I'm definitely adding this
to my Up Next to watch later. One of my favorite features
is this new way to browse TV. Swiping is just
like channel surfing, except every show here is
one I actually want to watch. And trailers play right here. >> JASON MAMOA: My father
was a lighthouse keeper. My mother was a queen. But life has a way of
bringing people together. >> CINDY LIN: I love Jason Momoa
in Game of Thrones and I can't wait to watch Aquaman. There is already so much here
and it's so easy to add even more with Apple TV channels. Everybody has been talking about
the new season of Billions on Showtime and I need
to get caught up. I can start my
free trial right here. It's just a couple of
clicks, and then I'm done. That's it! That was so easy! (Applause) Now, everything from Showtime is
here in the Apple TV app and I can start watching right away. There is nothing else to set up. I can skip the intro to
get right to the action. Okay, no spoilers. I'm going to pick this back
up again later from my Up Next. I have a 5‑year‑old son and
there is a brand-new kids' experience for us. All of my son's
favorite characters are here. There is Chase from Paw Patrol,
Daniel Tiger, and, of course, everyone from Sesame Street. There are so many episodes here,
even the ones that I watched as a kid. And whether we want
to learn something new, be inspired by other kids, or
just let our imaginations run wild, I love that we have a
safe place to explore together. (Applause) So that's a quick look
at the new Apple TV app. It's the best place to watch TV
on all of my devices and I can't wait for you to try it. Back to you, Peter. (Applause) >> PETER STERN: Thanks Cindy. Now, that you have seen
the new Apple TV app, you are going to want it
on all of your screens. You just saw it on Apple TV 4K. It looks and sounds
stunning on iPad. And everything you saw
is amazing on iPhone. So for all of those
moments in between, whether you are on your way to
work or just stealing a moment for yourself, all of your
shows are always with you. You will be able to
get this new experience, including Apple TV channels, on
all of these devices through a software update this May. And I'm so excited to tell you
that for the first time we are bringing the Apple TV
app to the Mac this fall. (Applause) And that's not all. We know you are going to want
this great experience on every screen in your home, so
we are doing something we've never done before. We are bringing the
Apple TV app to Smart TVs. (Applause) We're launching the same great
experience with Samsung this spring, followed by
Sony, LG, and Vizio, all of the biggest
names in Smart TVs, and we are even bringing the
Apple TV app to Roku and Amazon so everyone can have an Apple
TV experience on every screen. (Applause) Today the Apple TV app is
available in ten countries, but we are bringing the all-new
experience to our customers around the world in
over 100 countries. (Applause) The Apple TV app delivers
on all of these principles, including our commitment that
we won't share your personal information with anyone. (Applause) So that's the new Apple TV
app, your apps, movies, cable, the all new Apple TV
channels, all in one place on all of your screens. Back to you, Tim. (Applause) >> TIM COOK: Thank you, Peter. The new features of the
Apple TV app look really great. But we have even more to
contribute to the TV experience. Apple has always tried to
make the world a better place, and we believe deeply in
the power of creativity. Our products help people express
their creativity and to tell their stories because great
stories can change the world. Great stories can
move us and inspire us. They can surprise us and
challenge our assumptions. We feel we can contribute
something important to our culture and to society
through great storytelling, so we partnered with the most
thoughtful, accomplished, and award-winning group of
creative visionaries who have ever come together in one place
to create a new service unlike anything that's
been done before. Apple TV+. (Applause) We have two amazing people that
are running this effort for us, Zack Van Amburg
and Jamie Erlicht, and I'm very pleased to
introduce you to them now and ask them to tell
you all about this incredible new service. Guys. >> ZACK VAN AMBURG: Thanks, Tim. Thank you. Jamie and I are so excited to
be here with all of you today. As Tim said, great
stories can change the world, and that's because
great stories connect us, they connect us to each other,
they connect us to new ideas, and they even connect us
to new worlds and cultures we've never experienced. Now, that's important and it's
powerful and helps connect us to something bigger than
who we are as individuals. At Apple, we know that great
stories begin and end with the incredible
artists who tell them, the artists who are thoughtful
enough and brave enough to share their best story
with us and the world. >> JAMIE ERLICHT: We thought
you would like to meet a few of these exceptional artists as we
begin to share our vision for a new service dedicated to
the best stories ever told. We've asked a few of them to
speak about their inspiration and creative process, because
if we are going to contribute, inspire, challenge
assumptions, and change the world, we need to examine the
art of great storytelling and the mindset of the
greatest storytellers. Have a look. >> STEVEN SPIELBERG: Want me
to help you find your opening? Well, I would do this. I would start with a black
screen and I would put a little speck of light in the
center of the black screen, and I would have the
light grow in intensity, and then like the Big
Bang, it explodes. >> J. J. ABRAMS:
Life often makes no sense. There is something about stories
that gives a sense of order and purpose to the world and allows
us to live other lives than the life we are living. >> STEVEN SPIELBERG: The best
ideas that I've had have come to me when I have
least expected them. They're always intruders, but
they are welcome intruders. >> SOFIA COPPOLA: Once you
get an idea in your head, it just keeps nagging at
you until you express it. >> M. NIGHT SHYAMALAN: That's
the feeling of the idea that it just becomes irrational. There is a woman
sitting in a car in a field. Now I need to know
why she is sitting there. >> RON HOWARD: I begin to
believe that there's something of myself that I can
share with an audience. If I'm thrilled,
that's a good sign. If I'm laughing, that's
a good beginning. >> J. J. ABRAMS: It's the spark. It's the living with the thing. It's the outlining of it. >> SOFIA COPPOLA: I find
writing to be the hardest part. >> RON HOWARD: Writing and
rewriting for months or years. >> M. NIGHT SHYAMALAN: She dies. No, she lives. He dies. >> STEVEN SPIELBERG: The
first draft, the second draft, the third draft, the fourth
draft, the fifth draft, the sixth draft, da‑da‑da‑da,
yadda, yadda, yadda, yadda. >> J. J. ABRAMS: Then you begin
to build the collaboration that will help you go on that voyage. >> STEVEN SPIELBERG: You've got
to find the cast of your dreams. >> FEMALE SPEAKER: For every
character that I decide to do, I envision memories for them. I create the dimensions
of who this woman is. >> REESE WITHERSPOON: Imagine if
you were this person and imagine if you lived in that world. >> RON HOWARD: You have to think
about the environment that the story exists in. How are you going to
create that environment? >> J. J. ABRAMS: What's
the look going to be? What's the tone? What's the palette? How is it going to work? The costumes, the
props, the set design. >> SOFIA COPPOLA:
Little by little, the elements start to
come together and build on each other. >> J. J. ABRAMS: It's
electric and amazing. The thing is becoming alive. >> STEVEN SPIELBERG: You walk
onto the set and you smell this amazing aroma of
sawdust, wood, and plaster. >> JENNIFER ANNISTON: You just
sort of disappear into this fantasy world. >> J. J. ABRAMS: So then you
have to think, well, how are you going
to shoot this thing, because you're not going to
shoot a movie chronologically, so you're often starting
the movie shooting the most dramatic, most painful,
most agonizing scene first. >> RON HOWARD: My anxiety
often starts at about 3:00 in the morning. The wheels have started turning. There is an excitement
and a dread. >> DAMIEN CHAZELLE: You
definitely go in with a very
concrete sense of what you're aiming for,
then you have to be willing to throw it all away. >> HAILEE STEINFELD:
Nothing I'm doing is good. Nothing is working. >> M. NIGHT SHYAMALAN: The shot
goes up and it's not right, and that's, that's torture. >> J. J. ABRAMS: It's not a big
deal when it's just you and a pad of paper, but when it's
countless numbers of talented people who are
all waiting around and the sun is going away. >> SOFIA COPPOLA: You are under
so much time pressure and you are kind of holding your breath. >> M. NIGHT SHYAMALAN:
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick. >> J. J. ABRAMS: The pressure
is on and it's horrifying. >> STEVEN SPIELBERG:
Fear is good. At least for me, it's good. The fear of failure is a kind of
octane that keeps me wanting to stand on the edge of the abyss,
but at the same time not plunge to my career death. >> RON HOWARD: It's all
falling apart and then a new possibility appears. >> J. J. ABRAMS: There are those
moments when the actor is sitting there and she's doing
the thing, the thing that inspired you months,
sometimes years earlier. Everyone is quiet and the crew
is just focused and everyone has done their job to
get you to this moment. Somehow everything is in sync. >> JENNIFER ANISTON: There is
truth pumping through your veins and into the story
that you are telling. >> STEVEN SPIELBERG: There is
no greater moment than that when you feel that you are really
cruising and you are one organism telling one story and
you're all telling it with each other's contributions. Nobody is telling it alone. >> J. J. ABRAMS: The sun
is in the perfect place. Like the birds go right where
you could never - like there are moments where you are
like it's impossible. >> J. J. ABRAMS: Finally,
you wrap the project, and then it goes out into the
world and you hope that all of these decisions
that you were part of, that you collaborated on, it
will move people and touch people in a way that it
seemed like it was inevitable. >> RON HOWARD: Nothing works if
the themes don't connect with the audience. They have to. >> DAMIEN CHAZELLE: Sharing
stories with one another makes
us feel less alone. >> REESE WITHERSPOON:
Everyone deserves to have their story be told. >> OCTAVIA SPENCER: That's what
makes us special is the tapestry of who we are as human beings. >> STEVEN SPIELBERG: To become
involved in someone else's life, that's the idea of
what a story should be. A story should make you
forget your surroundings, it should make you forget
your agenda, your day, and hopefully makes
you forget yourself. (Applause) (Cheers and Applause) >> STEVEN SPIELBERG: Thank you. Well, I'm so
grateful to be here today. This is my first time at Apple. You know, the place where
imagination and technology join forces to change the
world through sight and sound and touch. Now, my first encounter with
science fiction came from an anthology magazine
called Amazing Stories, and this magazine had been
in existence for since 1926. And my father had devoured
it when he was a boy, and when I was a little
kid, he read this to me, and the stories he read me were,
as the title promised, amazing, or so it seemed
to a 5‑year‑old me. And it's relatively easy to
inspire amazement in the head and heart of a child. Kids enter into the booming
confusion of life with a prodigious capacity for
amazement, and that amazement, that capacity is a
human birth right. It's our inheritance. It's how our interaction with
the marvelous world around us gets sparks flying
across our brains. And thanks to the visionary and
inventive folks here at Apple, my Amblin team and I, are
going to be resurrecting this 93‑year‑old brand and offering
to multigenerational audiences a whole new batch of Amazing
Stories and we want to transport the audience with every episode. Like the World War II pilot
whose plane magically travels through space and time from the
past and into the present day. Who will he meet? Can he return? Does he want to? What happens if he doesn't? It's the universal human
trait to search for meaning, so in these
disconnected stories, we think the audience will find
that one compelling narrative that will make the first season
of Amazing Stories into a single thematic experience for them
and I hope for all of you, too. Thank you. (Cheers and Applause) >> REESE WITHERSPOON: Thank you! >> JENNIFER ANISTON: Thank you! Thank you, guys. This is so exciting. Reese and I are so proud to be
a part of this exciting launch with Apple, officially
announcing our new project, The Morning Show. (Applause) >> REESE WITHERSPOON:
So, in The Morning Show, we pull back the curtain on the
power dynamics between men and women in the high-stakes
world of morning news shows. It's a real insider's view into
the lives of the people who help America wake up every day. >> JENNIFER ANISTON: And through
the prism of those under-slept, over-adrenalized people behind
and in front of the camera, we take an honest look at the
complex relationships between women and men in the
workplace, and we engage in the conversation people are a little
too afraid to have unless they are behind closed doors. >> STEVE CARELL: Hello? Am I late? Hi, guys. Hey. >> JENNIFER ANISTON:
Ah, get out here. >> REESE WITHERSPOON:
Yeah. Yeah. >> JENNIFER ANISTON:
Steve Carell. >> REESE WITHERSPOON:
Steve, get over here. >> JENNIFER ANISTON: Hi, Steve. >> STEVE CARELL: Hi. I just, I saw the two of you on
screen up there and I didn't
know if it was my turn or not. >> REESE WITHERSPOON:
Oh, yeah. Okay. >> JENNIFER ANISTON: No, no,
Steve, we have to tell you, we are so thrilled that you
are a part of the show because, honestly, you can't have
an honest look at complex relationships between men
and women with just women. >> STEVE CARELL: Well, I am just
happy to provide the manliness. >> REESE WITHERSPOON: Yes, the
Morning Show is seen through the eyes of two ambitious,
aspirational female characters. >> STEVE CARELL: And
a prominent male. >> JENNIFER ANISTON: Yes. >> REESE WITHERSPOON: Yes,
a prominent male character. Yes. >> JENNIFER ANISTON: Yeah. Steve, why don't you say
something about your character? He's very bold and very dynamic. >> STEVE CARELL: Yes. But even more importantly,
Jen, he's bold and dynamic. He has a lot of gravitas. He is a great listener. >> JENNIFER ANISTON: Yeah. >> STEVE CARELL:
He is also relatable and extremely handsome. >> REESE WITHERSPOON: Yes. >> JENNIFER ANISTON: Okay. >> REESE WITHERSPOON: Extremely. >> STEVE CARELL: His colleagues
love him and America loves him. He also ‑‑ >> REESE WITHERSPOON: He is
surrounded by an exciting ensemble of other characters all
from the very brilliant mind of Kerry Ehrin, our
writer producer. >> STEVE CARELL: She created ‑‑ (Applause) Incidentally, she created a very
bold, dynamic character for me. >> REESE WITHERSPOON: She did. >> JENNIFER ANISTON: Steve, is
there anything else that you want to add? >> STEVE CARELL: No. >> JENNIFER ANISTON: Okay. >> REESE WITHERSPOON: The
Morning Show is a high-velocity thrill-ride in which we pose
questions without easy answers and shine a light on the fault
lines in our society at this very complicated
cultural moment. >> JENNIFER ANISTON: All of
this and the chance for us to collaborate again has brought
me back to television and I'm really excited about it. (Applause) So we can't wait to show
all of you what we have been cooking up. >> REESE WITHERSPOON: So be
on the lookout for The Morning Show. (Cheers and Applause) >> JASON MOMOA: Surprise! Thank you. Woo! I am ‑‑ we are so
thankful to be here. I'm pretty stoked! I'd like to try something
with everyone, so, please, close your eyes
just for a moment. Just close them. I want you to
experience something. Try to think about the
world this way, heard, touched, smelled, sensed,
but without sight. Imagine every human experience
available to you, love, joy, discovery, terror,
despair, and hope. Imagine it was all experienced
this way, heard, touched, smelled, taste
even, but not seen. Now open your eyes. And let me spoil this a little
bit, you have no idea what that
would be like. Neither do I. Being blind isn't something
that can get turned on and off. It's a part of who you are. It's a part of your soul. And now while you are at
it, imagine a world evolved, designed, and built to be
experienced without sight. We did. And it yielded the
world, the world of See. >> ALFRE WOODARD: From the
unfettered imagination of Steven Knight, See takes place in a
world in which the earth was devastated by a virus that left
only a few million survivors, and those survivors,
each and every one of them, emerged blind. Our story begins centuries later
at which point the human race has existed for so long without
sight it's disputed whether such a thing ever existed. In this world, we are
going to have our evil queens, brave heroes, and
thrilling adventure. But beyond the adventure, See
will ask questions you may have already started asking
yourselves just now with your eyes closed. How much of my experience
of the world is visual? Without sight, would
it change who I am? This is a world
constructed unlike any you have ever experienced. See is a journey wherein we may
discover something entirely new about ourselves,
about our world. As a result, we cannot wait for
you to join us on this journey. (Applause) >> KUMAIL NANJIANI: Hi. Thank you. I grew up in Karachi, Pakistan. >> AUDIENCE: Woo woo. >> KUMAIL NANJIANI: Okay. Pakistan is in the house. Hi. What I knew of America, I had
learned from Hollywood movies and American TV Shows. So when I was moving to America
at the age of 18, I was excited. I was excited about the idea
of being dwarfed by skyscrapers that would loom above the
horizon to herald my arrival. Then I landed in Iowa. Okay, Iowa is here too. And I thought this is
very different from the America in movies. You don't -- you guys don't lead
with that America, you know. I had missed the one movie that
would have prepared me for that America, Iowa, Field of Dreams. Did not see that one. I was like this is
false advertising. This is not the
America I was promised. I was one of two Pakistanis
at the college I went to, but I found common
ground with people. My love of Springsteen, their
curiosity about how to say various swear words in Urdu. She could help you out, too. I once made a huge pot of this
Pakistani beef stew called Haleem and I misread the recipe
and put in twice the amount of chili powder. I lost a lot of
friends that day. They didn't, like, die. They just wished they were dead. Eventually, I moved to Chicago,
and I did what every American does, I struggled to pay
rent, fell in love, got jobs, lost jobs, got a cat, burned
food, disappointed my parents, and tried to figure out
what to do with my life. Normal, everyday life stuff. When people defend immigration,
they focus on the exceptionality of immigrants. Albert Einstein
was an immigrant. Joseph Pulitzer
was an immigrant. While those stories are
inspiring and valuable, we wanted to focus on
the immigrants doing everyday life stuff. Little America is an anthology
series inspired by the true stories of
immigrants in the U.S. Here is the thing,
it's not about telling like immigrant stories. These are human stories
that feature immigrants. When you get to know someone and
start to see your struggles and their struggles, your
passions and theirs, your problems and theirs,
they stop being the other. I, along with my partners,
Emily Gordon, Lee Eisenberg, Allen Yang at Epic Magazine,
wanted to make a show that did just that, because, ultimately,
we are all looking for the same thing, food,
home, meaning, love. Like the emotional story of a
young Indian boy living in Utah whose parents achieved the
American dream of running their own motel until they
were suddenly deported. Twelve year old, Kumail, wasn't
going to let his parents' dream
die, so this young boy secretly ran
the motel for the next ten years on his own while simultaneously
plotting his quest to get his parents back to the U.S. Okay, true story. He competed in the national
spelling bee so that he could meet First Lady Laura
Bush and ask for help, and he came in 13th and he
actually got to meet her. He did! (Applause) I know you guys are like 13th
doesn't sound that impressive, but he was running a
motel at the time, too, and he speaks a
whole other language. (Applause) Did Laura Bush help him? Tune in to find out. Little America will cover the
full range of human emotions. Some episodes are funny,
some are romantic, some are thrilling. They feature immigrants from
Iran, Syria, Nigeria, Mexico, and more, and are set all over
America from Texas to Oklahoma to California. The majority of the writers and
directors are either immigrants or the children
of immigrants. Yeah. (Applause) On set, one of our
actors said to Emily, I have been acting for decades,
but I have never gotten to be in every scene. How awesome is that? We hope Little America will help
viewers understand that there is no such thing as the other. There is only us, which is why
at this moment in history we are excited that we get to
tell these stories with Apple. Connecting
humanity is in their DNA. The immigrant dream
is the American dream. Connecting through our
stories will give us a better understanding of each other, an
understanding that allows us to live together, eat
each other's food, maybe learn some fun
new ways of swearing, and that is the
America I was promised. We can't wait for you to
see our Little America. Thank you. (Applause) >> BIG BIRD: Hello there! Ha ha ha. Hi, it’s me. In case you don't know
who I am, I'm Big Bird. I think I'm in the right place
to meet my new friend Cody, but I'm not sure. She gave me
directions to get here. She said, first, turn
right at Hooper's store, then take a left at
Oscar's trash can, and then keep going straight
until you see Apple Park. I love circles, by the way. So, where is she? >> CODY: Here I am, Big Bird. Hi, everybody! >> BIG BIRD: Hi, Cody. >> CODY: Hi, how are you doing? >> BIG BIRD: I'm great. >> CODY: Hi, Big Bird. >> BIG BIRD: Hey, thanks
for helping me get here. >> CODY: That's
what I do, Big Bird. I'm a Helpster, a monster
who loves to help. Hey, I'm glad you are here
because I wanted to tell you and everyone here some
very special news. >> BIG BIRD: Okay,
let's hear it! >> CODY: Yeah? Well, the peeps at Sesame
Workshop and Apple have teamed up to make an incredible new
preschool show starring me. It's called Helpsters. (Applause) >> BIG BIRD: Oh. >> CODY: Yeah. See? Oh, thank you. Oh, gosh. I've never had a livestream
clap for me before. See, helping is my
favorite thing to do. My Helpster friends and I just
love to help anyone with any problem no matter
how large or small, from making instruments for a
band to teaching a friend how to fly their first kite. And you know how we do it? >> BIG BIRD: How? >> CODY: We use the big ideas
behind coding to solve problems. >> BIG BIRD: You don't say. >> CODY: I do say. >> BIG BIRD: Well, do you
think you could help teach me? >> CODY: I already did. You know those
directions I gave you? >> BIG BIRD: Yeah. >> CODY: Well, directions
are one of the building blocks of coding. See, coding
fosters collaboration, critical‑thinking skills, and is
an essential language that every child can learn. By teaching
preschoolers about coding, we are giving them the
opportunity to change the world, world, world, world. You know, in their
own special way. Oh, and did I mention
we also have cool music and funky dance moves? Boy, I want to watch that show. >> BIG BIRD: Oh, and you are
helping kids grow up to be smarter, stronger, and kinder. >> CODY: And more creative, too. We just want to make a
difference in children's lives just like how you and all of
your friends on Sesame Street have done for all of these nice
people when they were kids and continue to do today. >> BIG BIRD: Oh. >> CODY: Yep. >> BIG BIRD: Oh, well,
that's pretty cool. >> CODY: It sure is, Big Bird. Okay, so do you remember
those directions to get home? >> BIG BIRD: I think so. Do you want to come with me? >> CODY: Of course. Let's go. >> BIG BIRD: Okay. Bye‑bye, everybody. >> CODY: Bye, everybody! (Applause) (Cheers and applause) >> J.J. ABRAMS: Hello. Thank you. Thank you. I feel incredibly lucky to be
here today to get a chance to collaborate with Sara whose
music has moved me for years and with Apple is an actual thrill. >> SARA BAREILLES: A couple of
years ago I ran into JJ and we talked about my experiences
as a singer/songwriter, the struggles, the
drama, the insanity, and he asked if I had ever
thought about creating a series about that world. I had not at all. But I heard myself say,
yes, JJ, of course, I have. >> J.J. ABRAMS: Sara
Bareilles is a liar. That's the message I hope
to communicate today. We brought in Jesse Nelson,
Sara's writing partner on the musical Waitress. We talked about music, but
also about that terrifying, thrilling, absurdly wonderful,
and often embarrassing time, when as a young person you
venture out into the world for the first time. >> SARA BAREILLES: So this was
the beginning of our new series Little Voice, a funny, romantic
show about the reality of what is hard and wonderful and
transformative about being a young woman who has to
ultimately find her voice as an artist but also as a
person through music. >> J.J. ABRAMS: Sara, of
course, might be lying to you. >> SARA BAREILLES: Okay. I'm not lying. The main character is a
promising flawed young woman, a musician living in New York in
and around a vibrant community of young hopeful
artists, family and friends, soulmates and band mates,
learning to find herself and her own true voice. >> J.J. ABRAMS: Anyone who has
ever given everything they have to go after a dream will feel
like this show was written for them, and how lucky for the
series that Sara is not just a creator and producer
but also composer. >> SARA BAREILLES: The
theme song says it all. (Applause) >> SARA BAREILLES: (Singing) It's everything I am
and what I'm not and all I'm trying to be. This is the part where I spit it
all out and you decide what you think of me. I'm not trying
to be complicated. I'm never waiting
to get the last laugh. But I've been handing
out benefits of the doubt, and I'd like a little bit back. It's just a little voice. And if you're listening,
sometimes a little voice can say the biggest things. It's just my little voice
that I've been missing. Looking over the precious
moments, it hurts, don't it? They can cut both ways. So my savior of
self-defense taught me to sing what I can't say. It's just a little voice. And if you're listening,
sometimes a little voice can say the biggest things. It's just my little voice
that I've been missing. It's just my little voice
that I've been missing. (Applause) >> ZACK VAN AMBURG:
That was beautiful. Incredible. Thank you, Sara. Sara Bareilles. As you can imagine, we are
honored to be working with such amazing and talented people,
and that's just the beginning. We've partnered with the most
accomplished storytellers as well as a new generation of
the most exciting voices who together will define Apple TV+
as the destination with the highest quality originals. (Applause) The original shows and movies
will intellectually challenge and thrill, define and redefine
our expectations, inspire us, make us laugh, transform our
mood and brighten our day, but make us believe
anything is possible, from documentaries to dramas,
from kids to comedies, the highest
quality of storytelling in one single place. This is Apple TV+. (Applause) (Music playing) >> MALE SPEAKER: Stand by three. Stand by one. Make your move. >> FEMALE SPEAKER: Seven. >> FEMALE SPEAKER 2: Ready? >> FEMALE SPEAKER: Six. >> FEMALE SPEAKER
2: Yeah, I'm ready. >> FEMALE SPEAKER: Five,
four, three, two, one. >> JASON MOMOA: This is
where we build our new home. (Cheers and Applause) >> ZACK VAN AMBURG: It's great. Thank you. Thank you. So, that's a first
look at Apple TV+. It's not just
another streaming service. It is the destination where the
world's greatest storytellers will bring their
best ideas to life. And you will be able to
experience all of these original shows and movies right on
the dynamic new Apple TV app. And the TV app will deliver
Apple TV+ across all of your Apple devices and the
biggest screen in your life, on Smart TVs. So here is a few more details. Apple TV+ is an ad‑free
subscription service. It's on-demand,
available online and offline. Everything is downloadable. The best in entertainment with
exclusive original movies and shows, with new
additions every single month. It's available in
100-plus countries. It's a global service. And it's all starting this fall. Apple TV+ will define
commitment to quality storytelling, all in
one place, on every screen in your life. >> JAMIE ERLICHT: We are so
excited to share our vision of Apple TV+ and can't wait for you
to experience it for yourself. Thank you, and back to Tim. >> ZACK VAN AMBURG:
Thanks, everybody. (Cheers and Applause) >> TIM COOK: Thank you. Love it! Thank you, Zack and Jamie. Apple TV+ looks incredible and
we think that it will encourage new ways of
looking at the world. This is just a sneak
peek, the beginning of something very exciting. The opportunity to work with all
of these exceptional artists is truly inspiring. Each will bring their own
unique perspective to the stories they tell. Now, we have one more remarkable
storyteller to share with you this morning, one whose voice
illustrates how powerful stories can change lives
and change the world. (Music playing) (Applause) >> OPRAH WINFREY: Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you. Hi, everybody! Thank you. (Cheers and Applause) Okay. Hi. There has never been a
moment quite like this one. We have this unique opportunity
to rise to our best selves in how we use and choose
to use both our technology and our humanity. We are all at a crossroads where
we get to decide if we want to reach beyond the borders of
our heart and mind to face the daunting challenges of our time. Each of us comes to this earth
with a deep potential that yearns to be fulfilled
with a love to be set free. We all crave connection. We search for common ground. We want to be heard, but we
also need to listen, to open, be open, and contribute in order
to harness our hopes and dreams and to heal our divisions. That's why I have
joined forces with Apple. (Cheers and Applause) Because they are the
company that has reimagined how we communicate. I've joined in order to serve
this moment because the Apple platform allows me to do
what I do in a whole new way, to take everything I've learned
about connecting to people to the next level. Because they are in a
billion pockets, y'all, a billion pockets. The whole world has got
them in their hands, and that represents a
major opportunity to make a genuine impact. So I am proud and honored to
be a part of this new platform where I can connect with
people around the world to share meaningful ways to
create positive change. My intention is to illuminate
consciousness and to build greater awareness through
compelling conversations with newsmakers, with
leaders, with artists, with people in
all walks of life. I want to reach that sweet spot
where insight and perspective, truth and tolerance
actually intersect. So I have two documentaries
in the works right now, one exploring the toll of
sexual harassment, assault, and violation in the workplace. The working
title is Toxic Labor. The other, yet unnamed,
multipart series focuses on mental health and how the
scourge of depression and anxiety, post‑traumatic
stress, addiction, trauma and loss is just
devastating lives daily across the globe. And what I know is if
we do our jobs right, we are going to replace shame
and we are going to replace stigma with wisdom, with some
compassion, and with honesty. (Applause) And now for what
I love the most. For me, there is nothing more
thrilling than being transported by a brilliant book. Nothing. The only thing actually more
gratifying than an extraordinary read is being able to share
that experience with others, and we are going to do just
that by building the biggest, the most vibrant, the
most stimulating book club on the planet. (Applause) It is a club --
listen to this -- imagine, where Apple Stores stream a
conversation with the author and me live across all
devices, across all borders, uniting people to stories that
remind us that no matter who you are or where you are
from, every man, woman, and child looks up in
awe at the same sky. So I want to literally convene a
meeting of the minds connecting us through books. For as long as I can remember, I
have had this dream that for us all to someday realize that
deep potential that we are each born to. It abides in every soul. I know this to be true. And my deepest hope is that we
all humans get to become the fullest version of
ourselves as human beings, to join in the mission and
vision for our common good, to leave this world
more enlightened, kinder, and better than we found it,
and to move together one billion plus strong into a
future of our own design all connected through Apple. (Applause) Thank you. Thank you. >> TIM COOK: Thank you, Oprah. (Cheers and Applause) Thank you. I will never forget this. All right. Okay. Oprah joins these
amazingly passionate and award-winning artists. These are people who we
admire for their unique voices, incredible
creativity, and wonderfully
diverse perspectives. They have impacted
our culture, society, and we are so excited and so
humbled to be working with them. We can't wait to hear all of the
incredible stories that they are going to tell. What a fun morning! (Cheers and Applause) From everything
we've shared with you, you can see how important these
services are for us and for all of the ways they extend the
experiences of our customers even further. They entertain, inspire,
inform, and enrich our lives. Because at Apple, the customer
is and always will be at the center of everything that we do. (Applause) Now, before I close, I'd like
everyone from Apple that worked so hard in making today possible
to stand up so that we can recognize you. (Applause) They've sacrificed a lot
to get us to this day, and I sincerely thank you. It's amazing the privilege of a
lifetime that I have to be able to work with all of them. I want to thank
everyone for coming. I want to thank all of the
artists that came out today and shared time with
us, and most of all, thank you to all of the folks
watching, our customers. Thank you! Bye‑bye! I'm just fascinated by the human condition is making music or not you hit it on the head with the human condition in creating art on one with you there so what's great to see you man congratulations it's exciting I mean it's such a tasteful sounding recording sheet it's the arrangements and I mean talk about giving you space to perform and just extend your vocal ability which is everyone already know is just like you're the best at what you do but thank you sounds so effortless I don't know it just sounds like you're in a super comfortable place locally on this record I appreciate that yeah I'm getting into it like I was just I mean we can't wait you want to wait to to get this on camera I just feel like we're recording right are you recording I'd rather just stop and I really have a big introduction yeah cool I like that like you said I feel like I'm in a cool vein but I haven't really this album is super it's just not very deep you know I didn't go I didn't go there like that you know I mean I didn't go super deep with it thank you the last two or three years which have led up to this album there's been some really significant change in your life and the album being called changes focuses on one and we're gonna get to a place of happiness and bliss album is a happy album I mean it's really you know it's it's it feels to me like a musical tribute to your relationship but I want to kind of keep the timeline off in 2017 and I I always feel like there's a point with you Justin way you give so much then you've you've got to a point you've got to stop but it's like the train is running you know what I mean so it has to stop in a dramatic fashion why did you stop the tour in 2017 and and what was the reason for that I was really tired emotionally physically and I was sick and I didn't realize I was sick so I had like epstein-barr which is like it's called mono and then I have Lyme disease so it was that it was it was just you know the exhaustion of just being on tour and then it was like it was just everything compounded I think to be honest how did you feel when the tour came to an end I mean it didn't really come to an end I was supposed to do a bunch of stadiums but you know I once the American lie or the European lag or wherever I came from last was done I was like this is it for me I mean I pushed through you know the path the last month or two and I you know I couldn't believe I pushed through that so when they were like you know we got to still do stadiums I was like this is not gonna be good I'm not gonna be able to make it through that and it's just no it won't work and I'm someone who pushes pushes pushes until it's like you know so it's like the last straw so I just couldn't do it you knew instinctively that you something was going on and with your physical yeah I knew there was something not right because I was doing everything right on tour I mean I wasn't you know I was keeping to myself I was keeping on as much of a structured schedules I could I was doing the ice baths every day I was eating salmon twice a day like I was doing the right thing to try to take care of my body and it was just like nothing was just felt depleted and felt all the time so I was like you know and then that that took an emotional toll on me so I was like you know I just didn't know what the hell was going on how have you adapted to that experience knowing now that you have Lyme disease and how was it adjusted your lifestyle and how you move forward and what changes have you noticed I think I'm just making sure that I am doing the right treatments for doing the right IVs and all that sort of stuff taking the necessary precautions necessary to not get any worse I guess listen to Hayley when she says she feels that I'm rundown and it's good to have her as you know checks and balances she can let me know what I'm like all right you're looking depleted right now and it's clear to anyone who hears this album and also to anyone who takes an interest in your life as a fan that the two of you have found you know a really important bond and and that this marriage is has been a hugely important development in your life it's been a really big reason why I'm coming back and the end I'm successful at this I think she is definitely the reason there'd be no story without her there B no she just ties it all together I mean she giving me substance to talk about she's the person that I'm learning to you know love unconditionally start a family with so you know regardless if I sell another record I mean I have a lot of peace just knowing that I have the rest of my life to build a relationship with a solid foundation trust and patience and all the things that go into building a healthy relationship when I listen to the sort of what's being said from either of you it's been documented and that in the series but also what you've said it sounds like both of you to some degree knew it was right but you were both had to go into in your own way confirm or qualify that that was the case right how did you know and there's a song on the album which is which really refers to that which is that that's what real love is you know yeah how did you kind of know I'd let her know prior to the tour when we were hanging a lot I said listen I'm still really hurt and still trying to figure out my way and I'm not ready to make a commitment to you in a way that you know I just don't want to say something and do the opposite because I just don't I was at the point where I'd you know I'd done that in the past and I just was like honest with her it was like you know I I'm not in a place to you know be faithful and all this sort of stuff that I wanted to be you know but I just wasn't there yet and what was hurting you at the time you said you were still hurt I was just hurt from my previous relationship I think I still was dealing with a lot of unforgiveness and all that sort of stuff so to be honest I don't think I even knew what I was really struggling with at the time I don't think I knew I was dealing with unforgiveness I was just an in-place where I knew I didn't want to like tell her one thing and like you know I felt like she respected me at the time and I had a lot of respect for her um and so I just didn't want to like say something and then she'd see me off doing some other thing and so but either way she loved me and seeing me with other people hurt her and so with that being said she went out and did things that hurt me and so it was just this hurt I've heard her she hurt me and then before tour we just really stopped talking I was really upset and rather than you know before that in my previous relationship I went off and just went crazy and went wild just was you know being reckless this time I took the time to like really build myself and focus on you know me and try to make the right decisions and all that sort of stuff and yeah I got better and so she would reach out to people that were like that we knew checking on you and check-in and she would get like these the eat here right you'd hear like how he's doing so well and she would be so pissed off because she's like he's not doing well without me like just you know normal like right like normal facts right and yeah yeah and so wish you would hear this right and you'd hear this and I and it would just be you just be like why he's doing well like but in a way you're kind of trying to get bit up because you recognize this something that is unresolved here than the weird way I'm right right right I just didn't know what the heck was going on and so I really took a deep dive in my faith to be honest I just went deep into like I believed in Jesus but I never really like you know when it says following Jesus is actually turning away from sin and so there's no what it talks about in the Bible it's like there's no obedience there's no faith without obedience so it's like I had had faith about like I believe Jesus died on the cross for me but I never really implemented it into my life I never like was like I'm gonna be obedient so I was like I wasn't sleeping around I wasn't doing a lot of stuff I just was kind of by myself how did you make who helped you come to that because I'm sure there were a lot of and I don't mean this in a judgmental way it's just humanity anyone's on their own journey there are a lot of people who are practicing one belief or another but as you say it's different when you when you say it as opposed to actually acting with in its its its guidelines which are there to give you ultimate focus right on what's important so when did you decide to actually move within the guidelines and how did you find yourself away from yeah I believe in Jesus but I'm gonna drink or do drugs or sleep around or what all these other distractions how did you get out of that world what was the turning point for you I think it was my perception of who Jesus really was you know uhm I'd had really bad examples of Christians in my life who would say one thing and do another so they were there my direct example of who Jesus was that's why you didn't take it seriously I didn't take it as seriously because I didn't have a good example oh yeah and so I think the more I I really just really looked at the character of who Jesus really was did you grow up in a Christian house I grew up um in a in a Christian household yeah but my mom was um I mean she was really hurt growing up I mean she had so many things going on in her life so she was navigating her faith journey for me it was just confusing could she say one thing and then like she would say well you're forgiven but then I'd do something bad or whatever was supposedly bad but then I she make me feel ashamed for it so it's like well if Jesus forgives me then why am I feeling why are you making me feel bad for doing something like obviously there's like a form of like we should we got to make sure we keep our kids accountable and punish our kids so that they learn from their mistakes but like if there's this God named Jesus who died for our sins so that we don't have to live in shame then why it was just things like that that would make me really question like who is this Jesus guy and I didn't really take a deep look into who he was yeah it's tough I mean I get it like this hey man our parents do the best they can and I've been through my own you know situations where in front of that things that have affected my life choices but at some point you got to come to a decision you got to take responsibility for your own perception of those situations right otherwise you run around just blaming everybody and that's an entitled situation it entitles you to behave however you want you know what I mean we say you know I guess that's what I was getting at when I was talking about those those tough years in a way you were punishing yourself because you didn't have the answers right I think so that's a good way to put it yeah I think that I was just yeah living in this shame living in all this sort of stuff of my past and I wasn't able to move on but the more I looked at so now I'm not doing no way I look at my relationship with God and with Jesus is I'm not trying to earn God's love by doing good things God has already loved me for who I am before I did anything to earn and deserve it it's a free gift by accepting Jesus and just giving your life to him and what he did is the gift the forgiveness is the thing that we look at him you know I'm gonna worship You God because you gave me something so good and so you lived that life of like I don't want to cheat on my wife not because it's the right thing to do but because I don't want to hurt her see the difference there that is love yeah it's putting the well-being of someone that you care about ahead of your own fallibilities in your own exact previous baby exactly and what's you know what's out there exactly yeah totally yeah okay can I ask you a tough question before we focus on the future and how bright things look do you think that if you hadn't redefined what Jesus was and reclaimed it in to something that was worthy of practice for you which then led you on a path of reconciliation with your wife do you think the person that you either you of then was on a path of self-destruction do you feel that you were honest oh you were self-destructing oh for sure yeah I would have first shared 100% yeah why never say it would have been it would have been no hobo no it was bad it would have been yeah I don't know if I'd be alive for sure it was dark really dark so I'm very very grateful to have influences in my life that have played a huge part in me seeing their relationship with Jesus and their relationship with their wives and their relationship with their kids and saying that's what I want and striving after that so that's I was thinking too it's not obviously you know when we want to be successful in certain things there's things we have to work hard at but like striving for God's love or gods its approval or people's approval it's like gods told me he said I mean I don't hear from God audibly but um I feel like gods you know when he sees us he he's not this God that people a lot of people think that it's like judgmental and he's God that uh that accepts us for who we are and loves us through our our pain and through our heart dirt Jesus wasn't this religious elite guy that you know came to but he was he was in the dirt and he found me in my dirt and pulled me out and that's why my story that's why I'm not afraid I don't want to I want to talk about without forcing that into people's I never want to be someone's trying to persuade anyone to believe in what I believe I think God persuades people but I want to definitely tell my story so that if if that resonates to anybody that they can uh hopefully learn from it he's 2020 going forward into a new decade and I think about from 2008 nine when it first started for you right through I mean you work non-stop and that was a decade in full visibility of the world yeah yeah I definitely have grown up in front of the head of the world for sure but there's nothing I mean just even thinking now I mean what we're doing right now is we are building or building a relationship well you and I are doing right now is building trust we're building huh you know this isn't just I mean people will see this and look at is that as an interview but what we're doing is we're just two men sitting down talking about life and the human condition so when you first started and you said that I was like okay this is gonna be this is gonna be good well for me you know music comes from somewhere right and we always have to remember that maybe it comes from this youthful naivety and this desire to escape something and then you get out there in front of the world and then it comes from a place of wanting more of it yeah and a desire to continue to Phil this kind of bucket right cause it right tastes good all this stuff in there's this energy this attention is fame right yeah it validates you exactly I mean just think about how young I was and so impressionable and you have everybody telling me how good how awesome I am at all times you know I'm like it was it was just insane and so it's like how do you yes I taking care of putting a kid in the room with that with the picnic table full of nothing but sweets right and just saying I'll be back in two days exactly exactly and I'm glad you said that because it's like I just want people to understand like and get that perspective of like my of my life because I think there's a lot of people you know that just have this now see comments and stuff and I really try not to read them but I find myself in a wormhole sometimes show us human betcha but um but just seeing like you know don't be talking about my issues or my problems and stuff in there like oh man cry me a river and your rolls-royce you know what I mean it's like I want people that kind of understand the you know the psychology behind why I could have I potentially could have you know problems in my life so yeah thank you for being here and helping me tell that story I mean I like to go there it's my thing yeah me too yeah I appreciate that I think it's important not just for I mean for me it's about trying to get information that helps break down the stigma that artists should be grateful for everything that they have we should be great for everything we have just when you wake up every morning with our eyes open for obvious reasons exactly but I just go through their own struggles and um and I think that we need to acknowledge and accept that thank you for saying that thank you when did the fire to make music come back because to pick the timeline up again it's sort of your off tour and you realize that you still haven't dealt with certain things right yes 2017 and did you get head again were you slammed again by these kind of unresolved emotions and feelings did you have questions when you came off tour that you still don't have answers for I got off tour in yeah there was still there was just there was this feeling of unresolved things in my life I took the time to resolve some things in my life some some relationships get some healing did you go to therapy work through some healing yeah I did I think it's important that we express our feelings and find that place I think a lot of people I think at one time I felt like who is this person to give me advice you know like what does he know about and I just I've moved five just grown to mature past that and just know that like it's just it's helpful when did you realize that it was time for you to reconnect with Hailey and that you had gotten to a place when you knew that you could potentially actually pursue something substantial I just felt there was a lot of resolution in my life I'd seen her at an event and I'd uh I'd seen her with a baby and something just clicked and it was like wow she's the one I'd kind of decluttered some of my past and I was able to see really clearly and I just seen her across the room she was holding a baby and I just seen the nurturing look in her eyes toward this baby um and I was like I want the mother of my chosen to look at a baby the way that she was and she just the way she was carrying in I just seen something so special and I just was like I want that and I knew that she couldn't offer that to me yeah it was a great story thank you how quick was it after that it would seem pretty quick was very quick couple months later I pop the question and then it was a couple months later all right we got married you nervous before you pop the question I was I mean that's a big commitment and my parents were never married so I never had that uh I never got to see what that really looked like so I'm like can I even do this don't even know what it looks like to do this but I just felt like God was saying I'll show you you know I'll show you how to do it and just you know just trust so I just trusted him and just let him you know lead the way and committed to her and I didn't realize your parents were married yeah my parents weren't married no that's a huge step to take given that the situation from which she came there's no kind of my oh god yes no no nothing my dad is now married and he's doing an awesome job and I'm really proud of him you had a place of honesty now with your parents can you sit down with your dad when the time when you need to when you need answers perhaps you're not sure why you're thinking certain things or your behavior isn't in line with your actual desires what you want to be can you talk to your parents can you try to untangle that to be honest I think there's levels of you know what I think our relationship is ready to handle at this moment where they're at in their journey with you know their faith and where they're at with in their life and where I'm at I just think you know just I want them to play a role in my life and that's pretty simple just be my mom and dad and I think it's just taking me I mean I'm really in the process of doing that right now so it's really kind of still you know I'm still learning that how to do all that and still learning how to trust people oh yeah for sure I mean um I think boundaries to be honest is like key you know understanding like there's people that play certain roles in my life and kind of just uh let them play that role and not give them access to certain parts of my life and that's something you have to do not only as a for your own emotional well-being but I think as a business leader as well you know in something I'm learning I've made some mistakes over the past year to just scooters over there probably laughs and just um I do try I have a problem with trust but then there's areas of like I I do trust people a little too much so trust me sometimes I'm just working through just kind of trying to figure out all that sort of stuff people who take advantage do you feel like people are taking advantage of you in the past oh yeah for sure yeah people take advantage of course but she's kind of trying to figure out how to she's how to navigate being married I'm frigging married down and I got the best wife in the world she supports me through so much I'm really honored to be her husband and I just really have made a whole album about it yeah and there's more to come I mean I want to continue to write about what it looks like to be it's so you know this is an album I wrote in the first year of our marriage you know so it's like it's so fresh and there's you know there's no there's so much more to learn about commitment and you know building trust and foundation I'm just I'm looking forward to continuing to build and make music that's gonna reflect that this was great about changes it's a honeymoon record yeah yeah it's a kind of human record yeah exactly you know it would be sort of dissing genuine to start diving deeper into that situation when you're just learning about it at the beginning things are ages yeah so I think I think I'm like I'm excited about this but I'm just like there's so much more there's so much deeper levels I'm excited to go to which is fun you know it gives me something to look forward to I think in the past I was so caught up in all of like the bad things in my life that I just I wasn't able to really take take a second and really appreciate all the all the little things but yeah I'm excited it's gonna be it's gonna be good I asked a question about when you sort of felt the fire to want to make music again because it's something I know you're 100% committed to so when did you didn't know you wanted to get in the studio I'm feeling spired I think again I was like dealing with a lot of fear a lot of like um just was afraid of like at that point just even the process what am I gonna talk about again you know is it gonna be received you know I'm starting to compare with other artists and I think when I went on stage with ariana grande you know I seen the reaction of how people reacted when I went on the stage it was like okay um he gave me a kind of like a boost of confidence and reminded me because it'd been so long since I've been on the stage just kind of reminded me what I was this is what I this is what I do this is what I'm good at and I don't either away from it I was like yeah I was running away you know I think a lot of us need to take that you know when something's hard it's almost like we need to run towards the the pain and run towards the hurt rather than run away from it and I think you get kind of healing when it comes to that it was a great moment when you came face-to-face or not really cuz that you were wearing a mask Andrea but you came face to face with Billy Eilish in her own way albeit in a different era dealing with this very very public explosion of success and of attention to and like by the way like even more now like he was so quick yeah she's she's crazy she's a superstar superstar right so yeah you say you're there and you see her and you see the way she's reacting to you and I wonder what was going through your minds I've never had a chance to ask you that cuz I know what was going through their mind because I never chance to ask her there it was pretty clear in the video that's going through and why she turned even what was going through your mind when you wreck it when you when you saw that kind of reaction and and also now the knowledge that you were just coming out of that space yourself I wanted to protect the moment you know I don't know how many opportunities I'm gonna get you know we never know how many opportunities we're gonna get with anybody I mean just I'm tearing up thinking about it just with the COBE situation you know um just never know um and so I just wanted to be a good example um you know and yeah um did you feel protective of her yeah I definitely feel protective of her um it was hard for me being that young and being in the industry you not knowing where to turn and everyone you know telling me they love me and you know just turn their back on you in a second um so yeah it's it's hard because I want her to know that you know she can count on me but at the end of the day I don't want to never gonna force myself to be in relationship with her it has to be natural right so I just kind of you know let her do her thing and if she ever needs me I'm gonna be here for her but yeah just protecting those moments because people take for granted uh encounters and yeah so um yeah I just I just want to protect her you know I don't want her to to lose it I don't want her to you know go through anything I went through I don't wish that upon anybody so um yeah if she ever needs me um I'm just a call away do you realize how important your story is and the fact that you're sitting here today telling it man I mean I I have to say thank you because someone who's really every time I have a conversation with someone who's been through this unique type of experience and just I'm searching for some kind of truth that can help right in fact you're sitting here today and being so honest and open it's really important and I just want to share that with you man it's like this is you're right this isn't an interview this is an opportunity for you to help others yeah and that's got to give you purpose even beyond the making of music or technology yeah I'm not thinking about anything but being present in this interview with you you know let's say that's we got right now so we go in we got a story to tell we got either we're gonna be here and we're gonna be authentic and honest and real or we're gonna bullsh and I just I've done that for years and I'm just I was to be an exhausting I mean it really is and so I I just come I just I commend you for going there and asking the tough questions and the things that people don't want to talk about and they don't want to go there because it's just it's revealing and it's it's hard but uh you know this is these are the conversations that are gonna bring change and bring you know a level of consciousness to people that can say I need to really take a look at myself where am i I and you know if Justin's able to be vulnerable where with where where he's at then you know I can do the same thing you know people have putted me on a pedestal I didn't ask for that you know I obviously I love making music but you know there's a lot of people that love making music and they're not you know they're not in the position that I am so you know a lot of that is not you know I can't say that I put myself in this position I'm just trying to steward that wisely Stewart my relationships wisely I want people to take a look at my story and and just hopefully the you know my the my words can can make a difference you chose to make an album that is flows in a really fluid tasteful way and gives you space to really sing and really hyper focus as we said before on the honeymoon phase of your marriage and you're working with poohbear again yeah which is great because you trust him yeah and you got great chemistry and you open the doors some really keen collaborators as well how did you pick him how did you decide who's gonna be on and be off for Tolkien we told quavo Travis kailani yeah that's crazy I mean it's like I look at people who I you know I admire and I I'd love to hear more of their stories and get to know them a little bit more but uh I think they're authentic we were where they're at in their careers and in their their life and you're gonna be a fan yeah I love them I love their music Ewan came on Deary jumped out of me because I was talking about her tongue he's so good and I love you a vocal telling it when you sing and you're in the sweet spot with Pooh Bear I think there's very few if any one who can get to that place and and just talk about that experience of working with kailani on that track and why you chose her I just like you said I think it's a major the major thing is tone mom I just I love her tone and I just think she's honest and and I think that just goes such a long way being authentic it she's a straight talker from where I haven't spent much time with her but I was out to dinner with her the other night and I just felt like he actually seemed like she was pretty authentic she talked to me about like wow that what you talked about in the he was like inspiring because you know it's it's it's scary to kind of show that stuff you know show the hard stuff who in heaven's name is clever and how come for a second me and now something that was post yeah so it's actually I think he signed a post but it's this guy who I found on the internet just seeing him on Instagram and I was like this guy's tone is crazy yeah and he just has this vibe that's just insane and I just love it sort of unchecked and a little rugged on the roads raw and it's friggin just like you can just feel the pain through the music you can feel just emotion raw emotion and I just think it's it's powerful have you got that project in you at some point in the future we're dialing into some really interesting and really powerful human stuff here and this album is a great document to the beginning of a new era for you but do you feel like every day you get closer to making that album that's picks up with purpose left off but goes even further uh yeah I mean I was just in the back there and I literally just came up with the title to my album but I don't know if I'm gonna share right now that's okay it just felt like yeah there's there are so many deeper levels of you know I don't just want it I wouldn't want to talk about you know I think love is you know the foundation of what humanity's built off of but but and with that being said I just think there's so many you know issues in society and things that I'm eventually gonna want to just speak about and write about and in justices and people being marginalized and overlooked and things of that nature I think that's definitely something I'm gonna definitely be going into but I think it's just it's all timing and I think what comes priority first is that lady over there and building my relationship with her because I think she teaches me about all that sort of stuff like what do you what is she really taught what are some of the key kind of growths that you've experienced by being in a relationship like I think she just teaches me just to I mean there's so much I mean patience is a big thing at the end of the day it's like I chose to be with her forever so understanding that yeah I don't know just patience is a big big thing as a patient yeah and we both have I think everybody is a tendency like you said a human condition everybody's can be a patient and the big stick and I gotta ask it because there's you know there's this baby sounds on the record and there it's like really it's it's cool hearing those and I wonder kind of where you've you stand or where how you feel about starting a family and in particular coming from a family that was unorthodox in an environment that wasn't normal or whatever normal family is how you feel about starting your own I want to start my own family in due time I just I want to enjoy being married for a little bit go on tour be married enjoy traveling with just us build more of our relationship and I think yeah that is definitely the next step for sure what kind of father do you sort of want a baby think like what's important to you you know what I mean like oh well great question what do you not want to be that's a good question too I you know I just want to be led by like I said before I'm I'm a Jesus follower and I just want to be led by when you accept Jesus he says it now you walk with the Holy Spirit so I think I just want to be led by by the Holy Spirit so you got a tour I'm going to tour yeah how do you feel about that after the way he felt at the end of the last tour and are you excited I guess you wouldn't be gone tour if you weren't hahaha yeah I'm definitely excited I'm excited to to travel again we've established so much and figured out what's not important and what is important so it's like money's gonna come and it's great and I'm gonna be able to provide a really amazing life for my family which is incredible um but just understanding the priorities I mean like here we are you know we got a lot of people who aren't making as much money as I am on tour you know dancers band all these sort of things I think creating an atmosphere where everybody feels I was telling scooter this the other day where everybody feels heard valued respected and that their goals are you know obviously he's matching with my goals you know and and so that we can work on creating an atmosphere that's gonna be conducive for them you know building their families and building their life and you know for so long it's like there's when you have these other things that you feel are gonna fulfill you whether it's money or success you you're so focused on the outcome that you're you're just not working on how do we get there is this gonna be sustainable you know the tour became so dysfunctional because you got I mean I was talking about this with Nick the other day you got all these people that everyone starts off good on tour everyone starts off a family but then by the end of the tour everybody's got their cliques everybody's because we're not creating you know we're not reminding everybody the focus in the mission and the goal so I think taking that time that I was you know immature in the past and not ready to do that because I just things were more important taking that time to you know have those weekly meetings and be leader needs to be leader exactly to be a leader that's it do you nail it on the head there just lead which I you know I never like you said before like I said before it's like my family life was dysfunctional when I was younger so like it's just been hard to understand what that really looks like but you you've hit on the head being a leader you and your fans have had the most incredible journey and ride and and the level of passion and and the level of loyalty that they show you over the years has been incredible to witness from the outside now that you have a chance to be a leader not just to your band but also to your fans in a weird way right because I know that there have been times when that's probably scared you even or as caught you off-guard that level of attention it's hard to process and I wonder sort of how you feel as you're growing and maturing about having fans and what that concept feels like yeah the concept [Music] it's just so different than you know when I was younger I mean I just it's confusing when you're young because that person loves me what also you come you're coming from a place where you're again getting back to your family which is where it all begins we start our journey somewhere with some people right and we don't ask for that they doing the best they can and you have to process that information and move forward and when you're faced with this adoration and this love but you're not quite sure what love is mm-hmm there you go that's big what we're touching on is big right now this is big it's big this is big this is big I don't even think people know how big this is yeah what is what is love I mean love is patient love is kind love doesn't Envy love doesn't boast love in the self seeking love as an arrogant love is you know what Haley and I are doing every day is waking up in the morning and making the decision to you know we have all these everyone has selfish desires you know everybody has bad thoughts and in but just pushing those aside and saying I'm knocking that mmm I'm not gonna indulge in that because I have something you know you give me something that I I want more than that those things and like you say acknowledging that they existed acknowledging them I started the song was it yeah I wasn't right I wasn't doing that before I don't think I wasn't acknowledging them I just was like pretending that they weren't there using them and then and then you know comes with that self-righteousness I'm doing look at me how good I'm doing because I'm not doing those things self-righteousness and are you pretending the epitome of what I hate but it's something that I started doing because I'm like well I'm saying no to all this other garbage and I'm doing the right thing so look I'm a good guy yeah and then people are like what you know like who are you to say you know I mean it's like we're not really good at the end of the day at the core I don't believe I believe the humans are good and then people might you know twist this and make me seem like I'm saying humanity's not good I don't know waitress I just feel like at the core I fight everyday temptation and things that you know are instinctive to do whether it's you know whatever it is why be greedy all these things that just naturally come those naturally come I got a fight to not be that maybe that's my unique thing maybe that's me personally being that way and I I just accept that and I just know that that's not who I am because humanity's you know it's it's come to a place of being really you know it's it's broken I mean just just look around I mean the pain that's so much pain and yeah I was going with that but um you know I I am hey baby thank you so much appreciate you so I mean the pain in this world it's just so it's like it's obvious and people are looking for hope and they're looking for a way out and they're looking for an escape and they're looking for they're looking for truth and they're looking for yeah and I'm just I've gotten the opportunity with my journey to just see a God whose accepts me loves me they call him the savior and I believe that to be true mmm Jesus saved me Justin at the start of this new decades and this might be a little hard to kind of put into context by on broadly speaking terms of just core values and core goals we would you ideally like to be at the end of this decade what would you like to what path would you like to have put your life on a fell like the last decades so much of it felt out of control mm-hm and I feel like you've worked hard to get some of that control back yeah I just feel like there's so much to look forward to I'm really excited excited to get mom likes emotional thinking about it I'm just excited to get it so you have babies with you I'm excited to just enjoy just celebrate you know all the amazing things that we've been given because we are blessed babe you know we talk about it all the time we just have a thing where we just say we're below we're so blessed we are man there's so much pain in the world and you don't understand why and there's so much things that are so unexplainable but what is the reality we are blessed you know I mean it's hard that dichotomy of like how can we mourn the loss of someone you know and accept that we are still blessed I think that's a really hard thing to discover but I think when you get there it's a beautiful place to be a beautiful place to be thanks man thank you hey apple what hold up please go up when i pull up they all on me like at once hey what's up guys it's great to see you all again and if you're new here i'm patrick and this is why i ramble about tech and other stuff so if you've been to this channel before you know i love my ipad pro it's been my favorite apple device and it's the device i had the highest hopes for this year yeah had because after watching yesterday's wwdc that is now out the window let's ramble so as some of you know i recently got the 16 gigabytes m1 ipad pro and i bought it grudgingly i don't need one terabyte of internal storage on an ipad does anyone but i had to get it because it was the only way to get access to that 16 gigabyte option lower storage options even the 512 gigs version maxed out at 8 gigs of ram so i went for the lowest possible storage option that offers 16 gigs of ram which is the one terabyte model but when you configure it like that the price is no joke i like my ipad to be autonomous so i went for the cellular version and so the price of this setup is a whopping two thousand dollars that's a lot of money for a tablet but i'm a tech channel and i had some seriously high hopes for this ipad when looking at the new hardware the higher ram the m1 chip the hdr screen and the new thunderbolt port and knowing that a full upgrade of ipad os was just around the corner not some incremental 14 point whatever update a full version update i thought whatever apple's cooking pun intended must be game changing now in my previous videos i already told you guys what those things were that i was hoping to get which things would make this ipad the beast of a machine i was hoping it to be the thing i was probably most excited about was this new thunderbolt port as it literally opens up the ipad to a ton of new possibilities the one thing that has always been missing from the ipad pro is full external monitor support sure technically you can hook it up to an external display now but when you do it's black bars bonanza and it looks awful so my first thought when they put a thunderbolt port in the ipad pro was awesome finally we're getting full-blown external monitor support including adaptive aspect ratios well that didn't happen so let's see what else didn't happen shall we pro apps i dedicated entire videos about how this ipad pro is now more than ready to run pro apps the most requested ones being final cut pro xcode and logic well that didn't happen either i mean after seeing apple giving lumafusion which is currently the best video editing app on the ipad a big stage at their april event i already kind of knew we weren't going to get final cut pro as such for the ipad in june but somehow i imagined tim cook walking on stage hand-in-hand with the blonde lumafusion lady and making a huge announcement about their mind-boggling new collaboration that didn't happen either logic and xcode nowhere to be seen the other huge gripe i have with the current ipad os is the files app it's just awful it feels archaic which is ironic for a company that believes everything should be intuitive and my biggest pet peeve of all there is no progress bar when you transfer files which means you're just gonna have to sit there and guess how long it's gonna take editing videos involve some pretty hefty files so that is not a fun time i thought surely they will fix that right nope apparently uncle tim thinks the files app is just fine oh but at least we got real multitasking now right no we didn't you get new ways of snapping your apps into a split screen but there is still no real window support so what did we end up getting this m1 16 gigabytes ipad pro running on ipad os is like putting a lawnmower engine inside a porsche or giving you the keys to a ferrari and then saying here's the keys this beast of a car but you can only drive it in school zones have fun that's not fun that's the opposite of fun i'm just gonna come out and say it i feel cheated by tim crook and his cronies who are probably laughing their heads off somewhere wiping their tears of laughter with our hard-earned cash anyway let's not be all negative they did do a few cool things right they turned apple notes into google docs so you can now collaborate and at mention friends and colleagues and that's great as long as all of your friends and colleagues are also on apple devices but wait you can now move your cursor from your ipad through your macbook to your imac because that's how we all work with all these three devices lined up next to each other oh stop with the sarcasm dude have you seen the home screen you can output your widgets wherever you want yeah i know a place where i want to stick those widgets so guys i have two questions for you did you get the m1 ipad pro and two will you be returning it guys sorry for the rant i just had to get this off my chest if you feel the same right now give the video one of these and let me know in the comments what you're most disappointed about not seeing in ipad os 15. subscribe for more content and see you in the next one do [Music] do [Music] huh [Music] huh mother Goose

California's bay area. Here is the stage for a truly remarkable natural occurrence. Every year, a great migration is made by one of the world's most mysterious species. To reach this utopian destination, these unique mammals will instinctively embark on a nomadic journey from all corners of the world. This is the developer's [inaudible], or as it is more commonly known, the developer. [ Music ] Eleven and a half months of hibernation has taken its toll, and the sun is harsh as these nocturnal cave-dwelling creatures must greet daylight. For most, this momentous migration is their first; while for a select few the pilgrimage is a time-honored tradition. Originating in the remote garages of Silicon Valley, developers evolved at an unprecedented speed. To understand how, we must observe them here, in their sacred temple. And so, it begins. As developers congregate at the event, access to the herd can be hard to come by. For some, blending in is easier said than done. To distinguish themselves, developers identify each other through decorative tribal symbols. These extraordinary coolidges [phonetic] are designed to entice and attract. [ Music ] Here, a pack of rogue younglings at play. The safety of numbers allows them to-- oh, wait a moment. They have now entrapped an indigenous silver-crested king developer. Although tempting, one may look at but not touch the mane. The feeding frenzy at the great gathering. Moving in like a pack of famished piranhas, this frugal breed will spare no morsel. Those who can, pull rank on the prime cuts. The event culminates in what is known as the keynote. As the doors open, a behavior [inaudible] can be found. Developers running at full speed, battling to secure a coveted front-row seat. Following the ceremony, the latest beta software is unleashed, it's nature at its cruelest. Only the strongest apps will survive. The many languages of the developer are a mystery to modern science. Just look at these letters, symbols, formulas, and mumbled jargon. Only these enlightened shamans can decode their true meaning. The creative bonds formed during the great migration will enable these geniuses to unlock our future world. The developer is no doubt a species scientists will continue to study for [inaudible]. [ Music ] [ Applause and Cheering ] >> Good morning! Good morning. [ Applause and Cheering ] I hear the student developers. Good morning and welcome to WWDC 2018. It is great to be back in San Jose with everyone. We have developers here from all over the world this morning, from 77 countries. That's more than ever before. [ Applause ] And I couldn't be happier to announce that we now have over 20 million Apple developers around the world. [applause] That's more than ever before. We've got 6000 folks in the hall this morning. Welcome. And many millions more watching online. Now the way the developers get to share their amazing work is through the App Store. Your creativity and hard work have made the App Store the best place to get the very best apps. Next month, the App Store turns ten. [ Applause ] And in these ten years, the App Store has fundamentally changed the way we all live. It's enabled countless new companies, created tens of millions of jobs, spawned entirely new industries, and it has forever changed our lives. The App Store is the world's largest app marketplace [applause], and we now welcome over 500 million weekly visitors. This is mind-blowing. It's the most incredible app marketplace that the world has ever seen. We're also happy to announce that this week we're going to achieve another huge milestone. The money that developers have earned through the App Store will top $100 billion. [ Applause ] This is just, this is beyond remarkable. The App Store is clearly the best place for you to be rewarded for your hard work and creativity. Now at Apple, we know that developers are a powerful group of creators, that they can achieve and they can develop anything that they can imagine with their code. We want more people to learn the power of code, and it all starts with Swift and Swift Playgrounds. We created Swift to make it easy, to make it so easy to learn to code that it was as easy as our products are to use. Swift is extremely popular. In fact, it's the fastest growing programming language out there. Now Apple developers are already using it in huge numbers. In fact, over 350,000 apps have been written in Swift on the App Store. Now [applause] we believe that coding is an essential skill and believe it should be offered by every school in the world. Learning to code has so many benefits. It develops problem solving and critical thinking skills. That's why created Everyone Can Code with free teaching and learning resources so that everyone could learn to code. It's been so successful and is now available to tens of millions of students around the world. Just imagine what this new generation of coders will create. Whatever it is, I'm sure that it's going to change the world. At Apple, changing the world and making it a better place is what it's all about for us. We aim to put the customer at the center of everything that we do. That's why, together with you, the developer community, we're working hard to provide new and better experiences for our customers to help them live a better day. And these experiences of course are expressed through our four amazing platforms. Today is all about software, and we've got some very exciting updates across all four platforms. We're going to get started with iOS. IOS embodies our philosophy of putting the customer at the center of everything that we design. Every year, we deliver a major iOS update that brings awesome new features that will impact the world. To tell you all about what we had planned for this year, I'd like to introduce Craig Frederique [phonetic]. Craig. [ Applause ] >> Hey, good morning. [ Applause ] All right. The next release of iOS is, you guessed it, iOS 12. Now, our customers, of course, are going to receive iOS 12 as a free software update. Now, it's easy to forget now, but iOS pioneered this approach of helping you get more out of the device you already own through free updates. And some of those updates have been really quite profound. Like the App Store, giving us a whole new way to discover and download apps. It itself was delivered via software update, as were the folders we used to organize those apps. And can you imagine living without Find My iPhone or iMessage with its end-to-end securely encrypted messaging. Or the revolution in iPad productivity with Slide Over, Split View, and Drag and Drop, or AR, changing the way we interact with the world around us, all delivered via software updates. And of course we want to get these improvements to as many of our customers as possible. IOS 11 supports devices that were introduced as far back as 2013, like the iPhone 5S. And we just love the way customers race to update to our newest releases. In fact, half of our customers upgraded to iOS 11 in just seven weeks. It's incredible. [ Applause ] Now as we stand here today, 81 percent of our over a billion active iOS devices are running our latest release. And now, when you look at the competition, well it's hard to say they really have a software update model. [ Applause ] So iOS has the fastest adoption of any operating system, but what's much more important to us is customer satisfaction, and we're thrilled to report that customer sat for iOS 11 is at 95 percent. [ Applause ] Now, delivering all of these features across such a wide range of devices will maintaining high performance is a challenge we take really seriously, and so for iOS 12, we are doubling down on performance. We're working top to bottom making improvements, to make your device faster and more responsive, and because we want these changes to be available to the full range of our customers, iOS 12 will be available on all the same devices as iOS 11. [ Applause ] This is the largest base ever supported by an Apple release, and we're focusing our efforts especially on the oldest devices. And while it's still early days, we're really pleased with some of the results we're seeing. And so I'd like to share some with you. And I'm going to use an example of a popular phone from a few years ago. This is the iPhone 6Plus. Now on that device, iOS 12 delivers a number of improvements across common operations. You'll see that apps launch up to 40 percent faster. The keyboard can come up up to 50 percent faster, and you can slide to take a photo at up to 70 percent faster. [ Applause ] Now our deepest focus this year is optimizing the system when it's under load, and that's where you need performance the most and where iOS 12 really shines. Now, we've put iOS 12 through our stress test, and we saw in those conditions Share Sheet coming up twice as fast and apps launching twice as fast. These are big, big improvements. Now this took changes-- thank you very much. This took improvements in many, many places in the system, and I want to highlight just one. And it starts with the silicon. You know, our tight collaboration with our chip team has enabled us to optimize iOS across the full range of our A series silicon. Now CPUs traditionally respond to increased demand for performance by slowly ramping up their clock speed. Well now on IOS 12, we're much smarter. When we detect that you need a burst of performance, like when you begin scrolling or launching an app, we ramp up processor performance instantly to its highest states, delivering high performance and to ramp it down just as fast to preserve battery life. Now, these are just some of the improvements that are coming to not just our older devices, but the full range of devices, and that's a quick update on performance. [ Applause ] Now if this is all we'd done in iOS 12, I think it would be a great release, but we've done more. Much more. And we have a lot to cover today, and it starts with augmented reality. Yeah. [applause and cheering] Now AR is transformational technology. By bringing experiences into the real world, it enables all kinds of new experiences, changing the way we have fun and the way we work, and in iOS 12, we wanted to make an easy way to experience AR across the system, and to do that, we got together with some of the greatest minds in 3D at Pixar, and together we created a new file format for AR. It's called USDZ, and it's a compact, single-file format that's optimized for sharing while retaining great 3D graphics and even animations. Now, you can use USDZ across the system from the files app, to Safari, even sharing them over messages and mail, and what's great is you can place these 3D objects into the real world. It's something that's like AR quick look. It's really awesome. Now, we want all kinds of creatives to be able to create content for AR, and so we're working with the leading companies for 3D tools and 3D libraries to bring their support for USDZ. Now one company that's been all in on USDZ and ARKit is Adobe, and to tell you about what they're up to, I'd like to invite Abhay Parasnis, their CTO, to the stage. Abhay. [ Applause ] >> Thanks Craig. It's great to be here this morn. So at Adobe we believe augmented reality is an incredibly important technology. And with ARKit, Apple is by far the most powerful platform for AR. So earlier Craig talked about USDZ format. It's actually a pretty big deal. There is now a way to deliver AR experiences across the entire iOS experience. And so today we are actually announcing that we are going to bring native USDZ support to Adobe's Creative Cloud. [ Applause ] With Creative Cloud, designers and developers will now be able to use familiar apps, apps that they know and love, like Photoshop or Dimension, to create amazing AR content and bring it easily via USDZ. And of course, we are not going to stop there. We are going to bring the power of immersive design to Creative Cloud with a new set of services and applications including a brand-new iOS application that's going to let all of you design amazing AR experiences quickly. So, you will be able to bring in images, videos, text, any object from Creative Cloud directly into a native AR environment. In fact, for the first time with Creative Cloud and iOS, you will have a what you see is what you get editing in AR. It's pretty cool. So, come join this afternoon State of the Union where we're able to give you a sneak peak of some of these new immersive design tools for the first time. Thanks. Back to you Craig. [applause] >> Thank you, Abhay. [applause] Now a critical part of enabling AR is accurate measurement, and fortunately the precise calibration of sensors in iOS devices and our tight hardware software integration mean that we do this really well, and we want to enable everyone to take advantage of this capability. So we're introducing a new app, and it's called Measure. It makes it really easy to measure objects, detect rectangles and get their dimensions, and measure lines along surfaces, and I'd like to show it to you now. [applause] Now, in looking for something to measure, I ended up digging through the attic and came upon my old suitcase from my traveling days in college. A lot of memories in here. Now I'm actually in the Measure app, and you see I can easily measure along this suitcase by just tapping and dragging out a line, like that, and check that out. It's a measurement. [applause] Now, what's really cool is I can extend these measurements so I can just tap, drag along another edge just like that, and even take it into full 3D by dragging down to the bottom like that. Isn't that cool? [ Applause ] Now I mentioned that we could automatically detect rectangles and show you dimensions of objects. So I have a photo here actually. It's one my mom always wanted me to travel with of me as a baby, and so, you see, what I can do with Measure is it automatically detects the dimensions of that photo. I can just tap and get, oh, yeah, a cute little baby, wasn't I? And you can get measurements just like that. It's really fantastic. [ Applause ] Now, I'd like to turn now to USDZ and its support throughout the system. You know, you can experience USDZ in so many places, and one of those places is news. Now here's an article. We're all accustomed to seeing images in news articles. But check this out. Here you see a USDZ asset. It can just tap on this little 3D control and jump right in and experience it. You can see the amazing animations that are possible, and of course it's fully interactive. So I can zoom in and pan. Isn't that amazing? [applause] Now USDZ is also great in the web. So here I am at the Fender website and actually let you configure your guitar with the kind of finish and pickguard that you want. So I can select a configuration option here, and then I can see the guitar I've configured. So I'm just going to tap in. Of course I can see the guitar here, but wouldn't it be cool if I could see it in the real world in its real size? Well, there it is. Check that out. [applause] I think I'm going to capture that for posterity. And that's a quick look at USDZ and Measure in iOS 12. Next-- thank you. [applause] Next, I'd like to talk about the key technology behind these augmented reality experiences, and that's ARKit. ARKit opens up the world of AR to hundreds of millions of users, making it the world's largest AR platform by far. And we're on a relentless pace of advancement with AR, and that continues today with ARKit 2. Yes. ARKit 2 delivers advances with improved face tracking, more realistic rendering, and support for 3D object detection and persistence, which enables launching into AR experiences associated with a particular object or a physical space, like starting a game built around a physical toy or having a physical classroom serve as the foundation for a lesson that was authored in AR. But probably best is the support for shared experiences. Now this delivers true, multiuser augmented reality. You and the people around you will be able to see your own perspective on a common virtual environment. And to help all you developers get started, we created this sample app written in Swift that you'll all be getting today. Now, check out how both players and even a third observer can all experience the same environment in real time. It's really fun. [ Applause ] Now, we've also brought in a select few developers into our labs over the last couple of weeks to work with ARKit, and they love it. Now, one of them is Lego. And what they've done is so fun, you just need to see it. So I'm pleased to invite Martin Sanders, director of innovation of Lego, to the stage to give you a live demonstration. Martin. >> Craig, thank you very much. [ Applause ] Creating and playing with physical Lego sets brings great joy to millions of children and Lego fans all over the world. And now, with ARKit 2, we get to expand those creative possibilities like never before and take things beyond the physical. What we try to do is combine physical and digital together to really open up those creative play possibilities, because our Lego sets are really the start point for all of those children's imaginations. And when we get a chance to really imbed ARKit 2, it takes it to the next level. Let me show you what I mean. Here we have Assembly Square. It's one of our Lego creator sets and already has so many great details it's awesome to play with. But wouldn't it be great if we could take things even further? Well now with 3D object detection, we get to recognize our models and bring them to life. [ Music ] And just look at all of those rich details we can now bring into our sets, because when we combine physical and digital together like this, it really opens up those creative play possibilities. And there's so much to do here. Did you see these icons of the people and objects? Well they represent missions and stories that we can explore. And with a world as rich and as immersive as this, who wouldn't want to play? So let's add a character. How about this little guy here? >> Welcome back, let's go on an adventure. >> Awesome. Let's go on an adventure. But going on an adventure with friends is often way more fun. Anders, why don't you pop in here. >> I'm always up for an adventure. >> Perfect. Because now with ARKit 2's multiuser support, we get to play with up to four friends in the same space. Let's go ahead and add a few things from our collection, Anders. >> Okay. I will add a bank over here. >> Very nice, I like it. How about taking this for a spin. Let's just look at all those rich details you can see on the outside of the building and even on the inside. Yeah, I think I'm going to add this guy. He's definitely going to keep the bank safe. Oh look, my character's hungry. Let's take him over to the bakery. Well let's see what they have. Because now with ARKit 2, we get to see inside our physical creations and check out all the details that were hidden before. We've got a ballerina, a little music session going on, and let's make a bathroom-- oops sorry. Moving on. Oh, another play trigger in the bakery. Let's see what happens when I click on this. >> Um, fresh [inaudible]. >> Oh, that doesn't look too good. >> Anders, I've got a situation. I'm going to need your help over here. >> Yeah, okay, okay. I've got a firetruck. >> Perfect. You put out those flames while-- oh, oh dear. Somebody's got themselves trapped on the roof, so I'm going to use this helicopter to go and pick up these clowns. [music] How are you getting on down there Anders? >> I'm almost done, almost done. >> Great. Those guys are safe. And the flames look like they're almost out. Perfect, we did it. Yeah. What? [ Applause ] And we've even unlocked a new item for our collection. But the fun doesn't need to end there because with ARKit 2, we get to save our entire world back into our physical set and pick up where we left off. [applause] All right. That's awesome. So much fun. But what makes this truly amazing is how with just a single Lego creation and ARKit 2 it really opens up those creative play possibilities. So look out for more Lego AR experiences in the App Store later this year. Thank you very much everybody. [ Applause ] >> Isn't that great? So that's our update on AR and iOS 12. Next, I'd like to turn to Photos. You know, over a trillion photos are captured on iPhone each year, and Photos is the best way to relive and share those moments. This year we're making photos even better, and it starts with Search. Search has powerful object and scene recognition. It lets you search for photos based on things like searching for cars or dogs or flowers, and that's a great way to explore your library, but in iOS 12, Search now starts working for you even before you start typing with Search suggestions. It'll highlight things for you like key moments and people that are important to you, places where you've taken some great photos and even categories of photos like hiking and water sports. And Search is much more powerful than ever. You can search for places by business name. So you could search for SFMOMA or even a broad category like museum. And, Photos indexes over four million events by time and place. Things like sporting events and concerts, and so you can search for them and find photos you took at those events. And search is super powerful. You can now search for multiple search terms like surfing and vacation and even get suggestions for additional search terms to help you find exactly what you're looking for. And now in iOS 12 we have an all new tab. It's called For You. And with For You, you have all of your memories, so those great memory movies, but more like featured photos highlighting a photo that you took on this day in past years. And Effects Suggestions, for instance, suggesting looping a live photo or applying a new portrait effect to one of your portrait photos. And we even highlight your shared album activity. Now when it comes to sharing, there are many ways you can share photos, but our focus is on sharing great photos with the people you care about most, and that's why this year in For You we've added Sharing Suggestions. So imagine you've gone out for a great dinner with some friends and you took some photos. Well afterwards in For You, you'll see a suggestion like this to share those photos. If you tap in, you'll see that photos is even recommending a set of photos from that set that you might want to share and suggest who you might want to share them with based in part by the people that appeared in the photos. And when you share them, they're shared at full resolution out of your iCloud photo library and when you're friend receives them, something really magical happens. Their phone searches their libraries for other photos they took at that event and suggest that they share them back to you, so you both can end up with a full set. [ Applause ] Now this is built around iMessage so of course it's private, using end-to-end encryption, and all of those smarts are done with on-device machine learning. So that's your quick update on Photos in iOS 12, and next, let's turn to Siri. Now Siri is by far the world's most used digital assistant with over 10 billion requests processed per month, and because Siri works across all your devices, it's always there to help you through your day getting things done. Now we all know that Siri works with many third-party apps for things like messaging, ride sharing, and payments. But we wanted to make Siri able to do much more for you, and we're doing that by taking advantage of the power of apps with a new feature we call Shortcuts. Now with shortcuts any app can expose quick actions to Siri. Let's look at some examples. Now say you have the Tile app because you're always losing your keys. Well, the Tile app can expose the option to add a shortcut to Siri. And you can assign your own phrase, such as I lost my keys would be a good choice, and when you then say it, Siri will automatically activate Tile and show you right in the Siri UI start ringing your Tile just like that. It's really great. [applause] [ Applause ] Of course there's so many uses for this kind of thing. You could say game time to get your team's schedule from TeamSnap or help me relax to kick off a meditation or order my groceries to order your usual. You know, with millions of apps, Shortcut enables incredible possibilities for how you use Siri. Now, as you know, Siri is more than just a voice. Siri is working all the time in the background to make proactive suggestions for you even before you ask, and now with Shortcut, Siri can do so much more. So, for instance, let's say you order a coffee every morning at Phil's before you go to work. Well now, Siri can suggest right on your lock screen that you do that. You tap on it, and you can place the order right from there. Or if when you get to the gym you use Active to track workouts, well that suggestion will appear right on your lock screen. And this even works when you pull down into Search. You'll get great suggestions. Like say you're running late for a meeting, well Siri will suggest you text the meeting organizer. Or when you go to the movie, suggest that you turn on Do Not Disturb. That's just being considerate. And remind you to call grandma on her birthday. Just tap, and it'll dial the call for you. Now, we think we're all going to really enjoy using Shortcuts, and so we went a step further. We wanted to let you create your own shortcuts as users, multiple steps across multiple applications, and we're doing it with a new Shortcuts app. So with the Shortcuts app, you could do something like create a shortcut for surf time, and it could go get you the surf report, look up the current weather, get you the ETA to the beach, and even create a reminder for you to put on sunscreen when you get there. Now, it's all done with simple drag and drop steps in the Shortcuts editor right here. It's really easy. Now to show you how Shortcuts can streamline your day, I'd like to invite one of our leaders from our Siri Shortcuts project, Kim Beverette [phonetic], to the stage to give you a live demo. Kim. >> Hey! [ Applause ] I'm am so stoked to show you Siri Shortcuts. To do that, I'm going to walk you through my day. So imagine it's the morning. I'm headed to work, and I pick up my phone, and I see this suggestion from Phil's Coffee. Siri has learned that I do this most mornings, so now I can just tap on the suggestion and I see all the details I need to confirm my perfect Mint Monkey Dough right here on the lock screen without even going into the app. So let's get caffeinated. And I'm done. Fast forward a little bit, and I'm sitting at my desk at my office and I need to know when my next meeting is. I'll go to the Up Next widget, and it looks like I am running a little late for a rather important meeting, so I should probably let someone know. And it looks like Shortcuts is a few steps ahead of me. I could call into the meeting, or I could let the organizer know that I am running late. I should probably tell Arie what's up. That looks like just what I want to say, sorry Arie, let's send it. Perfect. I also want to show you how you can add a shortcut to Siri. So let's take a look at Kayak. I keep all of my travel details in Kayak. Most important is my post WWDC relaxation trip to Los Angeles. You can see I have got my flight, my hotel, all the details, everything I need, but what I really want is to be able to use this and get to this information with my voice while I'm on the go. So, let's head back, and I can just tap add to Siri, record my custom phrase, travel plans [beep], and I'm done. So now when I land at the airport and I'm about to get in a cab and I could really use that hotel address, I can just say, travel plans. >> Kayak says your hotel is at 929 South Broadway. You can check in after 3 p.m. >> Isn't that cool? [applause] It's pretty cool. [ Applause ] So I would love to be on that vacation, but I should, I don't know, probably finish this demo, so let's head back to work, and I can show you how the Shortcut app can help me with my commute home. We start in the Gallery where there's hundreds of premade shortcuts that you can download, or we can hop over to the library, and I've got a bunch of shortcuts here, but I want to show you my heading home shortcut. You can see that it's just really a series of steps. It grabs my location and travel time, and it sends my ETA to my roommate. It sets my HomeKit thermostat to 70 degrees, and it turns on my fan. And last, it gets directions home with Apple maps with the best route to avoid traffic. Now this is already pretty cool, but I happen to be an NPR News junkie, so I should probably just add that to my shortcut to save me some trouble on the ride home. Let's tap search, and there's a bunch I can add here, but I can just tap Siri suggestions, and there it is, play KQED Radio, we'll drag this in, drop it, and we're set. I've already added the shortcut to Siri with a custom phrase, heading home, so now, whenever I leave work, I can just say, heading home. >> You will get there in one hour. I sent a message to Cheryl. Your thermostat is set to 70 degrees, and I turned on the fan. Playing KQED Radio. [music] >> Right? [ Applause ] That's Siri Shortcuts in iOS 12. Thank you so much. >> Thank you, Kim. [ Applause ] >> And that's Siri Shortcuts. It works on iPhone and iPad, and of course you can run your shortcuts from your home pod and your Apple Watch. And that's your quick update on Siri. Next, let's talk about apps, and to tell you about the latest, I'm going to hand it off to Susan. Susan. [ Applause and Cheering ] >> Hello. Thanks Craig and it is so great to be here. I'm excited to tell you about some great updates in some of our most popular apps, starting with one of my favorites, News. So News is a personalized feed where you can see all the stories you want to read pulled together from trusted sources. And, our top stories are handpicked by the Apple News editorial team to make a great collection of curated content. With our new browse tab, you can discover new channels and topics, and we've made it even easier to jump to your favorites because that's why they're your favorites, right? News shines on the iPad. We've added a new sidebar, and it's a great way to navigate. It makes it easy and I fun to dig into the areas you're most interested in. So that's news. Now, we've completely rebuilt the Stocks app, and it's got a beautiful new design. Of course, you can still see the stock prices and the changes at a glance, but we've added spark lines, those little charts, that show the stock performance throughout the day. And that's cool, but are you ready? We are so excited to announce we're bringing Apple News to Stocks. [ Applause ] I'm really excited about that, and the top stories in Stocks features business news, right, curated by the Apple News editors. It's pretty terrific. You can tap on any stock to get a more detailed view, so you can see an interactive chart that now includes after hours pricing, and you see relevant headlines from Apple News curated by our Apple News editor. So it looks great. And if you tap on one of those headlines, you'll see the full article without leaving the app, and of course it's formatted to look gorgeous on the iPhone. Now, with iOS 12, we're bringing Stocks to iPad. [ Applause ] It's pretty great, and we take advantage of the larger display, so you can keep your eye on your stocks on the left while you browse through your financial news. It's a pretty great experience. Next up, Voice Memos. We've also completely rebuilt Voice Memos to make it even easier to use, and we're bringing Voice Memos to the iPad for the first time. [ Applause ] Importantly, we've also added iCloud support so your recordings stay in sync across all your devices. We think iPad users are just going to love this. And we think that iBooks is the best way to discover and experience eBooks as well as audio books, and with iOS 12, we're introducing an all new design, and we think the update is so great, we're calling it Apple Books, a new name. Very dramatic. We dropped the i. [applause] Apple Books has some great new features. For example, Reading Now, with a preview that makes it really easy for you to pick reading right where you left off. And there's so much more, including a stunning new store that makes browsing through your eBooks and audio books better than ever. We love these updates, and we think you will too, but we also have a smart and safe way to use your apps in the car. I think you know I'm talking about Car Play. Car Play already supports third-party audio and voice messaging, you know, voice calling and messaging apps, you problem know that. But what you might not know is with IOS 12, Car Play will also support third-party navigation apps. [ Applause ] So now you have even more choices when you use Car Play. That is a really quick look at some of our app dates, and Craig, back to you. [applause] >> Thank you, Susan. [applause] Well, now I'd like to take a moment to talk about something that's on a lot of people's minds lately. You know, iPhone and iPad are some of the most powerful tools ever created for learning, exploring, and keeping in touch, but some apps demand more of our attention than we might even realize. They beg us to use our phone when we really should be occupying ourselves with something else. They send us flurries of notifications, trying to draw us in for fear of missing out. And some of us, it's become such a habit that, you know, we might not even recognize just how distracted we've become. Well, we've thought deeply about this, and today we're announcing a comprehensive set of built-in features to help you limit distraction, focus, and understand how you're spending your time and balance the many things that are important to you. Now it starts with Do Not Disturb. There are times of the day, or times when you just don't want to be disturbed, and one of those, of course, is at night. Sometimes you wake up in the middle of the night, and you look at your phone, maybe just to check the time, and you're confronted with something like this, a barrage of notifications that spin you up and keep you from falling back asleep. And so we're introducing Do Not Disturb during bedtime where all you'll see is this. Nothing to get you spun up. And in the morning, yeah. [ Applause ] In the morning when you wake up, you're gently eased into your day. You can tap when you want to start confronting those notifications. Now we've all found ourselves in situations like this. [laughter] Now, rest assured, he stuck the landing on this one. But now Do Not Disturb can help, and we made it easier than ever to use Do Not Disturb because now we have a great new mode where when you press in to Do Not Disturb and Control Center, you can set an ending time for Do Not Disturb for when you leave a particular location or when an event ends on your calendar. So I think we're all going to be using Do Not Disturb a bunch more. Now next I want to talk about Notifications. Now, Notifications help keep us informed and connected to important things that happen throughout the day, and we'd like to give you more control over how many notifications you receive, and so we're enabling what we call Instant Tuning for Notifications right from the lock screen. You can press in to a notification, and from there, you can decide to send future notifications from that app directly to Notifications Center, bypassing your lock screen. Or turn them off altogether, and Siri will even help by suggesting that you turn off Notifications for apps that you're no longer using. Now, we also wanted to give you help managing large numbers of notifications. So I'm thrilled to announce that we're bringing to iOS support for grouped notifications. [ Applause ] Notifications are grouped not just by app but also by topic and thread. It gives you a great overview of the notifications you've received. You can tap in and look at a particular group. But of course just as important with a single swipe, you can triage a whole group of notifications away. So that's Notifications. [ Applause ] Now, in addition to these great features for helping you limit distractions, we wanted to go further, and it's with a feature we call screen time. Screen time empowers you with both insight and control over how you spend your time, and it starts with reports. Every week, you get a weekly activity summary that details how you used your iPhone or iPad. You tap in, and you get to view your full activity report. It's really detailed. You get deep insight on how much time you're spending, where you're spending it, and even how your use breaks down during the day or the night. You get a summary of the time you're spending in apps, how much time you're spending, how often per hour you're picking up your phone and what's drawing you in and what apps are sending you the most notifications. Now, equipped with this insight, you can make decisions about how much time you want to spend with your device each day. But we know there are people who would like a little extra help in managing their use of apps, and for them we've created App Limits. So if in your activity report you see an app where you might want to be spending a little bit less time, well you can set your own limit, and then during the day, when you're using the app, you receive a helpful notification letting you know time is almost up. [ Applause ] And once you've reached your limit, instead of the app, you'll see this. It's time to move on. Now, we'll let you grant yourself and extension if you want, but we'll give you a reminder later to move along. Now, this is also in sync across your iPhone and iPad, so your limits apply to your total usage. And we think this is going to be helpful for many people, but especially for some kids. And we know this is something that can help families achieve the right balance for them. And of course it starts with providing your kids with great information so they get an activity report of their own, but as a parent, you get one as well on your device, and based on what you see, you have the option of creating allowances. [ Applause ] Now you have many options. One of them is downtime, time when you want your kids to unplug altogether. For instance, at bedtime. And you can also limit your kids' time in apps by category or by individual app. Now, there's some apps you may want to always allow them to use. For instance, you may want them to be able to get at the phone at all times, so they can contact you. Or you may want to give them access to educational apps. And you can also limit access to only movies, apps, and websites that you deem age appropriate. Now, this works of course across their iPhone and iPad, and it's uses family sharing, so it's super easy to set up, and you can manage it all remotely from your parent parental device. And so that's are some-- Screen Time has great features to help you better manage your time. [ Applause ] Now, next I'd like to talk about one of the most important uses of our devices, and that's communication. And we'll start with messages. Messages has given us fun ways to express ourselves with emoji and now Animoji, and one of the things that make Animoji so fun is how expressive they are, you know, from smiles to frowns, to nods of the head and blinking of the eye. Animoji does such an amazing job tracking our expressions. And this year, we're taking Animoji to a whole new level, the breakthrough new technology we call Tongue Detection. [applause] That's right. Now, you can make your favorite Animoji do this. We're all going to be sticking out our tongues to our phones in the near future. Now, we've also, we're also introducing some great new Animoji that I think you're all going to love, like ghost, koala, tiger, and T-Rex. But we wanted to take Animoji even further by making them even more personal. So I'm thrilled today to announce the arrival of the era of Memoji. [applause] That's right. With Memoji you can create your very own personalized Animoji. [ Applause ] Now, these Animoji can look like you or the real you. And we've worked hard to build a deep set of customization options to let our customers create an incredibly diverse set of Memoji. It's really incredible what you can create. And we've designed a beautiful new experience to create these Memoji that makes the process fun and easy. Now, to tell you more about it, I'd like to invite one of the managers of our Messages and Animoji features, Kelsey Peterson, to give you a live demo. Kelsey. [ Applause and Cheering ] Good morning. I cannot wait to tell you what's new with Messages. Let's get started with Animoji. First, you need to meet the newest members of the team. We've got a new cat in town, our tiger. She's so cute. And now, my personal favorite, the koala. Just getting excited scrolling through here. They can't all be cute and cuddly though, so here's our T-Rex. And we've our very own friendly little ghost. So much fun. And if I swipe right, here's where I can create my very own Memoji. Let me show you just how easy it is. I recently chopped my hair, so I want one that matches the new me. So I've selected a skin color, and now I'm trying to figure out just the right amount of freckles. It's a real Goldilocks scenario. Yeah, these are just right. Okay. Onto the main event. There are so many hairstyles to choose from. First, I'm going to grab my color, and then like I said, I need to go a little bit shorter. All right. Nope, this is the one. Now that I'm all set, I can of course select my eye color, and what's really amazing is as I'm making changes, the character up above is coming to life. There are tons of options for me to customize. I could add earrings, but what I really want is a great pair of Sunnies, so I'm going to come over to eyewear and pick out some frames. Maybe not for today. I think I need two lenses. These are the ones. Now that I have frames, I'm going to tint my lenses to make a great pair of sunglasses. [ Applause ] Perfect. Okay. I think I'm all set. I'll tap done, which saves my grandly created Memoji right here into the drawer alongside the rest of my team. And that's how simple it is to create your very own Memoji. [ Applause ] Now I have a brand-new feature to introduce you to. This wasn't even in Craig's slides. We are bringing fun effects into the Messages camera. Let's take a look. I've a message here from my partner. It looks like he's informing me that he's bought our dog, Ferdinand, yet another tiny dog hat. This isn't even the first. I think this is the perfect opportunity for a response with this new fun camera. So I'll tap to pull up the camera, and then I can see this little star over here on the left. Tapping on that gives me a strip with all sorts of new effects. So I could add things like shapes or text. But let's check out these filters. Ooh. So this is comic book. It's really fun, but for a response about a tiny dog hat, I think I'm going to go in a different artistic direction. So what I really need to do is add a sticker from one of my favorite sticker packs. Ferdy looked really excited about that new dog hat, so I'm going to put him right here, and now we have an all new way for you to use Animoji. I can apply my favorite Animoji right here live. [ Applause ] Here's the Memoji I just created, but I actually have just the one. It's of me in a very similar red hat, which is kind of perfect for twinning with my pup. So I'm going to set up my shot, snap, and send. And that's a demo of the fun new effects in messages. To you Craig. [ Applause ] >> So that's Memoji and some fun new effects in the camera and messages. Next, let's talk about Facetime. Yeah. Facetime is the way that so many of us connect with the people in our lives and share some of our most important moments, and it's helped us deepen our connect with people important to us wherever they are, and of course it's a fun place just to hang out. Now this year Facetime is going to take a big leap forward because today we're introducing Group Facetime. [ Applause ] Now, you'll be able to facetime with two people, three people, actually up to 32 simultaneous participants. [ Applause ] Now, setting up a group call couldn't be easier. Just instead of typing one person's name, you can do many. You can ring them by tapping audio or video, but we also introduced a great new way because Facetime is now integrated into messages, so you can quickly go from a group chat you have going directly into a group Facetime, and members of the group can join in and drop out at any time. It's really great. Would you like to see it? [applause] Well let's do a demo. [applause] Well I think for our first live demo of group Facetime, I'm going to contact the folks back in Cupertino. I can just dive in to this conversation I have going with the members of the Facetime team, and it looks like actually they're already on a group Facetime call, so I'm just going to join right in. Hey everybody. >> Hey Craig. >> Check it out. So it's this beautiful Facetime UI with these big gorgeous tiles right up front where you see some of the leaders of the Facetime team, and down at the bottom there's and area we call the roster that contains everybody else. And of course I'm right there in the lower right-hand corner. >> Hey Craig. Wait, am I on the big screen? >> Yes, Lauren, this is not a test. You're in front of 6000 of your biggest new fans. [ Applause ] Now, what you probably notice is when Lauren spoke, her tile automatically got larger to reflect her prominence in the conversation. This is totally automatic. Hey Roberto, how's it going back there in Cupertino? >> I'd say it's going pretty well, and Lauren, sorry for stealing your spotlight. >> So this works of course for people in the roster as well. When they speak, they come forward. Hey Christopher, you ready to make your big entrance? >> Finally, my moment has come. Hello world. >> Now, well done. Now you can control this too, so I want to bring Woody front and center, I just double tab. There he is. Woody, your baby is performing admirably here. >> Thanks Craig. It's exciting to finally be able to share Group Facetime with everyone. >> It sure is. Now, we have not only all of this, but we've also brought the fun effects to the Facetime camera. I can just tap in, and I have access to Animoji, filters, and all of my sticker packs, and everyone else on the call can apply them too. Now this is the future. >> Hey, Craig. Check this out, I'm a comic book koala, something I've always wanted to be. [laughter] >> I'm glad you've finally been able to express that side of yourself, Roberto. Hey, Tim, is that you? >> Yeah, it's me. I've signed up to help test Facetime. >> All right. [applause] Well, well thank you, Tim. Every little bit counts. >> Happy to help, and thanks to everyone on the Facetime team for making it a reality. I can't wait to start using it every Sunday night to follow the leadership team. >> Looking forward to that, Tim. Of course what I'm really looking forward to is getting Group Facetime to everyone on iOS 12. Thanks guys for a fantastic call. We'll see you back in Cupertino. [ Applause ] So that's Group Facetime. It works on iPhone, iPad, and Mac, and you can even answer an audio on your wrist on your Apple Watch. So that's Facetime and Messages, and this is iOS 12. Improved performance, new AR experiences, Siri Suggestions, Screen Time, Memoji and fun effects in the Messages camera, and Group Facetime. I hope you like it. I'm going to hand it back to Tim. Thank you. [ Applause ] >> Thank you, Craig. IOS 12 looks fantastic, and we can't wait for everyone to get their hands on it. Next up, we'd like to talk about the Apple Watch. Yeah. [applause] When we began development of the watch many years ago, we had a vision for just how impactful and essential it could become in our lives, so we worked very hard to create something that you would love and want to wear all the time, and customers do love it. In fact, Apple Watch is number one in customer satisfaction, [applause] and not just this year, but every single year since we launched in 2015. And growth has been off the charts. Apple Watch grew 60 percent last year. We're constantly hearing from customers about the many ways that the Apple Watch has changed their lives. And I'd like to share just one of them with you this morning. Mary Dovgen was boating with her husband, John, when due to a medical condition all of John's muscles went completely limp, and he fell into the ice cold water. With her arms wrapped around John to keep him from drowning, Mary could not reach her phone to call for help. But with her Apple Watch, she was able to call Siri, or to use Siri to call 911, rescuers soon arrived, and saved John's live. [ Applause ] As Mary told us, if it wasn't for my Apple Watch, he really would not be here today. This is just one of the many stories that we've heard about about how Apple Watch is impacting people's lives. They range from getting people to be more active, to helping users live a healthier life, or even to alerting users to an elevated heart rate. Apple Watch brings such amazing capabilities right to the wrist, and of course at the heart of this is watchOS. We're excited to introduce watchOS 5 today, which brings even more ways for you to stay active and connected, and I'd like to hand it off to Kevin Lynch to tell you all about it. Kevin. [ Applause ] >> Good morning. You know, stories like that, about how Apple Watch is supporting people around the world in even extreme situations like Mary and John's but also in their daily lives is really super motivating to us as a team. And there are things you do every day that shape your life. And Apple Watch has two [inaudible] working to help you support those activities every day. First, staying active to increase your well-being and health and second being connected to the people and the information that you care most about, and we're moving watchOS in both of these areas. Let's start with health and fitness. Now much of the power in the health and fitness features that we've put in Watch are really empowered by the investment we do to make sure the data you see is accurate. The data from our custom-built heart rate sensor, Accelerometer, Gyro, GPS, are all thoroughly validated. In fact, from our fitness lab, we've studied over six terabytes of data where 12,000 study participants logged over 90,000 hours of sessions. And they actually burned 2.3 million calories doing this. We believe this is the largest biometric data collection of its kind. And we take this information and we work to integrate this seamlessly with the user experience so when you raise your wrist and you look at your activity rings, the information is not only accurate, but it's also meaningful to you. We really love hearing about your focus on closing these rings. And we really enable this through a number of ways in Apple Watch. First, of course, we do daily coaching so you can see what your goals are for the day. We also support celebrations when you achieve your goals, and we have special edition challenges like the most recent birthday challenge that we did. And on a monthly basis, we do monthly goals that are personalized to you. And of course the activity app also supports activity sharing, which has become one of the most popular features of the activity app. Many of you love the excitement of good old-fashioned competition though, so in watchOS 5, you can challenge any of your activity-sharing friends to a seven-day competition whenever you would like. And if they accept, you each try to win the week by closing your rings and earning points. You earn one point for each percent of a ring that you close. And while you're in the middle of a competition, your progress notifications are updated, do not only show you the progress your friends are making, but also where you stand in the competition. And when you win, you receive a new award. We're really excited about this edition, and if you're competition, it gives you a whole new way to enjoy the activity app. Now when you're doing [applause]-- now when you do want to go do a workout, there's a lot of workout types you can choose from, and they all have custom algorithms to measure things like calorie burn, pace, distance, elevation gain, and when you're swimming, it even counts laps and detects which swim strokes you're using. And with Gym Kit, your metrics are in sync with your favorite gym equipment. And we're really excited to bring more enhancements to workouts in watchOS 5, starting with a new workout type for yoga. Now this works primarily from your heart rate, and we calibrate this to your fitness through the rest of your day, so now you can more accurately track those yoga sessions including those intense Vinyasa sessions. New we've also added a new workout type for hiking. This takes into account pace and heart rate and elevation gain so you can more accurately get exercise credit while you're hiking on steep terrain or really long stages. And Apple watch has become a really great running companion especially now that we've added GPS and cellular and music streaming. And we're making this an even better experience now for training runs and races. In addition to current and average pace, you now have the option to keep track of your rolling mile pace, which is how fast you ran the immediately preceding mile. You can also now set a custom pace alert, so your Apple watch will tap you when you're above or below the pace that you've set. And finally, runners will now get cadence so you can see your current steps per minute. We're really excited for runners to try these out. Now-- [ Applause ] Now there are sometimes when you forget to start a workout on watch, but you've started working out, and to solve this now, we're adding automatic workout detection. [ Applause ] So your Apple Watch will now offer to start tracking your workout if it senses that you're beginning one. And even if you press start sometime after you began working out, you'll get retroactive credit for the workouts that you did. [ Applause ] And [inaudible] wills support all these great workouts on Apple Watch. Now when you reduce the intensity of your movement or your heart rate decreases but you forget to end your workout, of course Watch will also detect that and suggest that you stop. [ Applause ] So, all these new features, activity competitions, the new yoga and hiking workout, new features for runners and automatic workout detection are all enabling you to more accurately track your workouts and stay motivated while you do. Now let's talk about being connected. Apple Watch enables you to remain in the moment while also easily connected to the people and information that you care about. And the introduction of cellular made this even better. You can stay connected even when you're going out for an evening, running some errands, or even going for a swim. Or, stay in touch when your phone might not be easily available to you. And staying connected with people you love is something that our customers love about Apple Watch. You can easily make or receive a phone call, and you can hear the emotion and tone at the other end of the voice as you talk in real time. Or you can use Messages to have impromptu, short conversations with loved ones in a Message threat. In watchOS 5, you'll have an entirely new way to communicate on your watch. That's real-time voice but with a spontaneity of short messaging. >> Did you steal my chips? >> Maybe. >> I cannot wait until you go to college. >> Introducing Walkie Talkie. [ Applause ] This is a new app by Apple Watch. It's fun, easy way to talk with friends and family. Let's take a look at how it works. First you choose who you'd like to enable Walkie Talkie with, and it suggests some people that you often communicate with, so you could easily add them. Now the first time that you do this, your friend will receive a one-time request to allow a walkie talkie connection with you. If they accept, then you can speak to each other with walkie talkie whenever you like. And to do this, you just press to talk, and then your friend can hear your voice just like a walkie talkie. And they're going to feel a [inaudible] beep beep sound right before your voice comes out. And this new watch-to-watch connection works over cellular or Wi-Fi, and it has really high audio quality. And it's a lot of fun. We can't wait for you to try this out. That's walkie talkie. [ Applause ] Now last year we introduced a Siri watch face, which presents the right information to you at the right time. And Siri does this using machine learning, so it's going to get better at predicting your actions over time by combining inputs like the time of day, your location, your daily routines, or which apps you use when. We're making some great enhancements to the Siri watch face now. First, we're adding new content. So now you can get live sports scores, you can get commute time home or to work, or you can see your heart rate, for example, after a workout or your resting heart rate. And we're also adding Siri Shortcuts. So the shortcuts you saw coming to iOS 12 are also going to be available in watchOS. So in addition to getting relevant information, you'll also receive predicted shortcuts right on the Siri watch face. So in a wrist raise, you'll be able to directly do things like turn on your leaving home scene or start an outdoor walk or play your favorite morning playlist. And these shortcuts app based on whether you typically do those actions at those times. So super easy now to just tap and do those actions. Also for the first time, you can now use third party apps on the Siri watch face. So now you can see both relevant content and shortcuts from your favorite apps. [ Applause ] So if you always go running with Nike Plus Run Club at a certain time or you're logging your meals with LoseIt or you use City Mapware to find your commute home, you just raise your wrist and tap, it's that easy. So new content, support for Shortcuts, and third-party apps making for an even more powerful Siri watch phase. Now currently to talk to Siri you raise your wrist and you say, hey Siri. And when you think about this, it's quite a strong signal when you raise your wrist and talk to your watch. It's kind of like when someone's standing right in front of you, you don't need to say hey because you have their attention already, so we're bringing this same social cue to Siri on the watch so you no longer need to say, hey Siri. You just raise your wrist and talk to Siri. [applause] Now we're also bringing a number of improvements to Notifications, which are now more actionable and interactive. So, for example, with this notification from Quantis, you can check in and share your flight details right from the notification. After you finish a ride with Dee, you can scroll down. You can rate your ride and pay with Apple Pay right there in the notification. And with this one from Yelp that your table is ready, if you need a bit more time, you can extend the reservation out a bit just by tapping here. So super easy now to interact right in place inside Notifications. We've also improved our Message notification. Today if someone sends you a weblink, you aren't able to view it on your list. With watchOS 5, we've integrated WebKit, so now you have the ability to view web content and mail or messages. You can even tap on that link, yes, to easily view things like menus here. And while we think full browsing doesn't make sense on your wrist, there are times you get content. You'd like to see it right in the moment, and now you'll be able to do that and watch OS 5. And the contents can be formatted for the small screen, and the where reader made is available, it uses that on the watch. So WebKit on watchOS. [ Applause ] Now with watchOS 4, we introduced an entirely new way to listen to music while you're on the go. You can stream 48 million songs on your wrist with Apple, or you can listen to automatically synced and created play lists. And now with watchOS 5, we're giving you even more to listen to. [ Applause ] That's right. The Apple podcast app is coming to Apple Watch. Upcoming episodes from subscribed podcasts will be automatically synced to your watch, so you can get them right there, or you can just ask Siri to stream a podcast for you, and it'll start playing and playback resume across all your devices so you can continue just where you left off. So that's Podcast. Now those are the great new features coming in watchOS 5. So stay connected with people and information that you care most about, interactive notifications, web content, new content and shortcuts in the Siri face, podcasts and of course walkie talkie. Now we'd like to show you this stuff live in action, and we thought we'd increase the challenge a bit in our live demo here today to keep it interesting. So, Jules, who helps lead our fitness experiences, is actually going to do the demo while biking. [ Applause ] So Jules has expertise in coaching, and she knows how to move and demonstrate and motivate all at the same time. Take it away, Jules. >> Thank you, Kevin. I've got some great stuff to show you that I think you're really going to love, and the bonus is, I get to work on closing my rings while I do it. So, first, I'm super excited to show you how easy it is to start a workout with GymKit. I just tap to connect and accept on the watch, and now I can control and start the workout right here from the console on the bike. All of my data between the watch and the bike is in sync, and all of my workout metrics are accurate. Now, I wouldn't typically be trying to demo things for you and sneak in a workout at the same time, but I want to show you activity competitions. And to do that, I need to keep moving. This morning I got this notification, and it says, your competition with Jay is down to the last day, and it's a close one. Have you got what it takes to win? Have I got what it takes? You bet I do. [ Applause ] But if I scroll down, I can see that Jay has moved ahead of me by a couple of points, and that's not okay because this thing ends tonight. So, I think I'm going to add a little resistance to this workout here and work to earn as many points as possible and move ahead of Jay by the time this demo is done. I can simply tap here and send him a little smack talk to let him know I'm coming for him. Let me show you interactive notifications because I have a dinner reservation tonight that I made through Yelp. If all goes well here, I'm going to go out with my girlfriends from work to celebrate. And because we all know that Jay is going to lose this competition, maybe I should invite him along so it can be his treat. Now I can simply add to the number of guests and confirm right here in the app without ever having to open it. It's that simple. [ Applause ] Now in watchOS 5, notifications from apps are smartly grouped together, and here are a couple messages from my friend Catherine. We're trying to get to a yoga retreat this summer, and it looks like she sent me a link. Now, I can tap it here and see if she's found somewhere great for us to go. Oh yeah, this looks beautiful. I'm already in, but I can continue to scroll through the site and maybe read a little bit more about the retreat, even check the dates to make sure that they work. And I can do all that right here from my wrist. [ Applause ] Let me show you the enhancements that we've made to the new Siri watch face. At the top here, you see the workout that I'm in right now, and when I'm ready to get back to it, I can just tap. Next up is Glow Baby, because it's about this time each day that I check the app to see if my husband has logged our one-year-old's nap. Oh, good job, baby. You slept two hours, and you parents know that good naps equal good nights, so I'm looking forward to that. AR. As I scroll through my day, I can see my next meeting. I can see traffic and directions to places that I'm going later today. Here's that dinner that Siri found in my calendar, and waiting for me at the end of my day is a shortcut to my evening meditation or ten percent happier, nice. Now, I want to check back in on this competition, but I thought it might be a good idea to get a little moral support from my number one fan. And you heard Kevin say how walkie talkie is so great for staying in touch with close friends and family. So I set my daughter up with walkie talkie so that she can help demo what it's like to receive one and maybe give me a little bit of love up here. Oh, there she is. >> Mommy, I see you on TV. >> Isn't that fun? How am I doing? >> So good. I know you'll beat Uncle Jay, #mommyforthewin. >> Thanks Peach. I love you. [ Applause ] And that's how walkie talkie works. AR. The time is now to check in on this competition and see if I have done enough to pull ahead. I'm going to tap into activity and swipe over to see the score. Oh, yes. [ Applause ] Sorry Jay, but the day is still young. Thanks everybody, and back to you, Kevin. [ Applause ] >> Way to go, Jules. So in watchOS 5 we've enabled even deeper integration on the watch for apps, enabling them to work right in the moment. And apps can include interactive controls within notifications so you can quickly do more without even opening an app like extend your parking with Pay by Phone. And with Shortcuts, there's also new opportunities for third-party apps to appear on Apple Watch right on the watch face. You can tap on a shortcut on the Siri face to order coffee, rent a bike, or pick up where you left off in a workout. You can even use your custom Siri commands that you created on your phone to speak on your watch. And for native apps building rich experiences, we've improved the workout API for greater performance, and we've added the ability for third-party apps to play background audio. [ Applause ] This enables you to easily sync things, of course, like audio books, favorite playlists, guided meditations right to your watch and to be able to play continuously in the background. Now there are so many other features coming into watchOS including things like the ability to customize the button arrangement in your control center, or you can add an air quality complication to your watch face, but one really exciting one is student ID cards. You're going to have the ability to add your student ID card to wallet on your iPhone and Apple Watch. And this works by simply holding your watch near a meter anywhere you can use your student ID cards on and off campus. You can get access to places like your dorm or the library or events on campus. You can even pay for things like snacks or laundry or dinners, and this works with your watch or your phone, and it will be available this fall starting with these universities and will expand to more campuses over time. [ Applause ] Now this is also Pride month, and we're really excited to introduce an all-new Pride education watch band. [ Applause ] And we didn't stop there. We made a beautiful new face that matches perfectly with the band. [ Applause ] And the face and the band are available today. And if you'd like to use the new watch face, you can choose to add it from the watch face gallery starting at noon today. That's just some of what's coming in watchOS 5. Thank you very much. Back to Tim. [applause] >> Thanks Kevin. Thank you, Kevin. WatchOS just keeps getting better and better, and we're excited for you to try all of these great new features to help you stay more active and connected. Next up is Apple TV. Last September, we introduced Apple TV 4K, and our customers love it. Since its introduction, the Apple TV business has grown an incredible 50 percent. Today, we've got some great new enhancements to Apple TV 4K and tvOS, and we think you're going to love them. So I'd like to invite Apple TV lead designer, Jen Fuls [phonetic] to the stage to tell you all about it. Jen. [applause] >> Thanks Tim. [ Applause ] Apple TV is built on an incredible platform, tvOS. And tvOS is built specifically for the living room, to make it easy to enjoy your favorite TV shows, movies, apps, and games. Now as Tim mentioned, last September, we introduced Apple TV 4K with the goal of bringing the highest quality cinematic experience right to your home. It offers both 4K and high dynamic range, including support for HDR 10 and Dolby Vision. Time said, the new Apple TV is a high fidelity powerhouse. And to ensure you can enjoy this beautiful experience with as much content as possible, iTunes offers the largest collection of 4K HDR movies. [ Applause ] And we've upgraded your previously purchased movies to 4K HDR for free on all available titles. There are also, thank you, there are also many 4K and HDR TV shows available from popular services like Amazon Prime video and Netflix. And we know what makes for an amazing cinematic experience is not just great picture quality. It's also incredible sound. So Apple TV 4K is bringing you the latest in audio technology, Dolby Atmos. [ Applause ] With Atmos, you get room-filling sound. The perfect complement to the stunning visuals of Apple TV 4K. Now what makes Atmos so special is that unlike a traditional surround sound setup, where sound is assigned to channels like the left or the right, Dolby Atmos has the ability to completely immerse you. Atmos moves sound in three-dimensional space, creating an experience with powerful audio that flows all around you. It puts you right in the center of the action. All this with a home theater setup as simple as a Dolby Atmos enabled soundbar and an Apple TV 4K. In fact, Apple TV 4K is the only streaming player to be both Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos certified. [ Applause ] And this Fall, iTunes will be bringing you the largest collection of Atmos content anywhere. And just like with 4K HDR, your iTunes libraries will be upgraded to include Dolby Atmos on all supported titles for free. [applause] Now of course these movies and so much more are available in the Apple TV app. The Apple TV app is the center of your video experience, a single place to find and watch what you love across your favorite apps. It's on Apple TV, iPad and iPhone where you can find not only On Demand TV shows and movies but also live content including sports. The Apple TV app now offers a huge range of live sports. And we've added live news to make it even easier to stay current. The edition of live sports and news providers brings the coverage of the TV app to over 100 video channels, giving you a massive selection of content all in one place. With all this, Apple TV is the best box to connect to your TV. And that's now more true than ever as more and more cable companies fundamentally shift how video gets to your TV. This typical cable box is becoming a thing of the past as these companies embrace internet-based delivery. And many of them share our vision of Apple TV as the one device for live, On Demand, and Cloud DVR content. And we've already started working with partners around the world to make this a reality. In France, we're working with Canal Plus. Almost a third of French households subscribe to Canal services, and their subscribers can now choose Apple TV to access more than 100 live channels and some of the biggest sports including the French Open in 4K. In Switzerland, we've partnered with Salt. Salt just launched a new TV service with more than 300 live TV channels, and it's available exclusively on Apple TV. And I'm really excited to announce that here in the U.S., Charter Spectrum will be coming to Apple TV late this year. [ Applause ] That means that up to 50 million homes will be able to choose Apple TV to access all their live channels and thousands of On Demand programs. And, they'll be able to use Siri and the TV app to get access to their TV service not only on Apple TV but on iPhone and iPad as well. Now with nearly any cable subscription, you can get access to dozens of video channels like ESPN, Showtime, NBC, and many more, but it used to be really painful to set up, having to authenticate each app individually. I'm sure all of you have seen that six-digit code you have to go online and type into a web browser. Well, last year we introduced single sign-on. Enter your cable credentials only once, and we unlock all of the apps your subscription supports. Well now we're making it even easier with zero sign-ons. [ Applause ] So now if you're on your TV provider's broadband network, we'll securely and automatically unlock all the supported apps included with your TV service. No credentials needed. It just works. Charter Spectrum [applause]-- this is really awesome-- and Charter Spectrum will be the first to support zero sign-on and we'll be adding more providers over time. We're also giving you even more options for ways to control your Apple TV. For example, you can get quick access on your iPhone where Apple TV users will get the Apple TV remote automatically added to control center. And, for those that have installed home control systems, we're working with the leading providers so that you can use their remotes to control your Apple TV, even including support for Siri. At Apple, I love working with an amazing team designing for a product that I enjoy every day and on the biggest screen in my home. I get to watch all my favorite movies, TV shows and more. Over 40 million songs including the best metal on Apple Music. All of my photos, videos, and memories as well as thousands of apps and games that many of you have built. And, Apple TV brings some amazing views right to my living room with Aerials. Now, one of the questions I get asked the most about Aerials, especially by my family members is where is this? Well, this ball with just a tap of the Siri remote, you'll now be able to see every Arial location. [ Applause ] And, you can even swipe between locations so you can see even more. And today, I have an incredible new location to share with you. For the past year, we've been collaborating closely with an amazing partner, filming some stunning footage from around the world with a very unique vantage point, and here it is. Earth. [ Applause ] This is filmed by astronauts aboard the International Space Station. You can see Sicily just off the boot of Italy, and check out that Mediterranean Sea. The blue is just phenomenal. So here's a fun fact. The Space Station makes an orbit every 90 minutes, so that means they get 16 sunrises and sunsets every day. And with all those sunsets, nighttime can be particularly stunning the way those urban areas pop with light. Here we are flying over South Korea toward Japan. You can see Tokyo coming into view at the top, some distant stars, and even upper reaches of the Earth's atmosphere, which is that orange band enveloping the Earth. And here's one that might look a little more familiar. This is the Northern California coast heading southward. You can see Lake Tahoe surrounded by snowcaps and the San Francisco Bay. These are truly incredible and offer such a unique perspective on the world. I'd like to give a huge thanks to the International Space Station National Lab and CASIS for all their help in making this a possibility. [ Applause ] These are going to look incredible at home in 4K HDR. So that's tvOS. Apple TV gives you amazing picture and sound with 4K HDR and now Dolby Atmos. And the Apple TV app is the center of your video experience. Available on Apple TV, iPad, and iPhone, it's the one place to find all your favorite TV shows, movies, sports, and news. And with that, I'll hand it back to Tim. Thank you. [ Applause ] >> Thanks Jen. Apple TV 4K and tvOS look and sound awesome. You're really going to love it. Next up is the Mac. At Apple [applause]-- yeah. We love the Mac. The Mac was the first computer that made powerful technology so easy to use and put the customer at the center of the experience. And of course that remains at the core of all Apple products. For more than 30 years, the Mac has empowered people to create all kinds of amazing things, from the personal to the professional. Today, we're excited to take Mac a huge leap forward. The next version of macOS is chock full of new features inspired by pro-users but designed for everyone. I'd like to bring Craig back up to talk about it. Craig. [ Applause ] >> Hello again. It's true that macOS is the heart of what makes a Mac a Mac. And we want as many Mac users as possible to have access to our latest software, and that's why six years ago with the introduction of OS 10 Mavericks, we began offering our macOS updates free for Mac users. And 2013 was also the year that we first introduced our California naming theme. Now after spending a year by the ocean, we not only modernized the look and feel of macOS, but we headed to the mountains with macOS Yosemite. Now, as you may be aware, our naming of Mac releases is handled by our crack marketing organization, and as you've probably noticed, they went on a four-year mountain-bound bender. [laughter] In El Capitan we added metal, our ground-breaking graphics technology. In Sierra, we brought Siri to the Mac and extended our capabilities and continuity. And last year with High Sierra, we focused on deep technology, preparing the Mac for future innovation. Well this year, we made some striking changes to macOS, and we've left the high country for a place entirely different but not less beautiful and here still in California, and I'd like to take you there now. Our next release of macOS is macOS Mojave. [ Applause ] Now, Mojave is beautiful during the day, but what really captured our imagination was the beauty of the desert at night. And this inspired one of our most distinctive new features, and I'd like to show it to you now. So here we are live in macOS Mojave, and I'd like to show you a new side of Mojave. We call it dark mode. [ Applause ] And as you see, dark mode is not just about the dock or the menu bar. It extends to your Windows Chrome, your sidebar, and even the content of the Windows, and it's so great for Pros. It makes photographic content absolutely pop off the screen. It's just gorgeous. It's so nice. And this is great not just for photography but when working on presentations or documents. It's also great doing ordinary things. Maybe you're working in a dark environment. Just look at calendar. Even mail in dark mode. It's so great. And I think some of us are going to want to run dark mode just because it's so cool. I mean your emoji look great. Your photos look great. I mean check out your album art and music or your For You feed in Apple Music. But I think one audience that's going to especially appreciate dark mode are some of you here in this room, our developers, because Expo looks fantastic in dark mode. [ Applause ] Whether it's your source code or even interface builder and all of its inspectors, they just look fantastic in black. And that's a quick look at dark mode. Now, we were so inspired by this changing desktop wallpaper that we decided to add a new feature to Mojave that I think you'll enjoy. It's called dynamic desktop, and when you're using it, you're desktop actually subtly changes throughout the day from morning, to afternoon, to evening. It's really cool. Now, there's much more to Mojave that I'd like to share with you through demos, and it starts with the desktop. Now, the desktop is so crucial to how many of us use our Macs. When we have files that we're actively working on, we often put them on the desktop, but the result can be a desktop that looks something like this. And so now in Mojave we have a really great solution, and we call it Desktop Stacks. [ Applause ] All of the contents of your desktop are automatically arranged into these stacks, and they can be arranged by kind, by date, or even by tag, and they're really easy to use. You just click on them. You can see all the contents in the stack. You can double click to open a document and put it away. And they stay organized. So for instance, if I bring forward mail, maybe I drag an image out, I want you to watch what happens because the image flies right into the right stack. Now you can also scrub your stacks. So, for instance, I'll just scrub across this stack. You see I can select between different photos, pick one up. Actually let me just hide mail here mid drag. I got a little excited with my, with all of my stack action. So I can just drag this out and drop it in just like that. And that's a quick look at Stacks. Now-- [ Applause ] We've also brought some great new changes to the finder. I'd like to show them to you now. Now it starts with a new view. We all enjoy using icon view, list view. There's of course column view, but now we've added an all-new view called gallery view. It has a big preview up top, a set of thumbnails along the bottom, and it makes it easy to preview images, video, presentations, documents, spreadsheets, PDFs, and of course with images sometimes you want to know more detail about, for instance, how they were captured, and now the new sidebar in Mojave really helps because it now supports full metadata, so you can see around your photo, the camera you took the photo on, the kind of lens, the aperture settings, and so forth. It's really handy. And you'll notice also along the bottom there's this new area called Quick Actions, and Quick Actions that you act on the current photo. So, for instance, if I have a photo like this and I want to edit it, I don't have to open it and go through a new app. I can rotate it right here inside the finder. It's really powerful. Now this sidebar is available in other views of the finder. So for instance, I'm just going to bring up the preview pane here, and I'm going to do a multi selection of a PDF as well as several images, and you'll notice that the quick actions area is contextual, so it shows me create PDF as an option. I'm going to click create PDF, and it's going to assemble all of these photos into a PDF just like that. But what's really great is these actions are also customizable, so you can create automator actions and assign them to buttons here inside of Finder. So you'll notice that now that I have this PDF selected, I have an option to run a custom automator action that I've created called Watermark PDF. When I click it, my custom action runs, and my document is watermarked, just like that. And those are some quick enhancements to the finder. [ Applause ] Now a tool that I think many of us love when working with files is Quick Look, and now in Mojave, we made Quick Look more powerful than ever by integrating Markup. Let me show you how it works. So you see down here I have a permission slip and it's a PDF document. I'm just going to hit tap spacebar to Quick Look it, and you notice now I have the option to invoke Markup. I click, and now I have access to my markup tools, including my ability to sign this document. I can just drag out my signature like this, and I'm done. Now this works for all kinds of files. So, for instance, with images I can rotate and crop, and with video I can even trim right here inside of Quick Look. And that's a quick look at Quick Look. [ Applause ] Next, I want to talk about how we capture content on our Mac because one of the tools I think many of us use all the time is Screenshots, and we've made Screenshots more powerful than ever in Mohave. So let's take a look here at a webpage, and I'm just going to take a screenshot in the traditional way. I'm going to screen shot a selection of the page, and I want you to watch what happens in the lower right. I get a thumbnail instantly of that screenshot, and when I double click in, I get an accelerated workflow right into Markup where I have access to all of my tools. So, for instance, if I want to create a magnification here, I can just drag that out. Magnify. It's that easy. But now we've also made it easier to access a variety of tools, so when I bring up my screenshotting, you see I'm presented with this hud that tells me I can capture the entire screen, a selected window or selection, but we've also added screen capture for video right into screenshotting. Let me show you how that works. So I'm going to go to a webpage here that has an animation running. I'm going to bring up my screenshotting tools, and say record the selected area. I'll just make a nice selection here. Okay. And I'm recording just like that. Of course I can manipulate the app, so all will be reflected in my recording, and when I'm done, I can click the stop button right up here. And now you notice I have this thumbnail in the lower right. Well I can actually pick this up and drag it into a new space and incorporate it right into a document, just like that. Now, we've further enhanced the way you capture content, and that brings me to Continuity. So Mac users love Continuity for the way it lets us work across our devices with things like Air Drop or the ability to unlock your Mac using your Apple Watch. When it comes to capturing content, we'll walk around with one of the best content capture devices in the world in our pockets, our phones. And so we wanted to take advantage of continuity to bring that to the Mac with a feature we call Continuity Camera. Let me show you how it works. So here in my Keynote presentation, I have a space that's just waiting for a new photo, and on my phone right here. Well, when I select this object, I can choose to take a photo. And I want you to watch what happens when I select this to my phone. It automatically immediately lights up ready to take a photo. So I can take one like this, and when I do, I can select use photo, and it apps directly in my document. Isn't that cool? [ Applause ] Now, this works as well for scanning documents. So here I have a place where I could use a scan. Once again, I'm going to select from the menu and this time scan document. Again, my camera lights up, this time right in my document scanner. I just scan like this. I can save it. And my scan goes immediately, and I think I forgot to push the save button. Sorry about that everybody. There you go, appears immediately in my document. Thank you. [applause] And so just like that I can take photos, stills, and even capture video, and this is a quick look at some great new features in Mojave. [ Applause ] Next, I'd like to turn to apps. We are bringing News to the Mac. [ Applause ] Now News has all of the stories you've come to expect from News on iOS, and it looks amazing on the Mac display. You get top stories picked by our editors, trending stories, you're personalized for you and that's not for me, and you also get this great new sidebar where you can drill in and jump right to the topics and channels you follow. News is going to be great. We also have Stocks coming to the Mac. Now you get your stock prices combined with high-quality business news delivered from Apple News. It shows you your watch list with your prices on the left, and you can drill in to this interactive chart to get more information and, of course, great news. We're also bringing Voice Memos to the Mac. Now Voice Memos is the most popular voice recorder on iOS, and so many of us use it to capture music recordings or lectures, and now that Voice Memos syncs via iCloud to your Mac, you can take those recordings that you make and for instance drag them right into Garage Band as the foundation for a song. Finally, thrilled to announce Home is coming to the Mac as well. [ Applause ] You have all of your accessories here. You can run your scenes as well as monitor your video cameras, and of course with Siri you can command your home with your voice. So those are four great new apps coming to Mojave. [ Applause ] Next, I'd like to talk about security and privacy. You know, one of the reasons that people choose Apple products is because of our commitment to security and privacy. And we believe that your private data should remain private, not because you've done something wrong or that you have something to hide but because there can be a lot of sensitive data on your devices, and we think you should be in control of who sees it. Now, to begin we protect your information on your devices using state of the art hardware and software, and this year we're adding greater protections about how apps can access that information. Today, Apple devices check in with you before granting an app access to information like your location. You could tell because you'll see an alert just like this one, and macOS already provides API-level protections for things like contacts, photos, calendar, and reminders, but now in Mojave, we're extending these protections to include your camera and your microphone as well as protecting sensitive parts of your file system, like your mail database, your message history, and your backups. And all of this is protected by default for any app that you run on the system, an important protection. [ Applause ] Next, I want to turn to some great enhancements to Safari. Safari works really hard to protect your privacy, and this year it's working even harder. Last year, we introduced intelligent tracking prevention to dramatically reduce the ability for apps to track you across websites using cookies. This is the kind of thing where you look at a product on one site. Then you move to another site and another site and somehow this is just following you wherever you go. Well, we've all seen these, these like buttons and share buttons and these comment fields. Well, it turns out these can be used to track you, whether you click on them or not, and so this year we are shutting that down. [ Applause ] Now if you do want to interact with one of these or one of these apps tries to access that information, you'll get this, and you can decide to keep your information private. Now next let's talk about Fingerprinting. You know, data companies are clever and relentless, and in addition to cookies, they use another method called Fingerprinting. And here's how it works. Just like you can be identified by a fingerprint, it turns out that when you browse the web, you're device can be identify by a unique set of characteristics, like its configuration, its fonts that you have installed and the plug-insulin that you might have on the device. And these data companies can use the set of characteristics to construct a unique fingerprint to track your device from site to site. With Mojave, we're making it much harder for trackers to create a unique fingerprint. We're presenting webpages with only a simplified system configuration. We show them only built-in fonts, and Legacy plug-insulin are no longer supported, so those can't contribute to a fingerprint, and as a result, your Mac will look more like everyone else's Mac, and it will be dramatically more difficult for data companies to uniquely identify your device and track you. [ Applause ] Now, we're bringing all of these new protections to Safari on both Mojave and iOS 12. Next, let's talk about the mac App Store, and to do that, I'd like to invite to the stage Anne Tye, our product marketing manager for the App Store. Anne. [ Applause ] >> Last year, we launched a completely redesigned App Store on iOS. Every day, we celebrate apps, games, and developers. We've written more than 4000 stories for the New Today tab, and hundreds of them have each been read by more than a million people. The response has been incredible, and we've learned a lot. We've got a bunch of great new features coming later this year that we'll cover in sessions. This year, we are turning our attention to the Mac App Store. [applause] Since it launched in 2011, it's changed the way we download and install software for Mac, making it easy with one click. It's the biggest catalogue of Mac apps in the world. It's also a trusted and safe place to download software. Entrusting where you get your apps from has become more important than ever. Developers can distribute their apps to 155 countries and get worldwide payment processing, and it offers seamless software updates from one place. This adds up to a great experience for our users. We've spent a lot of time thinking about what people do on their Macs and wanting to create a place organized around those themes. So we've redesigned an all new Mac App Store from the ground up, and we're thrilled to show it to you now. [ Applause ] It's got a beautiful UI that should feel familiar but new and designed first and foremost to be a great Mac app. Starting with the new discover tab where each week you can find in-depth editorial about the best Mac apps through stories and collections and see what's most popular with top charts. Here's a story about musician and founder Karim Morsy. Learn about how he uses his app, Djay Pro 2, and get inspiration for your own set. Helpful videos auto play, so you can see what apps are capable of before downloading them. Visit the all-new create, work, play, and develop tabs where you'll find helpful recommendations and expertise around each theme. Here's the create tab where you can find apps that bring your artistic ideas to light. These tabs will also help you make the most of apps you might already have with tips and tutorials even the most expert users will find useful. The work, play, and develop tabs share the same beautiful design, and you can still browse by category on the categories tab. We've redesigned product pages too, bringing many features over from iOS based on our learnings there. It has more useful information like video previews available on the Mac App Store for the first time, an apps rank if it's charting and if it's been named editor's choice. Ratings and reviews are now front and center, and these are so important for app discovery. So we're introducing a ratings and review API for Mac apps. Now, it'll be easier than ever for people to leave feedback. We're really excited about the all-new Mac App Store. We've talked to some developers already, and they're really excited too. Like Microsoft, who will bring Office 365 to the Mac App Store later this year. [ Applause ] And Adobe is bringing Lightroom CC. Panic is bringing Transmit. And Bare Bones is bringing BB Edit. [applause] And many more great names are coming to the all-new Mac App Store too. We can't wait for you to check out the new Mac App Store. Now, I'll hand it back to Craig. [ Applause ] So we think the Mac App Store is going to inspire whole-new generations of apps, and so we want to talk about some of the technologies that will be behind some of that next generation. We spoke earlier about ARKit. I want to talk about two more. And let's start with Metal. Now Metal is the technology to get the highest performance graphics and computation from graphics processors. Metal was designed for modern GPUs. It's incredibly efficient, and that enables amazing console-level games like Fortnight from Epic to run great for the first time on mobile. But Metal also enables these games to scale to take full advantage of modern Macs. In fact, across iOS and the Mac, there are over one billion Metal-enabled devices, and we're constantly making Metal better. To bring the highest GPU performance in reach of all Macs, we've recently added support for external GPUs, and this is powered by Metal, and the results are truly mind boggling. For instance, running a filter in DaVinci Resolve, look at how it scales on the incredibly fast iMac Pro as you add up to four eGPUs. Now, the results are even more staggering when you take a 13-inch MacBook Pro and add eGPUs to it, achieving up to 8.5 times speedup. It's pretty awesome. Now, eGPUs also enable Macs to achieve all-new levels of performance and realism in 3D rendering and gaming. Now this beautiful forest you see here, this isn't a video capture. This is from Unity's new Book of the Dead interactive demo, and it's being rendered live right now on a MacBook with an eGPU powering this display. I mean doesn't this look amazing? [ Applause ] Now, of course because this is rendered live, we can check what's up ahead, so let's start walking. Now Unity is using Metal's unified graphics and compute to generate real-time lighting and complex post-processing effects. So cool. And that's all rendered live on a MacBook running with an eGPU. It's pretty great. [ Applause ] Now another place where we're doing incredible acceleration with Metal is in machine learning. And today ML specialists usually use one of these third-party libraries to train their models using servers, and now it turns out we can accelerate tools like this with our new Metal performance shaders. We're seeing speedups of up to 20 times and using the GPU with Metal instead of CPU-based training. And while speeding these tools up is great, we actually thing there's a better way for most developers, and that's training on the Mac you already have using a great new tool we call Create ML. [ Applause ] Now, Create ML is designed to let you train without being a machine learning expert. You can train vision and natural language models. You can bring your own custom data, and it's really easy to use because it's all built in Swift. In fact, you can use Xcode Playgrounds to train your model. Just drag one in, you're training set, you can drag in your test set as well, and the training is all GPU accelerated, so it's incredibly fast. Now, as an example, we worked with Memrise. They're a developer who uses the camera to identify objects and speak them in multiple languages, and in the past, they would train their model with 20,000 images, and it would take them 24 hours to do so. Well now with Create ML, they can train that same model in 48 minutes on a MacBook Pro. [ Applause ] And on iMac Pro, it's just 18 minutes. And what's even more incredible is that model in the past for them was 90 megabytes, and now it's just three megabytes. It's a huge difference. [ Applause ] Now we also are making models run much faster on device using Core ML 2. Now Core ML is our technology for high performance on-device machine learning, and now it's better than ever. It's 30 percent faster in on-device processing using a technique called batch predictions, and you can reduce your model size by up to 75 percent using quantization. And so that's Core ML and Create ML. You no longer have to be an expert in machine learning to build those techniques into your app. Now, these technologies are redefining what's possible in apps, and they're common not just to macOS but also to iOS, and the fact that the mac and iOS share so much technology has led people almost every year to keep asking us the question, are you merging iOS and macOS? So I'd like to take a moment to briefly address this question. No. Of course not. [ Applause ] We love the Mac because it's, and we love macOS because it's explicitly created that a unique characteristics of Mac hardware, like the ergonomics of the keyboard and the trackpad, the flexibility in displays and storage and because of the power it exposes. It makes the Mac able to accomplish almost anything. So we think that this question is actually coming from something else. You know, Mac users have access to a rich set of great native applications, apps that take full advantage of the power of Mac technologies. But Mac users also use apps based on other technologies. We routinely access web-based experiences like Netflix that build on WebKit, the standards-based web technology in Safari, and we also run sometimes cross-platform games built on technology like metal. And all of these platforms enrich the Mac user's experience. But we think there's room for one more, and so we'd like to give you a sneak peek of a multiyear project we have going on. Because we see a huge opportunity for the Mac to tap into the world's most vital app ecosystem. It's called iOS. I think you might be familiar with it. Now, there are millions of iOS apps out there, and we think some of them would be absolutely great on the Mac, and Mac users would love to have them there. And from a technical standpoint, it's actually a really good fit because from day one iOS and macOS have shared common foundations. But iOS devices and Mac devices of course are different, and the user interfaces are somewhat different and so the frameworks underneath are as well. And that makes today porting an app from one to the other some work. We wanted to make this much easier, and so we've taken some key frameworks from iOS and brought them to the Mac. And we've adapted them to specific Mac behaviors like use of trackpad and mouse, window resizing, integration of things like copy and paste and drag and drop into the system services on the mac. Now, phase one of this effort is to test it on ourselves. So this year in macOS, we've taken some of our own iOS apps, and we brought them to the Mac using those technologies to make sure it works well. You've actually heard about several of them earlier today, and it turns out they make fantastic Mac apps, and we're able to bring them to the Mac with very few code changes. Now, this is going to be coming to you developers next year. So you can easily bring your iOS apps to the Mac, and in the meantime, we hope you enjoy News, Stocks, Voice Memos, and Home in Mojave. Now we're really excited about Mojave. From desktop, Stacks, to Finder with gallery view to enhanced screenshots and markup, News and Home on the Mac for the first time. Stocks and of course the redesigned Mac App Store. And of course there's even more. Like APFS now supports Fusion and hard drives, and Safari tabs can now have favicons if you want them there. And, of course, Group Facetime. So that's macOS Mojave. I hope you like it. I'm going to hand it back to Tim. Thank you so much. [ Applause ] >> Thank you, Craig. What a huge update to macOS and what an extraordinary morning. We got started with iOS 12 with all-new capabilities including taking AR further than ever before, bringing Siri to any app with Siri Shortcuts and ScreenTime and cool new communication features like Memoji and Group Facetime. And watchOS, now with Walkie Talkie, Activity, Competitions, New Workouts, New Siri Capabilities, and so much more. And Apple TV 4K now with Adobe Atmos, some great new partnerships, and the ease of zero sign-on. And you're going to really love those new Aerial screensavers. And macOS Mojave with all new dark mode, great updates to desktop and finder, enhanced privacy and security, and a completely redesigned Mac App Store. The updates will be available to our users this Fall, and there will be developer betas for each of them after the Keynote this morning. [ Applause ] Thank you. Now, before we close, we wanted to celebrate you and the amazing work that you do, so we went out and talked to some of the most important people in your lives, the ones that know you the best, and we made a short video, and I'd love to run it for you now. [ Music ] >> I don't have any idea at all how to create an app. I don't understand any of it. Ask me another question. >> My son is a developer at Robinhood. >> My daughter, Jody, is a WWDC 2018 scholarship winner. >> My brother started and founded Yelp. >> All the apps. >> Timeless. >> One drop. >> Splitter critters. >> Homework. >> Homework, you talk to her. >> My brother Derek created the app Refugees and Immigrants the creative, the collective. Why did I say the creative. >> At Christmastime, when most kids maybe would want skis or something, he wanted computer books. He stayed in his bedroom, making games while the other kids were outside playing. >> And when she is really doing the coding almost always we have to tell my daughter to stop, but then my daughter will be like, just give me another ten minutes. I want to get this solved first. >> When I watch him code, his eyes move in a weird way, and he's like totally focused. Even when my friends are over, I'd say, we'll look at Christopher, look at him. And they'd go, wow. >> When he first came to us with the idea, we were like, okay, good luck. >> He started off in his small little one-bedroom apartment with next to nothing, and sacrificed eating a burger and just have ramen just so that he could, and I'm like just buy the burger. And he's like no, that's three bucks that I could put towards the app. >> Jeremy went out to build the first version of Yelp, and it was a total bust, a total failure. >> She tried really hard on a couple different titles, and you've never heard of them. And, you know, that's a really rough feeling. >> That was definitely a low point for Jeremy because it was like, hey we got to retool and try again. What Jeremy did notice in the data was that people loved writing comments, and that was really the genesis of the second version of Yelp, which worked. >> You have to be really okay with waking up to failure and then at the end of a whole bunch of failures is something that's great. >> Tessa didn't really think I want to make an app. Tessa found a problem, a food waste which you could use the app to help to solve. >> Emma's grandma was diagnosed with Alzheimer's. She even forgot my daughter's birthday. So Emma tried to search for an app that would help, but she couldn't find it. So she said, you know, why don't we just do it ourselves. >> My husband was a diabetic. That inspired Jeffrey to do something about diabetes, and it's an answer to a lot of people's prayers. >> Jessie won the iPhone game of the year. I couldn't believe that he made it. I mean to me it was remarkable. >> She pulled out her cell phone, and I saw his app on her phone, and I was like trying not to freak out, but oh my gosh. >> For my wife, it's not just creating, it's really wanting to be a part of something big. >> The one lesson that I learned from Jeremy every day is just that determination, tenacity, to focus. He foresaw the impact that the iPhone was going to have, and he bet everything on getting an app for it, and I think that it was one of the most important things that Yelp did. >> I think he's made a big difference, and so do thousands of other people. >> She wants to not just learn also teach others and it makes me really proud to see her blossom. >> As a parent, no better thing is letting your kids do what they want to do, because it isn't how much money you've made. It's really changes you've left behind. And she's hoping to leave a lot of change behind. [ Music ] [ Applause ] >> I love that video, and I'm pleased that some of the developers are in the audience this morning. Their stories are great examples of all of your passion and your creativity. We love the work you do and the impact that it has on the world. It inspires all of us at Apple deeply every day. On behalf of everyone at Apple, thank you. [ Applause ] And I'd also like to thank everyone at Apple who made today possible. Days like this only come from years of effort and hard work and great sacrifice, and so I thank them and their families. Let's have an incredible week together. Thank you. [ Applause ] I came across this article on the verge recently well Apple discuss its MacBook keyboard problems at WWDC WWDC is some Apple event that I don't really follow but apparently they go over things like their new innovations new products new ideas and so on and so forth so it seems like a reasonable question I asked will Apple go over the fact that they have this issue with their keyboards on their $2,300 machines will fail for no reason Casey nice dad is tweeted about it lots of Mac users are aggravated with it you can find that in forums all over the internet it's a clear problem and recently they have gotten sued for it whoops that's the wrong lawsuit recently they've gotten suit ahem reason recently they have gotten sued for it they they get sued so often for faulty products it's hard to keep track of it in my browser tabs so Gerrard Gibbs LLP put up this class-action lawsuit which I will link to below where they're going over the defect and design and why it is people should be compensated for it now this article does pose the fair question what is Apple going to do about it and are they going to address this large problem at their next upcoming presentation where you would expect them to talk about their problems my belief is no I'm gonna present the evidence as to why I believe they're not going to address it in any way even in the form of a discounted warranty based on the trajectory that Apple has been taking with their extended warranties and recall programs over time now even the verge seems to be coming around to the fact that Apple is not going to admit any fault with their own products and I'll read it from their paragraph here on the one hand it's extremely unlike Apple to ever admit that its products are flawed in any way so even if the company does address the keyboard issue it likely would be in the form of some sort of illusion they've updated the keyboards to be even sturdier and more reliable than ever before or something similar instead of outright acknowledging that there's a problem with the old model if the company does offer some extended warranty program for the old problematic models it would probably do so quietly off stage let's talk a little bit about that let's talk a little bit about a history with Apple and their extended warranty programs one of my personal favorites goes back to the 15-inch 2010 MacBook with intermittent black screen or loss of video this is an issue that I cover on my channel extensively if you search for the term see 95/60 it's a capacitor that's the wrong size capacitor that fails on a regular basis for the GPU buck converter circuit for the frame buffer there is some interesting language in here because it seems like they were actually helping people when they were not so this computer came out in 2010 this warranty service program was announced in 2013 so that's three years now Apple will service affected 15-inch MacBook Pro computers free of charge until three years from date of purchase keep in mind Apple will service affected machines free until three years from the date of purchase the warranty program came out in 2013 for a 2010 model now if you do the math there the overlap is such that you had to have bought your product at the end of 2010 to actually make use of this program and even if you did buy it at the end of 2010 but you missed it or you didn't realize that this program was quietly announced and by quietly announced I mean oh link that showed up in Apple support section that they never really published or PR tour alerted people of her email people about you were screwed if you were one of the early adopters of this machine and you bought it earlier in 2010 because you're a serious Apple fan your script then we move on to 2011 and it got a little bit worse than that in 2011 they did not release a warranty program until they were sued so they thought okay we've released another machine with clearly failing GPUs nope three years have passed we're not helping any of you by the beginning of 2014 it was very obvious to any repair store or anybody who works at an Apple Store if you were inundated with lines of people with the green apple that was broken up as it was booting that there were problems with this machine Apple did nothing so this is taking one step further into the realm of a you know we're not release an extended warranty program so there was a class-action lawsuit and about five six months after that class-action lawsuit was announced they wound up releasing another extended warranty program and this extended warranty program was one where they actually fix things but it did take four years after the computer was released for this to come out so if you do the timing there and you look at the machine that they're talking about here this is the 2016 MacBook Pro pictured and this came out around November or December of 2016 you're looking at 40 years you're gonna have to wait until Trump gets reelected just to get an extended warranty program for this machine if that's the timeline that they're following but I don't even think that's what's going to happen here I think that it's not going to happen at all if you'll move even further in time into 2014 you can look at something like the iPhone 6 so the iPhone 6 had something called touch disease you can go over my last video on the iPhone 6 to see that you can view this article on motherboard advice Jason did a very good job covering this issue and you can see even Apple knew from their own internal documents it was more likely to Bend and they still didn't budge that phone has been out for about three and a half years now and the best that they're doing is saying that we will fix it for you for 149 and buy fix it they're not actually going to desolder the chip put an m1 jumper there ball it under fill' a tete cetera they're going to take of motherboard from another phone that was traded in to Apple likely because it had a crack screen likely meaning it was bent likely meaning the board was damaged and they're going to put that into your phone give it a three month warranty and give you the middle finger on day 91 when it fails again this is a trajectory Apple's taking where they're saying you know what no we don't care if users report that there's a mass issue like in 2010 we don't even care if we get sued like what happened in 2011 we're not dealing with this anymore no we're not covering you we're going to fight this in court and we're going to win and apparently they have fought so well in court that there is still no replacement program for the iPhone 6 plus with touch IC issues when their own internal documentation shows it's more likely to bend when it's very clear that this is a widespread issue that specifically affects the six-plus at a disproportionate rate to every other iPhone they are saying no we think we're gonna win in court and so far they've proven that they are gonna win in court because this program is still here they're still charging people 149 bucks to give them a refurbished board in their phone with a three month warranty on a phone that has a resale value now about 250 bucks it's my belief that Apple is not going to announce or discuss their keyboard problems at WWDC and I'm willing to put my money where my mouth is if Apple releases an extended warranty program where they fix keyboard issues for free in these model machines at WWDC I will remove my youtube-channel Apple tried two years ago to get me to take down some videos that I did because they didn't like the fact that there was a portion of the schematic that shows you where the fuses I said I would delete it but only if you filed a DMCA claim and they never followed through with this it's obvious how bad the PR would be on that when your company that likes to brag that you're vice-president of Environment who wins an environmental Achievement Award for greening your supply chain is caught trying to remove videos by force from the internet because somebody is showing their users how to replace a fuse it's very obvious that they'd show is to go for what looked better because they liked it to be able to hurt you signal about their green supply-chain when in reality they'd like you to replace everything with a new one rather than fix what you won't you know because they don't care about being green they care about your green and your green leaving your wallet and going to there so I'm gonna give Apple a really good opportunity for PR here not only would they be able to show all their users that all these people talking about their repair policies and their durability and how they support their customers are wrong but they would be able to remove a source of so much lost income for them in the form of people being able to make their devices work again rather than buy a new one and they'd be able to look good doing it if Apple releases an extended warranty repair program without any BS without any of this oh yeah the machines 2 years old and we're only gonna cover it two years after the date of purchase nonsense where they actually fix the problem with the keyboard for free I will delete my YouTube channel I'm willing to bet that much on it that they are not going to do anything but let me know what do you think do you think apples are going to address their keyboard problems at WWDC do you think they're going to ignore it entirely do you think that they're going to cover it but they're going to say ok instead of charging you five to eight hundred to fix it we'll only charge you one at 200 do you think I'll actually come out and say hey we made a mistake but we're going to fix it by replacing everybody's keyboards for free if you have this issue what do you think they're going to do how do you think they're going to handle this issue into the future and how do you think it's gonna affect sales of their products personally I think this is a turning point where Apple has put too much frustration into a single package the GPU issue was an issue where okay the machine worked for three to four years but then it would start crashing but whatever it was powerful and blah blah blah the iPhone 6 okay you own it for a few years it bends a little bit but it was a really slim phone and it worked really nice when at work but this is a computer that's caused a lot of people a lot of frustration for many different reasons keep in mind that if you owned an iPhone you had to spend $79 on a dongle to attach your new iPhone to your new $2,300 machine that's frustrating you remove the SD card slot that's frustrating you remove the magnetic charger that is frustrating you remove the USB ports an HDMI ports and DisplayPort that is very frustrating and you have tied the computer to a $79 dongle so that you can't even buy a 30 or $40 knockoff dongle like you can with any other PC on the market to that it works they've put a lot of frustration into one device and they also decided to put a new keyboard format a lot of people don't really because it's loud and more weird to type up so it usually Apple packs frustration into small pieces we're gonna remove the firewire port whatever wakin over the optical drive okay whatever we're gonna be the headphone jack whatever but here they've removed all your ports they removed your SD card slot they put in a more annoying keyboard and to top it off the keyboards gonna fail that's a little bit too much frustration for one generation in my opinion and if they don't wind up writing this I think this is going to be the turning point where they start to lose the inertia and get people to go you know what man I hated viruses I hated viruses man and all Windows Vista was oh yeah that was some crap but man his Windows Defender really that bad nowadays is it really that easy to get a virus in Windows does it Adobe Creative Suite works in Windows doesn't it right yeah I think it does man I can use Adobe Creative Suite and Windows can I know most of my apps are on the cloud now said mmm man do it man you know it integrates so nice so nice how it integrates but yeah you're like I got it oh I mean it you stand it great so nicely but now I got to use a $79 dongle it'll attach my phone man oh you know why I mean if I get an Android I can just drag and drop my files onto it using it you know two-dollar USB cable with an O dongle hmm you know you're gonna get people thinking about this stuff and they're gonna realize my mind Oh be creative sweet already what can work on another OS and viruses they're not really that much of an issue anymore it's kind of hard to get a virus on Windows now compared to XP kind of runs fast I know it's dirty it's Microsoft that's you and trust me I'm no fan of Microsoft by any means but apples really given people reasons to switch they've put far too many flaws into one machine they used to put one fatal flaw into a machine not like four or five they've put just enough fatal flaws to piss people off at the point where if they don't address it which I think they won't but if they don't address it they're gonna start seriously losing customers what do you think all right so a couple of weeks ago Michaels T BRR sorry if I'm in gold your name wrote 495 Mac about modernizing the iOS homescreen which right now is this list of pages with rounded square icons with the possible layout for the Apple watch home screen and he had a gif on it which showed interaction with the home screen and I thought it was really nice I noticed up were a lot of little tiny details to it so I thought that could be something interesting to play with so why spend the last couple of days on my free time prototyping this and well it's it works mostly like the Apple watch home screen except there are labels for the icons you can just move around and you can pinch to zoom or zoom in and understand why I have lots of icons just just for giggles and there's two special behaviors for this when we're zoomed out beyond a point if I click anywhere it will zoom towards that region but if I'm close enough then if I tap an icon it launches the app you've got a nice pretty nice animation there that comes out from the center of the circle and while you're zoomed if you tap somewhere that is not an icon it will zoom out so you can see your whole home screen so you can navigate pretty easily all the way from one side to the other of your home screen and it works quite well actually it always snaps to the centre you see that wherever you push it ends up being an icon and up ends up being smacking right smack in the center of the screen and that's it's pretty alright ♪ Who can take a sunrise... ♪ ♪ sprinkle it with dew... ♪

thinks it should! ♪ so every year like clockwork a new iphone comes out that's a little better a little faster a little stronger than the last one and as we know apple is the master of messaging so they give an incredible onstage presentation with unreal video production they paint the simplest prettiest picture of how this is the greatest iphone they've ever made the most powerful fastest iphone we've ever made but they also do something else very important standard practice but they give the phone to reviewers and they don't have to do this but they do and everyone involved will have essentially some date that they are first allowed to talk about their experience with this new phone now i've been a reviewer for years we're professionals our job is to take that week and do all of our testing and take all of our findings and find all the things we like and all the things we don't like and all the new features and test all of the new claims and distill them all down into one piece and that is a review and if you time it all right you can publish that review right when the contract we signed says we're allowed to you might have heard of this it's called an embargo so that's what you're seeing when you see all this first wave of reviews and impressions videos about a product drop at the same time the thing is every single one of these reviews is fundamentally a balancing act because there's limited time there is no possible way to meaningfully test every single new thing about every incredible new phone that comes out and even if you do how much time does that leave for writing down all these tests and then analyzing the results of these tests and that doesn't even leave time for the production of shooting the video of editing the video the color correction the music all the creative choices you want to make there's just too much being a video reviewer on youtube today is like nine different jobs in one so how do you decide what gets included in that review and how much has to hit the cutting room floor so every review has its own style some reviews you'll see are 5 minutes long super dense some might be 10 minutes long even my own videos reviews over the years have gotten somewhere in the 15 to 20 minute range but that's in an effort to give you as much information as possible in as short as time as possible i'm not trying to waste anybody's time and don't forget on youtube we also have audience metrics and retention to think about it's a balancing act so a review is basically the art of compressing and distilling as much useful information as possible into one piece but because it's an art everyone's going to cut different things from different places and make different pieces but not this video in this video there is no time limit this is everything you could possibly want to know about my last five months with the iphone 12 pro and what i really think [Music] all right so now that the limits are off i'm definitely going to be getting into the weeds a pretty good amount and multiple pieces of this video you know when it's happening but i still think it'll be pretty fun when we do it now if you're the madman or mad woman who's just going to watch this whole video straight through to the end well you can see how long this video is it's a good one buckle up grab a snack but if your attention span isn't quite that long well you can see there are chapters below for all these different topics so if you want to get into the weeds on a certain topic you're curious about you can do that too feel free to click around also this video is mainly based on the iphone 12 pro that i've spent most of my last five months with but anytime i reference other pieces of the iphone lineup the 12 mini or the 12 or the 12 pro max i'll mention that too let's get into it [Music] so the iphone 12 series has a refreshed design this year which is always a big deal in the phone world and the iphone design just doesn't change as much as it used to and i think that's pretty important design is really what most people look forward to and what seems to identify the iphone forever i mean think about it most of the time when you see new iphone leaks or headlines or rumors it's mostly design stuff right you're looking at new case designs or new dimensions or what is the camera bump on the back of this year's rectangle going to look like mostly because we already know the next year's iphone is going to be pretty similar to this year's iphone but we just want to know what it's going to look like the look and feel in the hand is always the last most exciting unknown i happen to love the new modern super flat design of the iphone 12 series it's still a rectangle with rounded corners in a few different colors but the sides are flat straight up 90 degrees stand up on the edges flat so the flatness has become this identifying characteristic of the phone just like it was for the iphone 4 4s 5 and 5s but it's actually even flatter than most other flat phones because instead of 2.5 d glass that's flat for most of the surface and then curves over at the very edges this is just straight flat glass on the front and the back and the flat stainless steel band around the edges so this has a couple of effects first it gave apple slightly more internal volume in the same shape second it made the edges a bit sharper so i happen to like the flatter edges just because i feel like it gives me something to hold when i'm picking up the phone gripping it some people though dislike it for the same reason because it can feel a little sharp like it's sort of bumping into the corners of your hand i haven't felt that with this phone the thing i like and dislike the most about this design though is the finishes so all the new iphone 12 pros have this sort of matte finish on the back which is nice it's actually a satin that doesn't show many fingerprints in any light which is awesome it doesn't change much as it wears over time but then you've got a glassy finish on the apple logo the camera bump and the stainless steel band around the outside so the logo that's fine i get it but we know they could have made the camera bump matte because that's what they did on the regular iphone 12 yet they went with a glossy finish just on this piece and then combined with the raised sharp camera rings this has the tendency to collect a lot of dust every iphone 12 pro you see that's been outside of a case for more than a few minutes or put into a pocket is going to have dust around the camera modules this doesn't actually change the performance of the camera so it's actually not a big deal but the dust is pretty much always going to be there because of the rings the most annoying part of the finish on these phones for me though is the fingerprints on the stainless steel rails they are constant so much so that it's not even worth cleaning in the moment when you notice there's fingerprints on it like they've nailed everything else about this rail the power button is slightly bigger and still very clicky love that the mute switch is a staple that still works exactly as you'd expect it to i'll talk more about the rest of the button behavior later but basically my ideal iphone 12 would actually be a hybrid between the matte back of the pro and the matte camera bump and aluminum rails of the regular 12. but guess what most people put their phone in case and so none of that stuff about the finishes about the grippiness about the corners will really actually matter to you that much if you cover up all of this engineering in a plastic shell of your choice the size of the iphone has always been pretty reasonable although it's slowly crept up in size over the years and this is my favorite size iphone ever because it feels just about as big as it can get before i start to have to do hand gymnastics to reach the notification shade and the stuff in the top corner of the screen for whatever reason apple just refuses to adjust the software on the gigantic iphone 12 pro max to really take advantage of that bigger screen in a meaningful way so i found the trade-off in cameras and battery for how annoying it is to use just isn't worth it so the iphone 12 pro is a great size the iphone 12 is an identical size and the 12 mini if you can deal with the battery shortcomings is the best compact flagship phone out there right now i'll link my entire video about that below a couple other things about the design though this is a thousand dollar phone let's not forget that it's a thousand dollars and so there's a lot of these premium design industrial design features and this would be the perfect video to shout out a lot of those things that we typically skip and take for granted so the whole body is sealed and ip68 certified i'm not the type to put it under water and test that but it is able to withstand dust and dirt and is resistant to liquid submersion up to a max depth of six meters underwater for up to 30 minutes so it's always nice to see premium phones that would survive a quick drop in the pool or a toilet or something like that and actually i also used to do a lot more tests if you go back far enough in videos where i would literally try to bend the phone and see if you could hear any flexing or creaking or anything like that phones these days just don't do that anymore and this is no exception so overall just in terms of raw industrial design the iphone is exactly what we'd expected it's great it works great it looks great and it still has the widest most vibrant ecosystem of accessories the worst part about it is technically that lightning port in a world of usb type-c but to most iphone users that's just a default and we already know apple's trying to get rid of that anyway i'll link a video below the like button or right up here in the corner to an entire video i made just about that topic the best part though i still think is actually the most underrated the haptics so i'm putting this in the design section because this is a consideration from the very beginning when apple's laying out the internals of the iphone there is a massive space set aside inside for a very large taptic engine as apple calls it and it's really good so instead of the previously typical rotational vibration motor that taptic engine is a linear oscillating vibrator and it can deliver incredibly precise convincing vibrations that literally feel like taps almost like you're pressing a real button or your phone is tapping you in your pocket and it's better than any other phone's haptics i've felt right now this one in the iphone 12 pro isn't necessarily better than last year but it's just one of those things that we skip because we take it for granted but it's really good apple's gotten so good at haptics that they're comfortable replacing typical buttons like a track pad on a macbook with just a flat piece of glass and a taptic engine underneath it's just it's that good also do i think that this triple camera array looks kind of like a stovetop yes do i think apple knew that when they were making this phone yes but do i think they just went ahead with it anyway because the memes are inevitable and it's kind of also extra press yes so go ahead put a case on it [Music] ah the screen of the iphone always an area of great debate just because how much do people actually care about the display this has always been one of the most controversial areas of the iphone you remember the iphone 10r this is a phone that launched at 749 dollars and had a notably low resolution slightly above 720p lcd screen right and part of the internet went nuts at this like how could apple of all companies be shipping such a garbage screen on paper in a 750 phone when pretty much every other android phone at that price even some cheaper ones were 1080p at least and even i was one of them just holding that phone watching a video on youtube that i knew was 4k max out at 720p just felt borderline unacceptable but it turned out it was fine it was fine people bought the phone they enjoyed it there were blind tests it passed so it felt like all those articles and headlines about this screen were for nothing because apple knew that people didn't really care about this sort of thing as much as we thought they should but this is the same apple that turns around and ships the iphone 12 pro with an incredible screen on paper with dolby vision a slightly higher 1200 nit max brightness and a world-class color accuracy that i guarantee those same people don't notice so the question might not be how good this iphone 12 pro screen is as much as it's how much do people really care about its most controversial traits and to me that's a more fun angle so on paper the iphone 12 pro rocks a flat 6.1 inch diagonal display like i said it's not too huge it's a 2532 by 1170 resolution which puts you at an awesome 460 pixels per inch it's an oled display that maxes out at 1200 nits max brightness which gives it hdr certification and a 2 million to 1 contrast ratio it supports the wide p3 color gamut true tone automatic white balance adjustments and it's coated in a fingerprint resistant oleophobic coating so here's where it gets interesting there's a huge notch at the top so this gigantic cutout stolen from the top of the screen by the biggest notch in any new phone out right now do you care like functionally we all know why the notch is there it's for face id which hasn't really improved over the years as much as i was hoping but it uses an infrared dot projector a receiver and there's an ambient light sensor along with a seven megapixel selfie camera and an earpiece speaker and a mic it feels like this huge notch has sort of faded into our peripheral vision like other phones added notches around the same time as the iphone 10 and then over the years they've all shrunk in their notches doing everything they can to minimize the interruption to a smaller notch than to an even smaller notch and then to a hole punch and then even to developing tech to put the selfie camera behind the display itself so the iphone's notch is still exactly the same it's massive this is one of those things that personally i hate it every time i'm looking at it but i've gotten used to it and apple's done the calculus clearly that most people have gotten used to it and don't mind it and it's just part of the way the iphone is and rumors point to it getting slightly smaller next year but it's not going away anytime soon even if we do get touch id behind the glass in the next iphone we're going to continue to have face id so my take is fine i get it but i would really like face id to start working better specifically at more angles so like when my phone is in front of me on a table or on a desk i wish you could recognize me from that angle and unlock without me moving it or leaning over it because other phones with the fingerprint reader on the front let me do that alright so then there is the refresh rate it's 60 hertz this is as far as i know the most expensive new phone that doesn't have a high refresh rate display yet do you care so my take and you might have seen this coming is i love me some 120 hertz absolutely it's the best thing about a lot of the newest phones coming out makes everything feel smoother and more responsive and once you go 120 hertz it is really hard to go back to 60. except for the iphone the iphone is the smoothest 60 hertz phone so i can kind of feel like the best of the worst or the worst of the best depending on how you look at it so a lot of this has to do with the overall performance of the phone which is great but i'll get into that later but most of this has to do with the 120 hertz touch sample rate meaning the layer beneath the display that tracks the touch input from your finger and tells the display to respond is refreshing twice as many times per second as a normal 60hz display so it feels very responsive and really tight to the way your finger moves on the screen and this is what iphone users are used to so that being said the iphone can still benefit massively from 120hz display and i know this because the ipad pro has had 120hz display since 2017 and it's incredible so i'm bummed that the iphone 12 pro doesn't have a higher frustrated screen and i would be even more bummed if next year it also doesn't but something to note is that ipad pro is an lcd display and one of the main reasons cited by iphone defenders for why this phone doesn't have 120hz display is because they wanted to go oled too and apple couldn't find a supplier that could make as many high quality 120 hertz oleds as they'd need to satisfy their high quality control requirements and millions and millions of units for the iphone so maybe next year i'm really hoping but you know what else they made some pretty big claims about for this iphone screen this new thing called ceramic shield so the front of this new iphone has a layer on top apple's calling ceramic shield which isn't ceramic but it is kinda shield it's actually still glass but with a sort of crystallized reinforcement and apple's big on stage claim for this was four times better drop performance so like i said in my original review video i'm not the one who's gonna go out and drop the phone over and over to try to see if it somehow hits that 4x number but what we did find out is it still scratches out of level six with deeper grooves at a level seven and it will still shatter when dropped it's not some magical next level solution glass is glass and you know the rest thanks zack but if there is any observable improvement in drop performance of the iphone 12 it's most likely result of the new flat design since these phones are so flat the rails are much more likely to take some of that impact damage when you drop it unless the phone lands completely flat on the face which is unlikely so with that stainless steel rail it's gonna absorb a lot of the impact or it could just be whatever screen protector or case you have on your phone not the magic of some ceramic shield so while i do appreciate the effort to trying to make better more resilient glass on the front of the iphone it's not magic oh and speaking of screen protectors this is officially unofficially but officially the easiest new phone to apply a screen protector to because of how perfectly flat it is in case you're into that fun fact so the iphone's display incredible on paper great color accuracy flat plenty bright and sharp but also still has a huge notch at the top still stuck at 60 hertz and still scratches as easily as ever it's glass par for the court there is a lot that goes into the testing of a set of new smartphone cameras and it usually ends up being the longest section of the review just because so many phones have gotten so good that it feels like the camera is one of the last things that really differentiates them but here we are with the iphone 12 pro and its triple camera system so these are all top of the line cameras but you probably already knew that and honestly i could probably have just ended it there like you know you're getting good consistent point and shoot photos high quality videos and a good mic you're set but that's not what you came here for is it so there's a lot more to say about these cameras so first of all the iphone's cameras haven't really changed all that much since they started getting really good a few years ago if it ain't broke they definitely don't fix it here which is funny because the headphone jacks also weren't broken but i guess they didn't feel the same way about that but the point is there's not going to be some huge year-over-year difference with the iphone cameras because they don't have much to change the sensor size is going to stay about the same it's a 12 megapixel optically stabilized sensor this one has an f 1.6 aperture letting in plenty of light and it's flanked by a 120 degree 12 megapixel ultra wide at f 2.4 and a 2.5 x optical telephoto at f 2.0 a lidar scanner a mic and a flash to finish off that stovetop the thing about the iphone camera though that we sometimes forget when we get super into the technical weeds is it's designed to be as simple as possible as easy as possible to use while still achieving results that are very difficult to get any other way so when steve jobs unveiled the original iphone back in 2007 stay with me this was one of the slides he showed on stage it's a graph of ease of use versus how smart something is and of course he absolutely trashes all the competition talking about how they're not very smart or they're not very easy to use and the iphone is going to be way up in the corner just a classic extremely scientific apple chart on stage so while the rest of the competition is definitely caught up on those axes when you just look at the camera just the camera the iphone still squeezes further up into that corner than any other phone out there right now this camera app is dead simple and it has been forever everyone knows how to point and shoot tap to focus if you really need to and if you need any extra controls they're typically hidden away maybe one swipe and a tap away and when you point and shoot the software does a lot of heavy lifting thanks to smart hdr thanks to multiple exposures thanks to computational photography and thanks to a great image signal processor that makes it all happen very quickly it would be really hard to get the results that the iphone gets from any other camera system with just plain point and shoot and that is what the iphone is so good at so i give it all the credit in the world for point and shoot but what about the few times when you actually do want to get a little more custom what about the times when you do want a little bit more manual control that is when the apple way can sort of bite you because there isn't a whole lot of that in the stock iphone camera app there actually isn't a pro mode in the iphone 12 pro's camera now fortunately they have gone ahead and added pro raw which can give you a lot more flexibility in the editing process and there are some apps in the app store that can help the shooting process for you but i guess what i'm trying to say is there's a lot of really good smartphone cameras and i think if you were to do some sort of blind smartphone camera test with a bunch of different phones all in manual mode to dial in the exact perfect photo you might be surprised which one comes out on top they'd all be really good but where the iphone separates itself is delivering consistent great results with minimal effort so every year i describe iphone photos in the review and every year it's pretty similar they've got this crunchy processed look but not too over sharpened or over processed plenty of dynamic range and detail for such a small file and the iphone is notorious for flattening out pictures with faces making sure it always brightens up any faces that might be in the shadows or not exposed too well it will always sacrifice the rest of the image if it has to in favor of the subject or the face which most would argue is the smart thing to do in full auto but when you spend a thousand plus dollars on a smartphone there's going to be a lot of people who want to do more than just point and shoot and so that's where there's some edge cases where the iphone camera does get beat out by the competition zoom is a big one the iphone 12 pro maxes out at 12 times digital zoom there's a few phones out right now with 10 times optical zoom lenses that max out in the triple digits for digital zoom so you know then there's other winners with even wider ultra wides or winners with laser autofocus but again as far as point and shoot goes which is what most people want out of most of their photos most of the time the iphone nails that now videos this is where to me the iphone separates itself as the best overall camera system in a smartphone because there's another layer to this which is app support so you've probably seen by now some of the memes about how a video from an android phone will look like a blurry pixelated mess on instagram while the one from the iphone looks great and there's a hint of truth behind that and there's a reason for that the truth is a video shot on a high-end android phone and the iphone 12 pro would be very similar comparable either one could win but a video shot inside of the instagram app on high-end android phone versus the iphone 12 pro will have a massive difference and that's because for years many of the most popular apps with camera functions were simply screen shotting the viewfinder in android phones instead of actually plugging directly into the camera feed like they do with iphones there was an android police article just the other day about how the galaxy s21 is the only android phone that doesn't suck at snapchat because they actually plug straight into the camera feed on this phone and that may seem like a step forward for android and maybe that's a new future direction but fundamentally it still comes down to development if i am a new app making something camera related and i can develop one version of my app for as many users as possible i'm going to make an iphone version because that's one version of the app for many millions of people and trying to make a bunch of different optimized new versions for a bunch of different android phones will just be a process of diminishing returns so it's cool to see a version once in a while for like the s21 ultra or back when the pixel had the visual core that would be cool once in a while but the iphone seems like it'll always have this development advantage at least for the near future which is actually the main reason why i carry an iphone so that being said if you want all the in-depth info on the new cameras plus the differences i found between the 12 pro and the 12 pro max with the larger sensor better stabilization and improved zoom yes i did make a video about all those things but bottom line here is it isn't much of a difference in most shots until you get to the edge cases which is where that stuff can produce less noisy photos on the max also you remember dolby vision but how there is this huge deal made about the fact that the iphone 12 series is the first set of dolby vision certified cameras and suddenly it was about to become a huge deal and everyone would start shooting hdr all the time well that hasn't really played out yet uh don't get me wrong the video files look great dolby vision hdr video from an iphone looks amazing on an iphone and if you send it to other iphones it'll look phenomenal on those displays but the second you have to export it and send it somewhere else that's where the experience starts to fall apart iphone's dolby vision video is using hlg which stands for hybrid log gamma and without getting super into the weeds on file formats and nits it's just not compatible everywhere so if i shoot adobe vision hdr video on my iphone and i want to share it somewhere like twitter instagram or even an apple tv where it's not supported well then the video gets converted and mapped to an sdr image fitting all of that hdr information back into a standard dynamic range screen and to me that sdr image doesn't look great so dolby vision hdr video looks super good when it works and i've seen some awesome examples even on youtube of iphone 12 pro hdr videos and if you have the right monitor or the right phone then these videos look awesome but i'm still waiting for the best most reliable hdr pipeline for getting a video shot here to hit your eyeballs compatibly beautifully every time but in summary overall the iphone cameras pretty good 24 7. i think it would be foolish to overlook magsafe magsafe is one of the most interesting new features on the iphone 12 series not because of anything amazing physically i mean it's just a wireless charging puck with some magnets in it that align with the back of the iphone simple but the extra layer on top is there's rumors apple's eventually going to be getting rid of the charging port as early as this year so that means we could be looking at the future of charging on all iphones and then the fun part is also brings the potential of a whole ecosystem of magnetic iphone accessories enabled through magsafe so first of all on the name i get why they called it magsafe it's beloved branding but it doesn't quite serve the same utility as the original magsafe so if you rely on this magsafe puck to charge your phone and you accidentally bump the wire the phone is absolutely coming with it it's hardly any more safe than a normal wire but that being said it works slaps on the back just like that charges at 15 watts and that's fine uh there are a number of pretty decent magsafe accessories kind of like this that are just cases that are compatible with magsafe meaning uh if you slap the charger on the back it will also magnetize and work through it this happens to be one of nomad's leather cases for the iphone 12 pro max here um but other than that i was kind of hoping there would also be a separate ecosystem of just magnetic accessories that slap onto the back of the iphone so i got this car mount from belkin which has a somewhat tacky rubber on top of metal that's supposed to hold the iphone in place without any clamps which would be super cool just with the magsafe magnet inside and this to me was going to open up this whole new world of things sticking to the back of the iphone with magnets and it's barely good sometimes it might depend on your car's suspension at this point but for me it slowly sinks down while i'm driving until it eventually falls off the magnets so it feels like this magnetic charging puck is the best magsafe accessory out still five months later although there is some stuff in the pipeline by moment that i'm hoping to get my hands on that looks pretty cool they make some big claims about also having a proprietary magnet array that's a little stronger i'll believe it when i see it but long story short i'm calling it an accessory now but it may be a necessity in the very near future because if the next iphone truly doesn't have any ports then you will have to wirelessly charge your phone every single time so i guess this magsafe puck would be the best way to do that the biggest bummer for me would really just be the charging speed so wireless charging is already pretty inefficient but there's a lot of innovation going on with companies pushing super fast wireless charging speeds 40 50 60 watt wireless charging apple not doing that at all magsafe is 15 watts period actually it's 12 watts on the iphone 12 mini and even if you plug into a faster brick it's going to limit that charge to that 15 watts long term it is true that this is better for your battery health than if you want your phone to last a number of years then that's what you're getting here but sometimes you just want to charge it fast you know i guess that's why they're calling it magsafe because for your battery it is safe [Music] the iphone 12 pro has a 3 687 milliamp hour battery on paper that's actually pretty small we're very used to flagship smartphones nowadays having anywhere from four thousand to five thousand milliamp hours sometimes more rarely less but thanks to the iphone's efficiency their vertical integration their optimization all the classic stuff we've talked about for years that number doesn't really mean nearly as much as the actual day-to-day performance which is great on the iphone 12 pro i can consistently get six to seven hours of screen on time which is really good for a phone of this size on heavier days though with a lot more navigation or just more taxing use maybe i'm pulling a lot of data or playing games or using the camera a lot then it'll drop faster the a14 bionic chip inside is very powerful so it can move through battery quickly enough to kill it in a day with less than five hours of screen on time but for me anyway that's a pretty uncommon day so the only thing you really start to think about more and more after the phone comes out is longer term battery health and to be honest five months later still is a pretty short amount of time in the relative grand scheme of things as far as batteries go but you want this thing to last three four maybe even five plus years and iphones have a good history here and this iphone 12 pro that i've been using still shows 100 battery health and that's just kind of it for battery apple's kind of a bit boring in the battery department i was just talking about in the magsafe section but apple has never led the industry in charging speed they have never led the industry in battery size and there are android phones left and right doing split battery cells across foldable form factors even doing split battery cells to do faster charging in parallel there are phones doing 50 60 even 100 or 120 watts which is absolutely unreal and can get you from dead to full sometimes in half an hour the iphone has never done any of that it's just a simple modest sized cell that lasts a reasonable amount of time the iphone isn't just a piece of hardware it's the software that runs on it and it's the ecosystem that surrounds it now there isn't really a whole lot of extra stuff to say about ios on the iphone 12 pro specifically that's new here in fact that's actually one of the things people like the most about it is it is incredibly consistent they don't change too much year over year they never have and older iphones will have literally the exact same software experience as the new iphone as soon as the new iphones come out so all i really have to say about ios this time around is the stuff that was supposed to be new widgets so widgets finally came to ios after having them on android for the past 12 years or so so when apple comes late to the party on something usually there's some reason they're gonna do it the apple way or they're going to do it better even though they weren't first and now that i've had them for about five months on the iphone 12 pro they're actually kind of better and worse at the same time so ios 14's widgets are really good i actually think their implementation in ios while it's a little less custom does feel a little more polished and controlled as you'd expect from ios but when i first went over all of ios 14's new features in that video we saw a few widgets apple built in that demonstrated huge potential there's widgets smart stacks and some really informative widgets to give you live updating information they were all fairly clean and consistent visually you still can't quite put it exactly where you want on every home screen but this felt like the ios way and so now it was up to all our favorite apps and developers to update their apps to make great widgets like they did on android so where they ended up worse is there's actually not as many and they're still not quite as customizable as they are on android now maybe it's a bit unfair to expect all my favorite apps to have updated with widget support like they've had a decade to do on android but just in the apps i use five months later there's a waze widget on android but not on ios there's a soundcloud widget on android really useful playback controls not on ios there's an asana widget on android but not on ios so there are less widgets and overall less customization within the widgets themselves but overall the quality of the widgets feels a bit better so sounds about right for apple that being said i was really curious how many people really use widgets and so i did a poll on twitter asking you guys you know how many of you guys use widgets on your home screen how many don't and it turns out about 75 percent of you do whether you're on android or on ios which i found very interesting so then we've got the new app library all the way to the right now this isn't quite the app drawer that so many of us love on android but it's getting there and it's definitely useful for finding everything in one place and not needing to have every single app on a home screen or in some folders so the iphone's home screen situation will continue developing over time and speaking of developing over time so will the ecosystem you can't talk about the iphone without at least touching on the ecosystem around it so apple's ecosystem gets a little more complete surrounding the iphone every year just this year they added the homepod mini they added airpods max and the long rumored air tags are probably coming soon and in the walled garden analogy that can either be the inside of that garden getting even more lush and beautiful or it can be the walls of the garden getting a little bit higher either way i think they're kind of both true the point is it's making it harder to leave i really don't have any fundamental problem with the way ios works it's mature enough now that at this point any change they make is a small little added feature or a little experiment you know widgets were easily the biggest new thing but they've pretty much locked in stuff like their swipe up gesture and the timing and responsiveness of animations even if it is a little jarring coming from a square edge instead of a rounded edge and they've locked up the camera ui fundamentals for so long pretty much everyone on earth knows how they work by now i don't like the power button for example how it doesn't just turn off the phone it also triggers siri with a long press remember when power buttons just turned phones on and off but the most consistently frustrating thing in ios to me that i wish they would evolve is not notifications although that could also use some work too but settings just the fact that there are so many settings separated from the app and moved into the settings app it's just been annoying for a long time but guess what the iphone is still a ridiculously popular phone for a reason it doesn't change too much year over year there's nothing too dramatic happening versus the last one people understand it they're used to it both my parents use an iphone at this point and it would be really hard to recommend they switch to another phone even if that phone is technically better the cost of switching is high and that's on purpose [Music] okay so the arrival of 5g on the iphone finally 5g has been a topic we've hyped up and talked about for a long time and there were a lot of big promises made when 5g finally arrived on the iphone they opened their whole keynote with verizon ceo on stage talking about 5g for a while so it had a lot of promise to it most notably 5g just got real well we have the benefit of hindsight now were they right did 5g just get real by adding it to the 12 series no i mean mostly no 5g rolling out to the world is an infrastructure thing it is going to be a slow literal building process for that to happen so that won't suddenly happen quickly because of any one individual phone that being said yes there are now many millions more 5g customers out in the world because of this new iphone but here's a more interesting question do you even want or need 5g in the first place because here's the thing we've seen tons of promises of this wild awesome 5g enabled future with robo taxis and remote robot surgeries and insanely fast internet speeds everywhere you go but as you saw in my 5g explained video we're not there yet i mean realistically 5g speeds are not actually that much dramatically better than 4g speeds sometimes they're a little better sometimes they're actually worse the rare exception to that is when you're in a stone's throw range of a millimeter wave tower in which case you might get incredible speeds until you walk away i actually demonstrated pretty clearly in my video that if you're within eyesight of that millimeter wave tower you get fantastic speeds but as soon as there's an obstacle between you and the tower or if you literally even go behind a window or turn your back to the tower then you're gonna lose some of that signal so 5g is cool 5g has a lot of promise for the future but it is not going to suddenly get real because of one phone or any one technology the one thing you can say about the iphone which is why they're using these terms is there are now millions of people out there who are walking around with their first 5g phone some of these people will live in an area with 5g coverage and will benefit right away some of these people will live in an area that doesn't have it but that's about to get 5g coverage in the next few years and they'll see that benefits soon and some of these people will live in an area with no 5g and they won't benefit at all those people can just turn 5g off and use the iphone just like their last one also one of the fun facts is if you didn't upgrade to a 5g phone the millions of people who just left the 4g network with their 5g iphones may actually make your 4g speeds a little bit better to apple's credit they've managed to minimize 5g's effect on battery life pretty well some early 5g phones and this happened with 4g 2 had worse battery life because of how inefficient it is to constantly hunt for a 5g signal and you might have even seen that now deleted tweet of verizon account asking people to turn off 5g to improve their battery life but i actually found that the iphone does a really good job with power management it's well known now that it doesn't actually connect to 5g all the time it really just switches it on when you're downloading something or using a lot of data when you really need it if you're not it might show you the 5g logo but it won't actually be connected to 5g and it'll save you some battery and honestly you'll probably never notice so the effect on battery life has been minimal and a step has been taken forward towards getting the world's internet users onto 5g but it definitely didn't suddenly get real [Music] okay so you know how every year as soon as a new iphone comes out there is a rapid and dramatic search for literally anything that could be possibly wrong with this new phone and if there is anything then that becomes a headline and we're all just trying to find the latest the newest gate signal strength drops when i hold the phone in a vice grip antenna gate some iphones have charging problems charge gate maybe the iphone can be bent in half that's bend gate i did an entire video called iphone gates explained you can watch that but this year it's been pretty quiet right there's not that much controversial stuff about this iphone but i don't know it just doesn't feel right i feel like there's always got to be something there's got to be something for the youtube channels to feast on for views there's got to be some sort of gate that we can talk about right what is the gate oh maybe maybe it's the display again right there's always some sort of element of controversy with the screen and this screen is nice but it is a thousand dollar phone with a comically big notch and it's somehow still 60 hertz and apple's getting away with it so surely that's worth the gate maybe there's also been some occasional bubbling up of uh oled tint issues so i've seen a couple forums and youtube videos talk about green tint on the iphone's display hasn't really been enough of that happening for apple to respond to it yet but it's kind of out there or oh actually maybe it's just the fact that it still uses lightning actually no what's the iphone it uses lightning every year i mean we knew they were never going to go to usbc for the iphone that's not really a gate actually you know what i think i know what it is i think the bar for a gate is something that gets a response from apple it's got it's got to crush that threshold like you have to find something that's so major that apple's engineers didn't find and their testers didn't find but it's such a big admission that apple has to go then respond to you that would be a gate and maybe the only thing that qualifies for that would be so there is no charger in the box of the iphone 12 series and so this it was pretty significant of course it didn't get a reaction from apple but it was so big that it needed a sort of pre-reaction which was an explanation by apple in their keynote about why they were doing it so we saw them take the environmental angle you know less charges in the box means less e-waste when people would throw them away less wasted space with packaging and more iphones shipped per truck per train per plane per pallet efficiency saving the world now when you actually break this down yes you are saving some e-waste by not shipping charging bricks that people could potentially throw away if they don't need them but on the other hand the cable that ships with the iphone is a usbc to lightning cable and most people who own iphones don't have a usbc charger so they have to buy that usbc charging brick anyway which is more packaging and more money and now they're throwing away their old bricks and it's kind of not really making any difference so as much as we all hate this and we can kind of see through the environmental angle we can also sort of see how this is already starting to become normal so since this iphone shipped in a small box with no charger the xiaomi mi 11 has also shipped in a small charger-less box but they'll still give you a charger if you ask for it and then the galaxy s21 series did the same but they're not trying to give you a free charger at all when apple does something the rest of the industry takes notice they're all watching and they often react and so just like we saw with the headphone jack where there felt like there's about a one year buffer time where you could make fun of what apple was doing with the headphone jack before you delete all your ads making fun of them and copied them in your next phone i feel like the buffer time is even shorter with this one but the difference in the danger with this trend is all the innovation we've been seeing over the past few years in battery tech and charging tech and this like race to the fastest charging phone does that just end i really hope not so that's what really makes this a gate to me at least is it's not just the okay apple's not shipping a charger with the phone anymore and oh look how greedy this seems like they're being but the ripple effect that this inevitably has on the rest of the industry and at the end of the day i think that's what makes the iphone such a fascinating product to begin with is it you know it started off by changing the world in 2007 but every time they update it after that it has these second and third order effects on the rest of the smartphone world around it that's what's so crazy about the iphone there are companies that make entire phones based on rumors of what apple might do in a future iphone just so they can beat apple to the punch that is wild [Music] all right that's i think that's it i think that's everything that i've wanted to say about the iphone that i haven't in some way in some video somewhere i'm glad we did this this is uh if you made it straight through to the end of this video watch the whole thing well we've been through a lot together so i appreciate you also you might notice it's a different shirt this time that's what happens when it's a long video it takes more than one day to shoot but if you skipped directly to the end this conclusion here well you missed the most exciting part but either way yeah i'm super curious what you guys think to me it's it's not just about making a longer video just to make a long video it's about being able to cover all of a topic instead of just a narrow slice of it like we normally are compelled to but hey if you guys watch the video and you enjoyed it we can do more of this type of stuff so let me know in the comment section below also down below right below like button are all the references and all the links of all the stuff i talked about during this video as promised cool that's it thanks for watching now a word from the only sponsor brave enough to tack at the end of this gigantic video expressvpn shout out to the sponsor of this video expressvpn so quick question how did you choose which internet provider that you use actually i'll probably just answer that for you you likely didn't have a choice or if you did you're pretty lucky because in most areas you don't have a choice and so because these isps essentially have a monopoly over the areas that they serve if they start doing things you disagree with or if they start to track all the websites you visit even when you're in incognito mode what are you going to do switch you can't so using expressvpn stops this by rerouting your connection through a secure encrypted server so your isps can't see a thing and also rerouting your connection through a different server can actually be kind of fun for example if i want to watch modern family it's not on us netflix no problem i just connect to a server that's in the uk refresh and i can watch it and it's not just modern family you can get thousands of other shows on netflix basically unlocked just by switching your location when you use expressvpn so if you don't want your isp to have complete control and knowledge over every website you visit and you want to unlock more shows it's kind of a no-brainer you can grab expressvpn today and if you use my code or go to expressvpn.com mkbhd that'll get you three extra months free thanks again to expressvpn for sponsoring this video ♪ Alan Dye: The watch face
is the most powerful and personal aspect
of Apple Watch. Our approach to face design
begins with a deep respect for the history of timekeeping. We combine that sense of craft with the powerful technologies
and capabilities of Apple Watch to create these new faces. The GMT face shows
multiple time zones at once and takes into account
where you are. The Count Up face lets you
start tracking elapsed time from any given point. And inspired by classic
racing watches, the Chronograph Pro face
features multiple time scales, including a tachymeter
to measure speed based on time traveled
over a set distance. In the Typograph face,
numerals can be displayed in three custom typestyles
and four different scripts. Every combination is tailored
to fit the face perfectly. We also collaborated with
the artist Geoff McFetridge to create a unique piece of art
for your watch. There are millions
of combinations, and a different one animates
when you raise your wrist. The Memoji face
brings your favorite Memoji to your watch. Each one moves and reacts
to your touch. And with the Stripes face, you can show your pride
in who you are, support your favorite team, or even match
what you're wearing. We're so proud to add to
the legacy of Apple Watch faces with this new collection. ♪ The WWDC21 event just finished, where Apple
 announced their new softwares. Let me summarize the event for you. But let me remind you to subscribe to the channel and enable
 the notification bell to get the latest tech news. They started the event speaking about iOS 15 
and the features coming to iPhones. FaceTime video calls have been updated to support spatial audio. You'll feel like the person you're speaking with is in the
 room with you to add more realism to the calls. The mics have been updated to isolate unwanted 
audio around you using AI. The AI removes unwanted audio around you. FaceTime now supports Portrait video calls. You can also enable grid view to show all the participants. You can also share links to your FaceTime video calls 
with other users even on Android and other devices. You can also share music albums and listen to them together. You can also watch videos together. The time will be synced so that you can watch
 these videos at the same time. You cal share activities with other apps, just like the 
photo your'e seeing on the screen now. You can share your screen with others on different apps. Apple made this available for all app developers. In the iMessage app, the way photos are shown has 
been updated. You can easily navigate and see them. Sharing has become easier for links, and they'll
 show in Apple apps. You can then continue your conversation and add comments to it. Apple called this feature Shared With You. The idea is that sometimes, people share links with
 us that we don't have time to read or watch. This includes vides, photos and articles. Through this feature, you can check what's been
 shared with you and follow up with it. Notifications have also been updated. There's a Notification summary now that's done using AI. AI will prioritize your notifications depending 
on how important they are. Don't Disturb feature has also been updated. Users will be shown your status to know that 
you're not available or busy. But you can add exception like certain people and apps. They also announced Live Text feature. This feature will recognize texts in photos even on a far way billboard. This will be helpful for users. You can also add your official documents like ID, home
 keys, car keys and hotel keys to the Wallet app. These data can be added to the Wallet app. This Wallet app contains your bank cards and other
 payment methods like STC Pay. They also added direct support to the Watch with new
 design and approach. It uses AR. But it needs to be supported in more cities and countries. Apple expanded the list of countries, but until now, 
there's no any country in the Middle East. New features have also been added to the headphones
 to support people with special needs. The mics now can pick up sound in a better way 
to enhance conversations. You can now find headphones just like you can find AirTags. Spatial audio is now supported on Apple TV and M1 Mac devices. Apple Music now also supports Dolby Atmos There was an argument about this topic a week ago. Let me now discuss iPads. iPadOS has been updated, too. You can now add widgets to the Home Screen of the iPad. App Library has also been added to the Home Screen. These new updates were brought from iPhones. Multitasking is now enhanced and splitting screen is easier. You can also swap from the corner to open apps quicker. The Notes app has been updated to support Mentions and Hashtags. Blogging is also enhanced, where you can pull the 
app from anywhere to start writing a note. You can hide the app right after finishing writing a note. Dealing with links is easier now. This is also supported on third party apps. Let me now discuss Privacy, where Apple talked a 
lot about in this event. Each new feature mentioned in the event was linked to privacy. Now you can stop emails from knowing your location using IP addresses. You can hide the location among other data. There's a new feature called App Privacy Report. This feature will let you know the details of which 
apps have collected data from you. You'll be able to know where these data went. Apple 
is fighting everyone when it comes to privacy. They announced that Siri requests will be processed on the device. Siri won't use the cloud to process your requests. Speaking of the cloud, let me now discuss iCloud. If you lose your account, you can now restore it 
using the help of a trusted contact. This trusted contact will be able to offer you a
 code to restore your account with. You can also grant someone your data after you pass away. These are additional features. Let me discuss the event. They also announced iCloud+ with the same price. But this time with more privacy. No one will be able 
to know your online activities, even Apple. With this feature you can also upload your security 
camera footages with end to end encryption. This means that you can upload no matter how much of
 data, and it'll be connected to the Apple ecosystem. Let me now discuss Apple Watch. WatchOS 8 offers a new enhanced Breathing app. There's also a new feature called Reflect. This feature will give you suggestions on how to enhance 
your mental health using data that it knows about you. When it comes exercises, new ones were added. Let me now discuss the new Monterey OS for Macs. All the previously mentioned data are supported on this OS. Using the mouse of the Mac devices, you can control 
MacBooks, iMacs and iPads at the same time. You won't need Magic Keyboard for the iPad anymore. You can easily move files between these devices. The presentation they made using the mouse to 
move between all screens was really beautiful. Let me now discuss the Shortcuts app for Macs. It is one of the apps they didn't receive the attention it deserves. Hopefully, I'll make a video about it to explain it for you. The Safari app has been redesigned to become more fluid and clear. Tim Cook himself talked about this app. Sync between all devices with the same account is very quick too. Apple also focused on app developers. They offer new APIs, new Swift app and better facilitation's for developers. One of which is AR. They focused on the Swift app. They mentioned that out of the 1000 
famous apps on their Store, most of them were built using Swift. They also focused on how apps are enhanced on their platforms such as iOS, iPadOS and macOS. They also introduced a new Xcode Cloud app. Everything is available on the cloud, and the whole team 
can add and develop it on different devices. This will be very helpful for developers. Instead of gathering all developers in one place, Apple made
 the Xcode Cloud instead to let others works from afar. This app is designed to work greatly with different apps. They also talked about the billions of dollars they've
 managed to grant to developers. This has been the summary of the Apple event. They didn't announce new devices. But it is expected that
 they'll announce new devices in the upcoming weeks. Where's the iMac Pro, MacBook Pro with the new CPU? Where are the new headphones? What is this? Hopefully, they'll announce new devices soon. This is the end of this video. Hopefully you like it. Glory and praise be to Allah. I witness there is no God but
 Allah.  I ask Allah for forgiveness and I repent to Him. See you later. [Music] welcome back youtube we have and again from in-depth tech reviews and here is another comparison between siri on ios 15 beta and google assistant on android 12 beta 1. i did the same comparison same time last year between siri on ios 14 and google assistant on android 11 and both were in beta back then you should also expect another comparison between them later this year with the final release of both operating systems so without further ado let's jump in first things first on the left i have my pixel 4a running android 12 beta 1 and the iphone 12 pro max running ios 15 on the right now let's take a look at the release notes of ios 15 to see what are the improvements apple did siri got 12 new improvements seven out of which i will be able to compare against google assistant in this video and the first one is the offline support as per apple siri can now process many requests offline including timers and alarms phone messaging sharing app launch control audio playback and settings so let's turn off the wi-fi and cellular data connection on both phones and keep the sim card active to be able to send messages and make calls and now let's begin open photos open calendar set a timer for 5 minutes set the alarm at 5 am turn off bluetooth call my other number send the text message to my other number hi how are you today open photos which app would you like to use photos photos mobile or google photos photos open calendar [Music] set a timer for five minutes five minutes counting down set the alarm at five am i set your alarm for five am tomorrow turn off bluetooth okay bluetooth is now off call my other number calling my other number mobile send the text message to my other number what do you want to say hi how are you today ready to send it yes now let's try the offline audio playback control and here i have some downloaded songs in youtube music and the apple music on both phones next song previous song stop so in the offline support category siri is certainly capable of taking commands in five different areas as claimed in the release notes which is not something new to google assistant but a welcome addition to siri the second improvement to compare is the speed it says here siri is incredibly fast because of the on device processing but i'm using a pixel 4a for google assistant which is a budget phone and the 12 pro max has a very powerful cpu to minimize the gap between the two i have all the apps that i will use in this comparison running in the background on both devices then i will try 14 back to back commands on both to see which one will finish them faster so let's begin open facebook open an instagram set the alarm at 8am remind me to call my friend tomorrow morning add milk and the cheese to my shopping list take a note this is a test turn off all lights turn on bluetooth increase the display brightness by five percent show me georgia photos convert one hundred dollars to aed convert 179 centimeters to inches show me the weather play music google assistant took 1 minute and 6 seconds it did the 14 commands correctly and the best part is i didn't need to touch the phone even once but siri will require me to either use the magic word or touch the onscreen button so let's see what's going to happen open facebook open an instagram set the alarm at 8 8am remind me to call my friend tomorrow morning add milk and the cheese to my shopping list take a note what you wanted to say this is a test in this command when i said this is a test siri thought that i'm checking on her and instead of dictating my note and replied back everything checks out which is incorrect turn off all lights turn on bluetooth increase the brightness by five percent uh-oh something's wrong show me georgia photos convert 100 to aed convert 179 centimeters to inches show me the weather play music siri took one minute and eight seconds with two errors but it's definitely faster than before the only problem is i have to press a button or say the magic word which didn't slow it down but google assistant is far ahead because it took two seconds less zero errors and the pixel 4a has a cpu that's a three times less powerful than the 12 pro max so now it's time for today's sponsor market by wondershare wondershare market is an online platform for ux ui web designers product managers marketing specialists and testers [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] it is one of the great softwares has been invented to create great prototypes and ui designs with ease [Music] what's more it also provides windows mac and ubuntu versions the tool lets you create prototypes in less than 10 minutes thanks to the 500 plus libraries of icons components screens and templates and personally i like the fact that it's based on the cloud and has support for features like team members feedback sharing and more thus along with the prototypes mocked has also added support for designs and flow charts with mind mapping support coming soon wondershare market is available to try for free right now so go ahead and check it out from the link in the description below the third comparison will include two improvements the sharing and refer to contacts under sharing it says siri can now share items on screen like photos webpages content from apple music apple podcasts maps locations and more all you need to do is just saying send this to and then the contact name it will either send the item as a link or a screenshot depending on the content you are sharing and the referred to contacts improvement will allow siri to send the messages to or call certain contacts if you have the contact or the conversation showing on the screen so let's see how siri will handle this send this to my other number send this to my other number send this to my other number send this to my other number call this number reply i'm on my way send this to my other number both did six commands exactly the same but when i asked google assistant to share the location showing on the screen it shared the screenshot instead of the actual location link while siri did exactly the opposite which is certainly better so i will give an extra point to siri in this comparison the next improvement to talk about is maintaining context apple says an ios 15 series is better in understanding the context when you ask follow-up questions which is one of the areas that google assistant do really well so let's see if siri can do the same or not is global village still open there are a few locations here are their business hours for today the first one how long does it take to get there by car the trip to global village is 19 minutes is global village still open one option i found is global village on sheikh mohammed bin zayed road is that the one you want yes global village on sheikh mohammed bin zayed road is not open now how long does it take to get there sorry we don't seem to be navigating anywhere if you'd like directions just say get directions too wherever show me the actors of the conjuring 3 movie fera farmiga patrick wilson sterling gerunds who's the director the conjuring the devil made me do it was directed by michael chaves show me the actors of the conjuring 3 movie ok i found this on the web for show me the actors of the conjuring 3 movie check it out who's the director here's what i found how far is it from dubai to abu dhabi it's 146 kilometers to get to abu dhabi from dubai local movers by car what about ajman 223c street is 51.2 kilometers away from ajman how far is it from dubai to abu dhabi abu dhabi is about 92 miles from dubai by car what about taj man show me london photos the ones with buses show me london photos the ones with buses show me london photos with buses i couldn't find any matches in your photos library here are some images from the web how tall is the great pyramid of giza the great pyramid of giza is 139 meters tall where is it located the great pyramid of giza is at al haram naslid el salman al giza desert giza governorate egypt how tall is the great pyramid of the giza pyramid of giza is 481 feet tall where is it located i'm sorry i don't have any places to show in maintaining context siri was really bad it only answered one follow-up question so apple has some work to do here the next improvement is announce notifications siri can now read your notifications if your iphone is connected to airpods 2nd gen or later this is one of the things that i've been able to do on my pixel buds for a while and siri is doing it equally good so here is a quick sample from both hi how are you from gmail mod hussy test email get outlook for android it's 6 59 pm message from my other number and notifications from gmail my says how are you gmail in-depth tech reviews test email last but not least control smart home devices at a specific time for example you can ask siri to turn off your lights at 7 pm but i found this feature to only work if you have a home pod or apple tv connected to your network and here's what happens if you don't have any turn off office lights at 6 30 a.m sorry i can't schedule that without a home hub set up google assistant can also do the same so i disconnected my chromecast and the google home mini to see if it's going to work or not turn off office lights in 5 minutes all right i'll turn off wall lamp the desk clamp and the ladder lamps at 7 26 pm and yes it works so the win goes to google assistant so these are the improvements apple made to siri and how they are compared to google assistant to be honest the improvements are underwhelming and siri still lacks behind but i'm gonna wait for the final release of ios 15 to see if things will change so that's pretty much it for today that was my comparison between siri on ios 15 and google assistant on android 12. i hope you like my video and if you do please hit the thumbs up and subscribe for more videos thank you for watching ♪ Music playing ♪

the a12 bionic the new apple tv 4k can now play hdr and high frame rate we've enhanced airplay to support high frame rate hdr with our new color balance feature apple tv will work with your iphone and its advanced sensors to improve your tv's picture quality your iphone uses its camera and proximity sensor to guide you to an on-screen target color measurements start automatically apple tv uses the light sensor in your iphone to compare your tv's color balance to the industry standard specifications used by cinematographers worldwide so you'll now see much more accurate color without you ever having to adjust your tv of course the way you interact with apple tv is with the siri remote so this year we completely redesigned it with new functionality and controls it starts with a new one-piece aluminum design that fits perfectly in your hand we also have a brand new click pad with five-way navigation for better accuracy and the entire click pad is touch enabled preserving the fast directional swipes users love and we did something pretty cool with the outer ring we've given it a new circular gesture that turns it into a jaw control it now has a power button that controls your tv's power and another for mute and we've moved the siri button to the side it'll be available for 179 dollars with 32 gigabytes or 199 with double the storage capacity you can order them on april 30th and they'll be available in the second half of may m1 has been a gigantic leap forward for the mac we're thrilled to introduce a mac that has been built from the ground up around m1 the all-new completely redesigned imac is more personal more powerful and more capable than ever with a spectrum of vibrant colors with a single sheet of glass covering the entire surface now with the system on a chip architecture of m1 the bulky thermal system is replaced by just two small fans this keeps the system cool while running exceptionally quiet the result is a design that's much more compact and just 11.5 millimeters thin so on the new imac we made the display an expansive 24 inches and it has nearly 11.3 million pixels and it's four and a half k retina display plus 500 nits of brightness every image is brilliant and vivid it also has true tone which automatically adjusts the color temperature as your environment changes and it has a coating with industry-leading low reflectivity for greater comfort and readability imac now has a 1080p facetime hd camera and to complement the camera we gave imac a studio quality 3 microwave to create big room-filling sound speakers need to displace a lot of air the result is a six-speaker system that produces a massive sound stage with strong articulate bass and crystal clear mids and highs all of these speaker innovations coupled with advanced algorithms enable imac to support spatial audio when playing video with dolby atmos it has up to four usb-c ports including two thunderbolt ports for super fast data transfer and support for up to a 6k display like the pro display xdr and we created a new power connector that attaches magnetically so it's quick and easy to connect it has a two meter color matched woven cable that leads to a small power adapter which can be placed on the floor behind your desk and for ethernet check out this cool innovation it connects to the adapter and runs through the power cable to keep your desktop less cluttered you can choose from three types of keyboards with gorgeous aluminum enclosures color matched to imac first there's a magic keyboard with new emoji spotlight dictation and do not disturb keys and a lock key to instantly lock imac next there's a magic keyboard with an exciting new feature touch id which comes to the mac desktop for the first time and touch id also works with fast user switching so you can change to a different user profile with just the touch of a finger and there's a magic keyboard with touch id and a numeric keypad too magic mouse loved by imac users now features color matched aluminum and magic trackpad still by far the industry's best has a refined shape to match the new keyboard when it comes to cpu performance in apps like xcode lightroom and imovie imac is up to 85 faster and when it comes to gpu performance for certain apps like affinity photo and photoshop imac is up to two times faster than the previous models and it's even up to 50 faster than the most powerful discrete graphics in the fastest 21.5 inch imac it starts at just 12.99 in four colors and at 14.99 imac comes in seven colors with these additional features you can order the new imac starting april 30th and it will be available in the second half of may you are going to love the combination of m1 and mac os on the new imac the m1 chip is not just in the mac it's now in ipad pro the next level performance that m1 unlocks on ipad pro starts with its powerful cpu built around the world's fastest cpu core in low power silicon the 8 core design of m1 delivers a whopping 50 percent jump over the industry-leading performance of the previous ipad pro the 8 core gpu is in a class of its own delivering up to 40 percent faster graphics performance this raw performance along with the pro motion display four speakers and now support for the latest playstation or xbox game controllers with haptics makes playing games on ipad pro insanely fun but it's bigger than that because powerful custom technologies like our latest 16 core apple neural engine advanced image signal processor and unified high bandwidth memory architecture make ipad pro more capable than ever and the industry leading power efficiency of m1 enables all of that amazing performance along with all day battery life in the incredibly thin and light design of ipad pro and for our most demanding users a new two terabyte configuration gives you enormous storage capacity the usb c port already supports super fast data transfers and now we're adding thunderbolt with usb4 support as well we've added 5g to ipad pro in the us ipad pro also supports millimeter wave the high frequency version of 5g and with this model ipad pro can reach up to four gigabits per second peak download speeds in ideal conditions customers love taking stunning photos and videos on their ipad and with the more powerful isp and m1 we get smart hdr3 where the isp and the neural engine work together to adjust color contrast and noise in distinct parts of a photo and in low light conditions the isp and lidar scanner quickly and accurately focus images and videos so in the new ipad pro we're going to take a huge step forward by updating the truedepth camera system to include an all new ultra white camera designed specifically for ipad it features a new 12 megapixel sensor with a 122 degree field of view which enables something really cool and we call it center stage center stage uses the new ultra wide camera and machine learning to recognize and keep you in the center of the view what's amazing is as you move around it automatically pans to keep you in the shop and that's not all when others join in it recognizes them too and zooms out to fit everyone into the view we're bringing the stunning front of screen performance of our pro display xdr to our 12.9 inch ipad pro this is the new liquid retina xtr display and it delivers a thousand nits of full screen brightness a breathtaking 1600 nits of peak brightness and a phenomenal 1 million to 1 contrast ratio just like pro display xtr the 11 inch ipad pro still starts at just 7.99 and the 12.9 inch model adds the stunning liquid retina xdr display for just 10.99 an incredible value for such an incredible device you can order ipad pro starting april 30th and it'll be available in the second half of may at apple we continue to be committed to making an impact in people's lives and we can't wait to get these new products into your hands and see all of the amazing things you'll do with them thank you for being with us today we look forward to seeing you again soon have a great day (electronic beep) - [Morgan] Welcome. - God? - [Morgan] No, it's Morgan, fool. - Is that the only voice you got? - [Morgan] Alexa got Samuel,
Waze got Kevin and Shaq. But for five installments of $58.15, I can do a mean Larry David. Which might I say is pretty, pretty, pretty good. Or, for no extra charge,
I can do Liam Neeson. (intense music)
Press the digital crown to continue, or I will
you, and I will kill you. - Nah, I'm good. - [Morgan] Son, what exactly is it that you think you're doing? - Wiring up, I gotta get the lossless. - [Morgan] I swear, every tech reviewer out here buying $550 wireless headphones with a gyroscope accelerometer two H1 chips, nine microphones, and the first thing you fools wanna do is pass the auxiliary. At least try them out
like Tim Apple intended. Wireless. It's some crazy stuff, right? I mean, you can't walk on
water, but spatial audio, baby. ♪ I'm laid back but I don't front ♪ ♪ Dopamine up and the MagSafe plugged ♪ ♪ Hit my line like you didn't just dub ♪ ♪ Pressing decline is a sugar rush ♪ - Yo, Jonathan here. Today I'm breaking down the
brand new Apple Music update. Lossless, Hi-Res Lossless,
Dolby Atmos, spatial audio. What all that means,
why you'd wanna use it, and more importantly,
how to Properly use it. Now, because this is the internet, the one thing I want you to keep in mind throughout this video
before you drop a comment, is that all of these updates come with a price increase of $0. So it costs exactly the same
as it did two weeks ago, but it's so much better. Before we jump into any of
that exciting stuff, though, just in case you wanna
try it out for yourself, let's first talk about
how to enable that update. I will specifically be
referencing iOS devices, so iPad and iPhone. And with that, contrary to a couple of the comments I've seen, you don't need the iOS 15
beta to experience this. You simply need iOS 14.6. This update also comes to macOS, tvOS, so if you want a complete breakdown of which devices are supported, of which headphones are supported, which regions are supported, because it may not work in
every part of the world, I will drop that detailed
breakdown down below. Once you're up to date with iOS 14.6, you're gonna wanna head over to settings, and then to music. It should automatically show up. If it doesn't, I've seen
a couple of suggestions saying to toggle on and
off your sync library. For me, that particular
method did not work. I ended up just waiting overnight, and it showed up the next day. And as always, when in doubt, restart. Once everything's updated and good to go, it should look like this. And from there, there
are two important tabs to pay attention to, Dolby
Atmos and audio quality. So what is Dolby Atmos? There's a good chance you've seen Dolby Vision on a TV show or a movie. That is a flavor of HDR, kind
of the video side of things. Whereas Atmos, that covers audio. It's kind of a more beefed up, complex version of surround sound, but instead of a traditional
5.1 or 7.1 setup, you have sound coming
from the sides of you, and also from above, firing down. So you're almost in this
360 degree box of sound. Typically the way we consume
music is in a stereo field, left to right or right to left. That's why you see that L and
that R on your headphones, or you have a pair of speakers. Don't get me wrong, there are incredible stereo
mixes with huge space, separation, and great use of panning. Take the Beatles, for example. Especially now that lossless is here. If you get a chance to
listen to the Beatles with a good pair of headphones, what they did with a stereo
mix and panning is ridiculous. So hopping into Logic Pro. Typically you'll have the lead vocal, which sits right smack in the middle ♪ Got my circle and we ride like PS5 ♪ - Then you might have guitars that are panned left, or right, or both, creating kind of the stereo wall. ♪ You're switching sides ♪ ♪ Out of chances go head
put that car in drive ♪ ♪ In drive ♪ So you can see how you could create space, left to right, right to left. Once you see how something
is mixed in Dolby Atmos it's a completely different level. - Let's try this track here. Yeah, okay, so. (electric guitar strumming) So I'm kinda moving
that a bit in a circle. And then I can also go up. (electric guitar strumming) When you're in the speakers,
it's really pretty dramatic because you're actually
pinpointing all these things. For anybody who hasn't
actually heard an Atmos mix, it really is something. It is a big, big step up from just 5.1. And it mainly has to do
with the side speakers and the height speakers. You know, with 5.1, we
basically had in our, you know, in front of us, and then in back of us,
with shades in between. But having stuff up there and stuff directly in your side speakers, the detail in between front
to back is really something. And then being able to hear
things from anywhere above you. It can be subtle, it can be very dramatic. It's whatever you want it to be. It's just basically a big panner that you can do anything that you want. It's the Wild West. - I'll drop a link to that video, as well as the song I showcased
before that down below. But once you really get a
grasp of what the potential is, it is so exciting. With that said, though, I think Dolby Atmos and spacial audio really exposes the tracks that
were properly mixed for it because I guarantee you,
there was a ton of songs, and albums, and artists who wanted to jump on that playlist, that stream wave. And click that spatial
audio, Dolby Atmos button, and you can tell. There are some that
sound like hot garbage. Honestly, I hadn't used AirPods Max a ton up until this update. I always kind of reverted back to AirPods Pro because of the convenience. But getting Dolby Atmos with
music takes the AirPods Max to a completely different level. The entire Come Away With
Me album by Noah Jones is probably the best AirPods Max plus Dolby Atmos experience
I've come across. It is jaw dropping. Specifically Shoot the
Moon, oh my goodness. The acoustic guitars on
the left and the right, and the piano comes in, and it's just perfectly
carved out in its own space. And then the vocals come in. It is beautiful. As far as a more modern take on music, the entire Olivia Rodrigo
album sounds incredible. Like you could tell it
was mixed for Dolby Atmos. Here Comes The Sun by the Beatles is also another great example. And I think because that was recorded to such a high quality
source with tape and analog, and they did so many things
with panning in a stereo field once that was brought
into a Dolby Atmos world, it just worked so damn well. What I Got by Sublime also
translates really well. Surprisingly a good chunk
of the rock playlist, the classical, the jazz,
those all work really well. I particularly enjoyed the RME, the Tonic on the rock playlist. So what I'll do is try to
put together my playlist of what I think works best in
Dolby Atmos, in spatial audio, because you definitely have
to sift through the junk. That aside though, I think
this is the future of music. Like could you imagine
a John Mayer trio album mixed in Dolby Atmos,
and being able to hear it on AirPods Pro or AirPods Max? That would be incredible. I know a lot of people
out there are going to kind of be turned off or
not have an open mind, which I think is ultimately a bummer. I think the beauty of this update is yes, you do have the option to enable Atmos, and that's right there in the settings where you can leave it set to automatic or straight turn it off or on. But I think if you don't
truly give it a chance, you're going to miss out. The way that I try to look at tech is more through the lens of me, but like years and years ago. In story time, I lost
my dad when I was 18. But I think a lot of my passion and love for tech comes directly from him. He was always on the latest and greatest. We would always go to Hollywood Video. And specifically, there was one time that will forever stick in my mind where he walked up to the desk, and asked the guy working there, "Hey, do you guys have Blu-rays yet?" And the guy was like, "What's a Blu-ray?" He was always on top of it. So I try to think, you know,
"What would my dad think? How cool would it be to show him this?" Like, he loved the Beatles. And imagine if I could show him that in Atmos or spatial audio. So I try to keep that excitement
and not lose sight of it because so many of us in the
tech world tend to do that. Ultimately though, if
you're a purist, I get it. If you wanna enjoy that
lossless or high-res lossless with a pair of headphones and DAC, there's some beautiful,
beautiful stuff there. To make sure that is enabled Properly, we're gonna go back to settings
and then audio quality. We're gonna make sure that
lossless audio is enabled, and below that, there are three very important tabs to pay attention to. So what we have here is your audio quality over cellular, wifi, and then downloads. It's probably a good idea, especially if you don't
have a giant data plan, not to enable lossless over cellular, because those gigabytes
full fill up and fly fast. For most of us, what we're
probably gonna wanna do is select lossless or
high-res lossless over wifi, because it's not gonna count against your data plan
or space on your phone. Conversely, if you do have a
ton of storage on your phone, offline is probably the best idea. If you're at home and you wanna download those tracks over wifi. And then that way, once
you're out traveling whether you're on the road
or potentially flying, you're not tagging or
hitting your data plan because they're already on your phone. Now I don't by any means
consider myself an audiophile. I like things that sound good, but I generally don't like the mindset behind the audioPHile movement. Because usually it's like, if you're not using a DAC,
wearing wired headphones, listening to a FLAC
file, and they judge you, and I'm like, "Hey, if
I wanna use wireless just for convenience most of the time, and then wire up when I want to, that's not gonna affect you." If however, this lossless
experience opens up Pandora's box and starts
a new habit for you. Two channels I could
wholeheartedly recommend are Joshua Valour and Darko Audio. They know their stuff,
they're Pros, they get it. And more importantly, they're
down to earth cool dudes. With that said, I'm not
gonna go on a Vsauce3 type explanation of
what lossless audio is. Shoutout to Jake. But as far as what lossless
audio does for you, it's essentially allowing you to listen to that piece of music as close to the original
source as possible with nothing in the way. Really, there are two numbers
you gotta pay attention to, bit depth and then sample rates. So take a CD for example,
remember those things? That has a bit depth of 16
and a sample rate of 44.1. Spoiler alert, and this
may be a little bit of a surprise for a lot of you out there, even though Apple Music
technically supports all the way up to 24, 192, the majority of music out
there taps out at 24, 48. A lot of it will sit in
that window of 16, 44, 16, 48, 24, 44, or 24, 48. He do have some instances
where music will go higher. A lot of the Travis Scott stuff is 24, 88. The Search for Everything
by John Mayer is 24, 96. And surprisingly, a lot of the older music that must've been recorded to analog and then brought into this modern world that got remastered to 24, 96 or 24, 192. Of course, Hotel California, in all of its 12 string
glory, are in 24, 192. To my surprise, the entire
Disturbed studio collection is in 24, 192. There's even some Metallica, some Pantera, and Linkin Park in high-res lossless. So all that's cool, but how exactly do you make sure you're
listening to music in lossless? And surprise, surprise number two, the cheapest way to get into that door is Apple's $10 Lightning to 3.5mm adapter because that will get you up to 24, 48. And again, like we talked about, that's most of the music out there. Are there better DACs
and options out there? Absolutely. But for the money, it
is surprisingly good. Personally, my go-to way
to listen to lossless with Apple Music is using a
DragonFly from AudioQuest. They come in three different
flavors and price points. You have black, red, and then cobalt. Essentially, the higher
up the ladder you step, the better the converters are. But all three of these will get you up to 24, 96. My go-to headphones to
pair with the DragonFly are the Beyerdynamic DT 1990 Pros. I do have a pair of IEMs that I love, but I end up reverting
back to the Beyerdynamics like 85% of the time,
whether I'm working on music, mixing, editing a video,
or in this case, listening. Now those headphones aren't
to the moon expensive, but they're also not the most entry affordable options either. So what I'll do is post a
couple different options of over ear, on ear, in ear that are under the $300 price point to pair either with the DragonFly or that Apple lightning adapter. So what if you love Hotel California and you wanna hear it in 24, 192 glory? What do you need? The answer is a better DAC. In my case, the audio
interfaces that I use from RME, the Fireface and the Babyface, those work exceptionally. All of a sudden the M1 iPad Pro has turned into this incredible
high-rise music machine that you can dish out 24, 192. So I've set it up with higher end studio speakers, which
has been incredible. But I think what the
setup is for most people is the iPad Pro paired with the Babyface, which
has been phenomenal. Probably the best part
about this combination is the Babyface Pro is bus-powered. So one cable directly into the iPad, and you are set with a great interface to record music, to mix, to listen back, and now, to play back
high-res lossless music. I've actually used this
combination. a ton. The Babyface paired with the iPad Pro and it's been incredible. I challenged myself to record and mix an entire song using
nothing but the iPad Pro, and to level that up,
shoot a video in HDR, edit on the iPad with the XDR display, and then upload that to YouTube in HDR. So if you wanna see how that turned out I got that link up here and down below. So if you truly wanna experience 24, 192 true high-res, lossless,
that's a great way to go. I'll also drop some
other options down below. But I think the most important thing to remember here is again,
most music caps out at 24, 48. So either that lightning
adapter, or the DragonFly is going to be more than enough
for most of you out there. I will also post a playlist of some of my favorite music in lossless. so you guys can check that as well. Shoutout to MagSafe. Thank you guys so much for
watching, hopefully this helped. If you enjoyed it, and you
found it useful, drop a. We should just tell
the truth quickly.

back guys everythingapplepro here another dose of apple leaks and news including the iphone 13 a lot of recent developments and a couple exclusives there got the apple watch series seven with a new squared body gotta say it looks fantastic especially in green and we got ios 15 coming up next week and some feature leaks and rumors like to share and everything in between now for my long time fans out there i do apologize i really don't like not posting but what we're doing over at phone rebel i think long term passion wise far more important for me we're trying to build the best iphone case ever i think with gen 3 we're getting a lot closer we're going to do metal buttons you know this new styling thinner lighter grip is a big one for us and potentially colors for those of you waiting on the open series case the flex series now we're getting our prototypes within a week and i think we're going to make a summer release stay tuned for that one as always gen 2 in stock the strongest magsafe system in any case on the market phonerable.com and our gen 1 cases are cheaper than ever thanks for supporting and helping us build something big all right so let's start out with the apple watch series 7. this one's coming from prosser who's just been on a leaking spree lately it shows us a revamped apple watch chassis design now squared very reminiscent of the iphone 12 he says this is based off of actual cad data what you're seeing here is very very close to final if not the actual final design we look on the vent side here where usually we had the smaller vent holes for the mic speaker now they extend all the way down the chassis and i gotta say it looks nice very futuristic the digital crown does remain it does seem like the screen still has a 2.5 d type glass i think it would be difficult for apple to make a flat glass not to mention not very user friendly the back is still going to extend processor says that the overall screen sizes will stay the same 40 and 44 millimeters but apple has been testing a smaller bezel larger display variant unclear if it'll make it to the final release now he says that he's only seen the physical design so he doesn't really know about any new specifications new sensors what we've heard previously is a blood glucose monitoring system which probably will be delayed into next year blood pressure system and blood alcohol but that's all slated for 2022. so mostly just a physical redesign this year processor says one of the colors apple is particularly set on is the green and he says that although that may not make it to the final release apple has been experimenting with a number of different colors and lastly prosser states that this very well may be the apple watch series 8. so we're seeing a design that's slated for 2022 likely or possibly to come with micro led and speaking of that last year in august we heard that that may take three to four years to arrive that's a more concentrated form of mini led truly crazy technology they're gonna debut it in smaller displays first like smart watches then your iphone will eventually have a micro led display so this design may not release this year but it very well may be the series seven and moving on to iphone 13 leaks got a couple exclusives for you from max wine back one a color swatch of the new iphone 13 pro graphite color certainly a lot darker than the current offering he previously reported apple is going a lot darker on their space gray or graphite offering for 2021 and another exciting capability for the iphone 13 lineup regarding the camera so apple is working on a new electronic image stabilization system that works across all frame rates and resolutions internally it's called warp and he believes it has something to do with subject tracking and we know that apple is working extensively on stabilization so this certainly fits the bill on recent rumors and another report by digitimes reiterates that yes we will be seeing sensor shift stabilization across the iphone 13 lineup so every model will have their wide angle sensor sensor shift stabilized with the magnets very impressive technology debuted originally on the 12 pro max wide-angle sensor and another recent report this time by web bush analyst dan ives claims that yes one terabyte will be an option on this year's iphones except limited to the 13 pro and 13 pro max models with the higher storage requirements for prores files the pros certainly could use this feature from the same report dan ives does report that lidar will be happening across the lineup so even the 13 and 13 mini which everyone else is disagreeing with in recent cads by the way prosser has made two recent cads available the 13 and 13 mini so you can download them and take a look at them yourself those do not show a lidar sensor so it's highly unlikely the apple would put lidar on the base models actually taking a look at the 13 pro cads lidar sensor is larger than the 12 pro and 12 pro max apple's certainly investing a lot of money into this tech they're not just going to throw it on the base models especially one they're about to axe next year and a new leak details the actual milliamp battery capacities of the iphone 13 lineup and happy to report that they're all bigger shows us that the iphone 13 pro max will have an 18 larger battery the iphone 13 13 pro will have a 9 larger battery and the 13 mini and 8 larger battery so not terribly substantial but the 13 pro max with all its room inside does get the biggest battery boost of course 120 hertz it's gonna need it speaking of 120 hertz displays samsung and lg have started their production of apple's displays for the 13 to 13 pro and i can't wait to seamlessly glide across content in 120 hertz now larger batteries are great but the apple a15 will likely be another huge efficiency boost as it's working on a revised version a five nanometer digit times reports that tsmc has officially begun production on the apple a15 all systems set to go looks like we're on for the september launch of the iphone 13. your passport is going to be in your iphone very soon i remember talking about this patent a few years ago now apple once again is pushing for passports and digital ids driver licenses to be in your phone with a new digital authentication system this latest patent shows us that apple is still doggedly chasing this one and eventually everything will be digitized no surprise there and regarding next year's iphone qualcomm has shared more details on their upcoming x65 modem this one has more power efficiency and support for more millimeter wave bands and next year is going to be the last year where apple uses third-party modems 2023 we're going to start seeing in-house apple built modems and mark german of bloomberg gives us an update on airpods 3 and airpods pro 2 launch dates so airpods 3 coming this year by end of year airpods pro 2 the more ambitious design without the stem so all integrated into one little bud that's coming in 2022 apple wasn't able to make that happen in time but certainly is still working on it and also some macbook news so the upcoming 14 and 16 inch macbook pros according to webbush analyst dan ives will be arriving at wwdc next week from mark irman of bloomberg he reports that we'll be seeing a 10 core apple m chip no name there but uh it'll be accompanied with up to 64 gigabytes of ram and up to 32 gigabytes gpu course german does report that these new macbooks will have an hdmi port and magsafe of course is coming back to the macbooks a redesigned chassis more square like and in our renders it's kind of hard to convey that square bodies usually look a little fatter there's also a sketchy rumor going around that we won't be seeing a macbook pro logo on the front like the new imacs and the ipod brand may not yet be dead according to steve moser and this is a rumor nothing substantial apple may plan on releasing an ipod touch 8th generation this fall so keeping the ipod brand alive i'd like to see it and i'd like to see a polished chrome back too and some ios 15 stuff according to an extensive report by bloomberg we're going to be seeing some major changes but nothing all too game changing in ios 15. so first off on the ipad we'll be seeing the ability to use widgets throughout the home screen not limited to just the left column and you'll be able to resize them there'll be more sizes of widgets german also reports that there will be new notification preferences for different automatic replies based on new statuses such as working sleeping driving and different contexts for different replies another big one german says is imessage so apple is working on imessage's capabilities they're trying to expand it to compete more with whatsapp more of a social network rather than just a messaging client and apple recently pr a slew of new accessibility features that they'll be adding to ios 15. essentially a variety of new ways to interact with your devices with a variety of different disabilities and in that accessibility feature preview there's actually what could be a hint or glimpse of a new ui for the navigation bar in ios 15 where it just blends in with the buttons looks nice could be giving us a hint at the design direction apple is taking also recently rumored is a food tracking feature built right into the health app also from a twitter leaker a slew of ios 15 features iphone 13 features in particular the control center will be getting a redesign to look more like big sur more compact clean tiny and lastly the iphone bootloader runs doom this is in pongo os a component of check rain just another one to add to the list and there it is see you guys at wwdc with ios 15 next week peace apple just ruined the brand new m1 ipad pros for both myself and a lot of people out there and for those of you guys that watched wwdc like i did and were really disappointed there's also a couple very sneaky things that they included that makes me wonder will this ever be a laptop replacement so let's go ahead and talk about what they have changed and also what they haven't and why this ipad really doesn't make any sense for me anymore and with that why a lot of people are saying they are now going to be returning their m1 ipad pro now then when ipad pro is arguably the biggest leap in ipads ever obviously it is the best ipad ever made but the jump that we got with this new m1 chip added is just mind-blowing it completely shocked us when apple announced it in multiple ways but the biggest one is just that m1 chip that is designed for their desktops now because these tablets are so incredibly thin we for sure thought that the performance is not going to come anywhere near an m1 macbook pro and that they are going gonna thermal throttle quite a bit so we gave you guys estimates on the performance but when we actually got them in and we tested it we were just shocked by how well they performed and how little thermal throttling there was in such a thin chassis and since they're using the m1 chip of course you have eight gigs of ram at base which is crazy for a tablet already at least an ipad and up to 16 gigs at the high end and up to two terabytes of ssd that is extremely fast way faster than before and you can get all of that even on the 11 inch which comes at a base price of just 800 bucks and on top of that you factor in having a really nice sharp colorful display great quad speakers that this one sounds actually better than the macbook pros you add in an awesome front camera we have rear cameras on the back which you don't get on a macbook you can use the apple pencil as well and the base 600 nits of brightness are about one to two hundred minutes brighter than a macbook not even including the xtr display and then you grab the xdr display and the larger model right here where that screen is just so amazing when you're watching movies with deep blacks it just looks stunningly good so you take all of that you add that value then you get yourself a magic keyboard that works incredibly well although it is expensive or with that now you can get something like this bridge keyboard that just came in a 250 for this larger model 100 less than apple's option and it literally turns it into something that looks like a macbook bam look at that right there this has so many people excited about the fact that they can get one device one ipad and now have insane performance of m1 in an ipad with thunderbolt built in and they can have all those extra features and benefits of an ipad that you can't get in a macbook now is the time to ditch mac os in a macbook and just go for an all-in-one device well unfortunately that didn't happen if you guys watched our performance comparison in things like adobe rush it actually exported it slower than the older ipad pro and then all the other issues that people had with ipad os such as filezap being very limited we had issues with thunderbolt not being able to connect properly some of our drives didn't connect other ones that did connect were much lower than on a macbook pro we also found no differences at all between 8 gigabytes and 16 gigabytes of ram on the ipad pro and we did a bunch of different exporting tests productivity tests we even opened up tons of apps and there was no difference at all in fact the 16 gigabyte version closed an app earlier than the 8 gig version so that was a shocker and then we found out that the ipad os actually has a limit of 5 gigs per app so it's literally hard cut all of those issues and limitations had a lot of reviewers including us kind of just scratching our heads saying yeah this thing is insane this is a perfect laptop replacement has the performance but the software is just so limiting and we're not really getting anything new and i said that you know when was the last time your ipad pro was too slow given the things you could do on it the old 2018 version even where you say hey i need it to be faster it's all software limited and all of us were saying wait for wwc wait for apple to step up wait for us to get pro apps such as xcode and final cut maybe we're going to get new updates for the files app to make it a lot more usable like an actual mac and in reality apple didn't give it to us and i think the ipad west portion was probably one of the biggest disappointments out of the whole show now yes there are a couple legitimate cool features that are being added you guys let me know what you're most excited for down in the comments section but if i look at my notes list here the ipad os section has literally the least added new features and some of the things are just kind of like why didn't we have this before for example widgets being able to be added on wherever you want okay android's had that for such a long time that's been a part of ios before that or the app library okay i guess that's nice to have that as well but it probably should have been there before we have updates for multitasking which is great but it's not really a new feature they kind of fixed it where before it was very confusing to use and sometimes it took multiple tries now they just made it easier and more intuitive to use so it's not really a new feature and then of course we have the notes feature which i'm going to go in detail in our next video and hopefully i'm going to download the beta version but that's not really giving us anything really wanted with the m1 ipads to harness all the extra performance and capabilities that's just making it easier and better on the software to use an ipad as an ipad apple also showed off other software in this section that applies to a lot of devices not just the ipad kind of like they wanted to make this a little bit longer for the ipad and then they also showed off swift being able to compile and update straight out of that which is great but people want xcode on the ipad and it doesn't seem like apple is wanting to give it to us and the same thing with final cut pro i would love it so my whole thought with this ipad once i got it once i used it just like a lot of you guys is i don't really need a macbook anymore as soon as i get an update to ipad west we can make it be more usable with external drives make it work remove some of those limits software limitations for ipads get a software that can actually utilize this crazy hardware i will switch over i have this crazy all-in-one device that is good for everything on the go it's productive you can do entertainment play games touch screen on there excellent machine all-in-one that's all i need now but apple obviously does not want us to use this as a macbook replacement and the proof of that is when they took this thing out and they showed off the update to where you can actually switch your cursor from your mac and scroll it to an ipad that is sitting next to it and then do your ipad things on the ipad and then bring it back into your mac to do the mac things either the macbook and then you can bring your macbook next to your imac if you want a larger screen so what apple wants you to do is not replace your mac with an ipad they want you to buy this ipad which this one right here is about two grand for this package it goes even higher than that and then they want you to buy a macbook for when you need to do real things like if you want to edit with final cut you want to use xcode and other programs logic on the go and then if you want to do it at home buy another one it will allow you to put all three next to each other and just move things from one to another and that just has me thinking wow that is incredible is apple ever going to make this the kind of machine that it should be with the hardware that's inside will the software ever catch up now to me after seeing that knowing that we're not going to get another ipad os update for another year is it even worth having this device like i mentioned earlier all the things i could do with this machine i could do with the 2018 ipad pro same keyboard same capability same new ipad os with the notes feature this hardware this m1 chip isn't being fully utilized even in gaming in video exporting it's not being fully utilized right now and apple is keeping it limited with their files app and other features so what's the point of having this machine and i know a lot of people agreed we're seeing tweets people saying hey i'm returning my ipad if i have this hardware for this much money i spent but i can't really make the most of it and i still need to keep my macbook there's no point to having and personally and unfortunately my return window closed on friday so for anybody that bought this at launch and got it right away conveniently fridays when the return window closed wwc is monday and all of our hype waiting for this machine to become an actual pro machine where you can replace your macbook and you can do everything on it well all of that was just crushed and i think apple just ruined the m1 ipad pros they're still great ipads but they're not laptops they're nowhere near what they could be and we guess we're gonna have to wait even longer and based on what apple showed off i don't know if they're ever gonna want this to be a macbook replacement just by limiting the software but you guys let me know what you think did apple ruin the m1 ipad pro or is this still worth upgrading from your 2020 ipad pro 2018 is this the machine that could do everything for you is it what you wanted with this new software or were you hoping for more i want to hear you guys honest opinions now i'm going to do a video on the top features getting into that with ipad os so if you guys want to see that or other videos on wwc click that circle above and you guys can help us reach our goal of a million subscribers before the end of the year we would greatly appreciate it and this has been max and i'll see you in the next video check me out the apple engineers went to the drawing board to build a better mask apple actually designed their very own mask for their employees in store to wear they've actually got a couple different versions but this is kind of the standard this is what most employees will be wearing it's what most employees of apple will have we've got some iphone 12 later case news coming at the end of this video so stick around for that willy doo pulled it off plus some viewers of the lou later show downstairs that got in touch with him so shout out to them anonymously this in front of me is the official apple mask this is the reusable face mask in medium large for more information please visit welcomeforward.apple.com what was crazy to me is on the packaging which is all very apple esque as you can tell we have what looks like a serial number definitely an item number and a lot number and production date so just like everything else apple tremendously detailed stuff over here and an unboxing experience that looks like it's kind of beyond what you would expect for a reusable face mask even on the back designed by apple in california assembled in china you've got to get that in there on every single apple product this has to be one of the most unusual apple unboxing videos i've ever done so we pop into it and first thing we see is an is a little attachment a little adapter actually to hold the mask on at the back of the head you don't see this on your typical cheap mask i actually have some of those here as well for comparison this little piece how do i even how does that come out of there so there's two of these little guys and this is gonna go on the back side of the mask to hold it on more securely than i suppose just using your ears or do you even use your ears at all this is the packaging for the mask now each one of these boxes which an employee would receive would actually include what looks like five of these masks and they are not one time use in fact there's some some rules around how frequently these would be used for an apple employee each mask is capable of being worn five times for up to eight hours each time so it's supposed to be washed once every eight hours if you're a part-time apple employee you wouldn't have to wash it every single shift if you were a full-time apple employee you would wash it after every single shift five times would be the maximum for usage so it is disposable it's reusable and disposable it's reusable to a point and i guess that just keeps it just makes sure that the that the quality is still there that the functionality is still there without breaking down if you go ahead and wash it more than that where do i there's a little line here i see look of course apple packaging here apple claims and i read this on the original report that this they believe this is a superior mask for daily wear compared to the cheapo kind of surgical mask and it definitely i mean it looks cool that's for sure so it has what looks to be an option here i believe i could just hook this around my ears or and then i could hook this piece at the back side let's see this part folds up this part folds down oh wow all right let me try this out here and this is going to go around the ears and i guess there's a pinch point here okay so as you can tell i mean that's a different fit than what you get out of a typical surgical mask it it's much more structured in fact so i'm going to pull one of these out for comparison real quick so you can see this is just a relatively flimsy sheet whereas this one has well it has three pieces to it there's the center piece here and then there's a piece that reaches under my chin of course the beard is not ideal but it reaches under the chin and then a separate piece which comes up and extends over the nose and then you have this pinch point at the top here it feels uh it feels very secure as far as breathing is concerned i'd say it's fairly comparable to this but i definitely feel more sealed off than a standard surgical mask now of course you can also take this piece here and hook it onto the back side of this loop the strap is actually quite elastic this these ear pieces unlike these which are uh well they're elastic too but sometimes you're a little concerned about the connection point here that it could rip off i've yanked that a few of these and then this pops off this feels like it can deal with more tension if you really want to pull it tight and that's sort of what i have there now that's like it's like wearing a hat or something it feels it's not going anywhere it's on there it certainly gives you a far more secure fit on the mask so this is what every apple employee is going to be wearing it's what they're going to have so yeah i mean it does seem like an improved mask uh it's kind of cool to see a design team look at a product that's not typical for them obviously apple is more likely to be looking at phone designs and other gadgets and electronics that you may perceive as being more complex but it is interesting to see apple's take on the typical disposable although semi-reusable mask when you compare it to the standard which we see absolutely everywhere now if i go ahead and just put this unit on so now i'm getting way more air into this one compared to the apple and even if you listen to me talking it's far less muffled i think this thing is much more serious and look it even sort of maintains its structure once you've taken it off uh i can actually breathe a little bit easier in this one but it's likely because it's not making a tight seal here part of that is my beard but it's also the fit of the mask it's just nowhere near as tight as the official apple mask so have they improved it uh i would say so i say that this thing is an improvement over this however if you were to purchase this if apple was to sell this you would have to assume it would be far more expensive than this 20 bucks for like 50 of these apple would have to sell that one for more presumably if they did sell it it's a filter it's definitely a filter and it's thicker and you know people out there they they've posted tests of attempting to blow through different mask material to like blow out a lighter or a candle or something this one i mean it's just based on my initial exposure here but this one not nothing there is no there's zero air getting through that so they don't really share exactly what the capability of this filter is like in 3m terms n95 or something like that but based on my impression here this is a this is a pretty substantial filter all right so the last piece we want to take a look at over here is the clear mask which is the other option for apple employees and of course theirs wouldn't ship like this this is from the company directly supplying apple it's a totally different thing altogether apparently it's anti-fog fluid resistant improved comfort and breathability now this is a much different approach than the style that comes from over the head and wraps around which leaves a lot of gap under your chin this one aims to actually seal a little bit under the chin there that's what we're doing have i got this correct right now these things are wild that is that's futuristic looking so i could tighten this up to improve this seal around the bottom and that actually does a pretty good job of that i'm probably more partial to this style of mask uh i can you can feel the moisture inside of here but these things are important at least in the sense of no i feel like my voice is muffled quite a bit in this but the voice being muffled is not a big deal or i should say it's a trade-off because the importance of these masks is for communication and interaction with people who rely on lip reading this isn't going to help you if every employee in the store is wearing this one there's no lips available for communication for those that require it and this is going to allow for that so presumably there will be some mix of these styles of masks inside of the apple store i don't know if it's an option for each employee to choose or if some are designated to wear this style and others this style but these apparently are the two masks that are going to be popping up that you're going to see in the apple store they will be the official apple masks so what can i say is it an improved design yeah i think so i don't know how feasible it is at scale if some other company wanted to go out and attempt to bring this a similar design to this to the market to sell to people in giant boxes i don't know how feasible that is but this is uh for me this is an improvement oh i don't have glasses here but will just told me the other advantage here is that it will not fog up glasses if you're wearing glasses because of the tight seal here in the the construction i have sunglasses okay fine i guess that would work check me out i can still fog these up yeah no problem maybe i got to go tighter let's see that's what they say hold up i can go tighter fixed yep if you do the nose seal nice and tight you can stop you can stop some of the fog from coming up so anyway there it is it's the official apple mask never thought i'd see the day but it it just seems to be the way it is in 2020 and and as i mentioned the most interesting part for me is the idea of a company at the scale of apple with the design team that apple has to just see their different approach to a product that's ubiquitous we see it all the time we see it everywhere and they just they just take a look at it and say hey we think we can do something different we think we can do something better for our employees and they quickly whip something like this up i think that's pretty cool it's been a long time since you had to go here yeah all right will big news today well actually first before we get to your news i just want to cover some new developments with later case we actually have the cases for the upcoming iphone 12. they are on the site they're available for pre-order how wild is that i want to get your impression real quick on the little iphone that's going to be the 5.4 inch iphone 12. so this is it yeah that's it okay yeah i uh i've always liked the industrial design um the sharper corners flat edge yeah yeah they're all gonna have that but this one is just so tiny yeah i i uh i don't mind working with this you can get behind it yeah so as you guys can see on on these cases we have the new design showcase for the upcoming iphone 12 with the flat edge with the coverage on the camera for these we went with the cyber edition coverage near the camera and as mentioned these are available already on the later case website so you can be first in line if you're planning on picking up one of the next gen iphones get it protected with something well pretty much as slim as you can do right now on the market so that's announcement number one announcement number two has more to do with will and will i you got some explaining to do what is this right here uh well this is uh my name willie blue yeah willy blue limited edition strictly limited crazy we put this together i love this color blue it's the first time we did any color with later case in collaboration with willy do actually i should say right now a will stands to gain a portion of proceeds of every case sold goes directly to will do's bank account me okay yeah that's great that's cool don't let him down on this after all the years he's been doing this for you this is his uh you know you gotta get behind the man and you're not gonna regret it because check out this blue right here once again 100 dupont kevlar check out this blue right here can you get behind a blue like that nice it's very subtle limited edition packaging and you know what the thing is here well there's a there's a rumor that that upcoming iphone is gonna have a midnight blue color they did midnight green the last time around as a rumor iphone 12 will have a deep like a dark midnight blue you can get ahead of it right now this is in stock they can order this this ships right now willy blue color and you can get it in a number of popular devices look at this look at that you could take your current generation iphone and have the midnight blue before anybody else even has the midnight blue and then they can mix and match with the iphone that's right look at check this out man midnight blue across the thing you can see the beautiful texture over here it's a new type of texture i think people are really going to like this course portion of proceeds goes to willy do himself it is the really blue limited edition it's across all skus on the later case website but like i said not a lot of quantities so if you want to pick up i mean this is a one-time deal yeah i mean this is great you're going down in history man someone's going to put this on the shelf don't throw out the packaging it may never happen again willy blew later case check it out i do like the color it's very uh enigmatic i guess good thing kirk's still rolling right now yeah yeah yeah i know it's nice it's uh it's subtle it's not like a in your face blue if you compare it to the to the black i mean you can see it's a subtle difference but it's not like a huge commitment like some kind of sky blue or something yeah it's gonna look good over time and the weave is uh more subtle too yes it's it's it's got it's got a more dense weave and if you have black components on the phone the black kind of it mixes nicely with the dark blue yeah yeah so cool yeah i like it i really do hey so i managed to dump and modify the firmware of the newly released apple attacks effectively jailbreaking them and in this video i will show you how i did that before we start hacking the attacks though we need to look at the hardware to understand what's inside and what's hackable luckily colin o'flynn famous hardware hacker and a good friend of mine made some high resolution pictures of the pcb and allowed me to use them in this video this here is the front side of the attack and this is where all the interesting stuff is the big silver chip is the apple u1 a custom chip that is responsible for the ultra wideband functionality of the airtech so far this chip was only available on recent iphones the apple watch and the homeport but now you have it in a 30 device and so being able to experiment with it in a cheap way is really awesome the second biggest chip is this one a nordic semiconductor and a f52832 this is a microcontroller with integrated bluetooth and nfc i'm pretty familiar with it as i've seen it a lot in recent years and even published hardware attacks on it in 2019 then we also have a small 32mb spy flash and as i've shown in other videos these are in general really easy to dump now personally i wasn't really interested in the attacks at first but on friday morning i woke up and saw that someone sent me a dump of this spy flash and after taking a quick look inside i got hooked i looked through the flash contents saw that it contained the rtkid firmware for the u1 saw some nrf code and knew that i wanted to get code execution on the device and so i did what any hardware hacker would do i got an appointment at the apple store and bought a pack of airtags now what was really cool is that colin who by the way builds awesome hardware hacking tools for a living and also has a great youtube channel had already posted all the test pins and so on on twitter and so once i had my attacks i didn't really have to search for much he even found two test pins on which the debugging interface of the nf52 is exposed unfortunately it was locked down this means that you can erase and program the chip but you can't dump the firmware that is on it my goal was to change that and to try and break into the nif 52 microcontroller as it seemed like the most interesting target i assumed that it would run the bluetooth stack handle the communication with the iphone and probably also do a lot of other things but how can we unlock this processor and get debugging access now as said i'm pretty familiar with the nf52 and i also do a lot of voltage fault injection attacks and even better i knew that in 2020 the security researcher working under the name limited results published an article in which he documents how he used fault injection to re-enable the debugging features on an nrf52840 this chip is very closely related to the one found in the attack and so i assume that the same hardware attack would also work here you can find a link to his posts and also the hardware he builds and sells in the description and so at this point the approach i wanted to take was clear let's use voltage-based fault injection to hack into the device now you might be wondering what is voltage-based fault injection or as it's more commonly called glitching well simplified if you take the power supply to for example a microcontroller and you interrupt it for a very short amount of time you can manage to change the behavior of the chip and so for example you can corrupt memory reads and even skip instructions now if we imagine the boot of a chip at some point in time there might be a check that is similar to this one the chip checks whether debugging is disabled and if it is it will skip enabling the debugging hardware however if we manage to glitch during the exact time of the check we might be able to trick the chip into enabling the debugging hardware and that's exactly what i did on the airtag naturally this is not super easy but it's also not super hard the first thing we have to figure out is what do we want to glitch if you look at a microcontroller you will often see that it has a single power supply of for example 1.8 volts however in the chip often other voltages are generated using regulators and so for example the cpu core might run on a different voltage than the bluetooth peripheral and so on now when we glitch we really want to try to only glitch for example the cpu core which isn't really possible when we would try to glitch on the 1.8 volt supply however regulators tend to be noisy and to compensate that there are often external decoupling capacitors external to the chip and these capacitors can give us direct access to the voltage of for example the cpu core and so if we attach a switch to ground to that capacitor and we press down on the switch we create a short circuit to ground that will interrupt the power to the cpu core and if we open the switch again power will be back now obviously with a physical switch you won't be able to do this super precisely and so instead of a switch we can use an n channel mosfet and instead of triggering it with our fingers we can use a device now normally you would use an fpga or something else with very precise timings but i thought it would be fun to try to glitch the attack with a four dollar raspberry pi pico and so if the pico will enable the gpio the power to the cpu core will get interrupted and if the gpio goes down again the power will be restored now how does this work on the real device luckily for us the capacitor for decoupling the cpu core voltage is easily accessible on the underside of the device you don't even have to remove the pcb from the tag you just need to remove the back side and even better there's a nice test pad connected to it which makes soldering much much easier now a fair warning i was impatient when i soldered my first airtech and i immediately ripped off the test pad and had to solder directly onto the pads of the capacitor instead so be careful when you try this at home now i connected the cpu core test pad to my raspberry pi pico using an n channel mosfet then for the picot to detect when the nrf is turned on i also connected the power supply of the nrf to the pico i had to use a level shifter here as the pico runs at 3.3 volts and the nrf itself is running at 1.8 volts i also connected the battery contacts of the attack directly to my raspberry pi so that i could control when the attack is powered on all that's left to do now is to connect an swd programmer to the programming pins that were found by colin and so after each glitch we simply try to connect with the chip using swd and if it succeeds we were successful with the glitching and the nice thing is we can try this a ton of times in fact we can restart the tag glitch it and then try to connect multiple times per second and so we don't have to be super precise we can basically brute force it and wait for us to get lucky now let's look at this on the actual hardware this is the attack on which i managed to re-enable debugging and dump the firmware the first time this is after i just had broken two other airtags while trying to remove the pcb and so you can see that i didn't have the patience anymore for a nice soldering job i thought about doing a nicer one for the video but i felt like showing this is more honest now a couple of weeks ago i started designing a raspberry pi pico based hardware hacking slash analysis device that includes level shifters and a mosfet for glitching and so on and so i used that for performing the actual attack however you can just as well put this together on a breadboard if you want to support my work on it i put a link to details in the description and this here is the final setup i used i'm using a jlink as the debugger and hook the attack directly up to the picobase board to check whether everything is working i also hooked up an oscilloscope the firmware on the raspberry pi pico is really simple it waits for the nf to be powered up then waits a configurable delay and then it glitches the chip for a configurable pulse width for the timing on where to glitch i again looked at limited results blog posts and saw that he glitches roughly where the cpu core voltage slightly dropped and so using the oscilloscope i roughly found that point in time and set it up for the pulse width i used the pulse width i used back in 2019 as i very extensively experimented with different ones back then to control the glitcher i wrote a simple python script in a jupyter notebook which gives nicer ui output than just doing this on a terminal as you can see it's really simple we loop through a delay range then we try two different pulls with and then we use openocd to check whether we can connect to the chip so let's start it and look at the oscilloscope we can see on the yellow line which is the cpu core voltage that our glitch is working but if we zoom out we can also see that our glitch jumps around a lot and so it's not great our timing is not very precise but remember we only have to get lucky once and after only a couple of minutes the script output what i hope to see success and indeed the debugger is able to connect to the chip and i can dump the firmware i just managed to hack the attacks yes and the cool thing is with the dump firmware i can flash other airtacks without having to glitch them this is because the lockdown nrf52 still allows for re-flashing i tested this on a second airtech and it works great next i wanted to see whether i can modify the firmware so i change the url that is sent when the attack is nfc skinned and what better thing to do than to try to rick roll people with an airtag and so when you scan my modified airtech you get a notification that you scan the youtube link and it leads you straight to rickroll yes so we've got a fully jailbroken airtech with which we can now experiment and i think it will be interesting to see what people build with this especially for research surrounding the e1 chip it will be really interesting and you might even be able to use the accelerometer of the attack as a makeshift microphone i hope you enjoyed this video and to see you on this channel again soon thank you apple's smart home actually got time on the main stage at wwdc and we're going to talk about all of the upgrades to siri and homepod and the apple tv right now so apple's home kit is getting more useful both in terms of its utility and its entertainment option and we're going to go through each of those things right now starting with entertainment and the apple tv so some of the apple tv upgrades feel like a better late than never situation such as you can launch content from your homepod with a voice command onto your apple tv i kinda think that should have been a feature for a long time now still it'll be nice to ask to watch a show on your smart speaker and have it pull up also you'll be able to use your home pod mini as speakers for your apple tv so you can set up a stereo pair make yourself a little surround sound setup which is pretty cool the apple tv is also getting better controls for smart home stuff so you'll be able to pull up the camera feed on your apple tv as you've been able to do for a while now but now you'll be able to see devices nearby the camera and can control them from the apple tv which is kind of cool you'll be able to see multiple camera feeds at once on your apple tv so bringing your entertainment and your smart home together into your entertainment system feels convenient next up the walls of apple's walled garden smart home approach are coming down a little bit not all the way but a little bit we'll take steps in the right direction we knew some of this was going to happen apple announced that they were going to participate in the matter smart home protocol they're partnering with google and with amazon and other big smart home companies to come up with a unified communications protocol so basically you'll be able to use your homepod to control nest thermostats and the like we knew this was going to happen but apple actually talked about it on their stage at wwdc which is kind of cool and confirmed matter is going to be a part of ios 15 their next operating software also you'll be able to use third-party devices to talk to siri which is pretty cool in the video they showed a person talking to siri on an ecobee thermostat apple said that they're still going to root those commands through a nearby homepod so again the walls of the garden aren't coming entirely down but it is still cool that you're getting that much more interoperability which was one of the things that limited apple's smart home was the limited number of devices this should help to fix that third apple is debuting a home app on the apple watch so you'll be able to natively control your smart home devices on your watch along with the announcement apple showed off home keys basically you integrate home kit with a smart lock and then you can just tap your watch or tap your phone to unlock your door which is pretty cool and convenient in addition to having that extra mobility of smart home controls lastly they're introducing package recognition to home kit cams so those should be getting smarter and they're bringing voice recognition to apple's smart speakers so you'll be able to compose text messages or launch personal playlists we've seen that stuff on the other smart speakers for a while now but again better late than never like some of this other stuff and as a whole a lot of these announcements are pretty exciting so integrating with apple tv and really nice smart home controls on the tv lowering the walls of that garden and making homekit play nice with your smart home as a whole i'm excited to see a lot of this stuff come to fruition thank you for watching con to let me know which of these features you're excited about and if you think apple's smart home can catch up to the competition please like and subscribe if you enjoyed the video and stay tuned for much more from apple's wwdc Black Brown Pink White Red Blue Red Blue Green Yellow Pink Orange >>>TIM COOK:
Good morning! Good morning! Good morning. Good morning. Good morning! Thanks for joining us. And welcome to San Francisco. Welcome to WWDC 2015. Although we may not
have any -- thank you -- high-flying trapeze acts, we
do have a lot of great things to talk about this morning. This developer conference
continues to be the epicenter of change for not only
Apple, but the industry. This is our 26th WWDC. We have attendees today
from over 70 countries, and 80 percent are here
for the very first time. [Applause] This is our most
global conference ever. And a special shout-out for
our 350 scholarship winners. [Cheers and applause] These guys are unbelievable. I spent some time
with them yesterday. Our youngest scholarship
winner is a 12-year-old girl from New York. She is going to have a
fantastic future ahead. [Applause] We've got over a hundred
sessions planned for you and over 150 labs so that
you can get your hands on our latest technologies. And we've got over a thousand
Apple engineers to answer just about any question
that you might have. Now, we've got a lot more
people that would have liked to have been here this
morning, but unfortunately, we just can't fit any
more in, as you can tell. And so for the first time, we're not only live
streaming the Keynote, but we are live streaming
30 sessions of the conference as well. [Applause] Now, before we get right to
the show, I'd like to bring up something that I saw on
the news just a few days ago. This is Brandon Moss of
the Cleveland Indians, and he hit his 100th career
home run last Tuesday. Obviously, it's a huge milestone
if you are a baseball player. Not a lot of people do this. And you can imagine how much that ball would mean
to him to have it. It turns out the ball was hit
into the Indians' bull pen, and his teammates decided to
play a bit of a prank on him. They decided to hold
it for ransom. And this is the list of
things they asked for. [Laughter] Apple Watches,
iPads, MacBook Airs, iPhones. It's unbelievable. It's a shopping list
for the Apple Store. [Applause] Now, Brandon would have
had to raid an Apple Store to get that ball back. That didn't seem quite right
to us, and so what we're going to do is we're going
to pay the ransom. And I have the ball right here. [Applause] We are giving the ball to
Brandon, and we are going to give everything his
teammates asked for to them so everybody is happy. So congratulations, Brandon,
on a hundred home runs, and good luck on
the next hundred. [Applause] Now, we've got a
jam-packed morning for you. We are going to get
started with OS X. We are bringing a whole bunch of new great capabilities
to the Macintosh. And next we've got a
great update for iOS, the world's most advanced
mobile operating system. And today we're bringing
native apps to the Watch with a new version. [Applause] With a new version
of the watchOS, which gives the developers
even more time to create even greater
apps for the Watch that will change the world. Now, all three of these
ecosystems together provide incredible opportunities
for developers and unbelievable
possibilities for users. So we are very excited
about this. There's a lot here, and
so I am going to dispense with my normal updates other than to tell you
everything's going great. [Laughter] [Applause] And I'd like to bring
out my friend and colleague Craig Federighi to
take you through OS X and iOS. Craig. [Applause] >> CRAIG FEDERIGHI:
Good morning! It's fantastic to be
with you here at WWDC. The team has been doing
some amazing work this year, and I am thrilled to be able
to share it with you today. We are going to start with OS X. Now, our current release,
Yosemite, is a big, bold, beautiful release
with a gorgeous new UI and breakthrough features like
Continuity that let you work across your devices
like never before. Now, the adoption rate for
Yosemite is just incredible. In fact, over 55 percent of active Mac users are
running our latest update, and this is just unprecedented
in the history of our industry. [Laughter] In fact, Yosemite
has the fastest adoption rate for any PC operating
system ever. So thank you. [Applause] So for our next big release of
OS X, we knew we wanted to build on those strengths of Yosemite with some really great
refinements and advances. The only real question, of
course, was what to call it. So we had to once again turn to
our crack Apple Marketing Team. Now, in typical California
fashion, they started with a project kickoff meeting. [Laughter] And then headed immediately
into a team building off site. [Laughter] Now, of course they are in their
traditional Apple Marketing Free-Bottom Fridays attire. They say it's all
part of their process. I am not sure I get it. Ultimately, this
didn't yield any names, so they called in a consultant. [Laughter] He told them the answer
was to be found within. Not within themselves,
but within Yosemite. And so the new name for
OS X is OS X El Capitan. [Applause] For El Capitan, we focused
in two major areas -- experience and performance. For experience, we've made
Spotlight more expressive, more powerful, and more
knowledgeable than ever. We've made big enhancements
to the apps you use most, and we made some real great
advancements in the area of how you manage
windows on the system. But rather than just talk about
it, I'd like to show it to you, so let's start with
a demo right now. [Applause] Now, your first task, of
course, in a demonstration or whenever you wake your
Mac, is finding the cursor, and El Capitan makes
this easier than ever. I just do that little
shake we all normally do, and there it is. It comes right out to greet you. It's really handy. [Applause] Now, we brought other great
gestures to the system. I am just going to
go here in Mail. I have a message here from Eddy. Looks like -- well, now --
[Laughter] -- that's a keeper. So I can actually mark
it unread to keep it just by swiping two fingers across
the trackpad just like that. And this one I'd kind of like
to delete, so I am just going to swipe it away just like that. So some real nice
little gestures. Let's move on now to Safari. Now, in Safari, I have some
sites that I like to keep around because I refer to them
on and off throughout the day, and now in Safari, I can pin
those sites just like this. So there's -- I am going to
pin my Twitter site here. And of course I have been
following the Warriors. Go Warriors, we are
going to get it done. [Applause] Just like that. Now, Pinned Sites have a
lot of special properties. For one, if I close this
window and reopen it, you see that my Pinned
Sites are all right there, and they load instantly. Now, Pinned Sites also behave
differently when I follow links, so I am just going
to click on one here, and you notice it opens in a new
tab, but my pinned site remains. Now I am going to open
up a couple more links. This one, let's see, this one. I will take a quick look. This one looks like some
kind of presentation video. This one is about the Giants. Have you ever had
this happen to you? You are like, Where is
this audio coming from? Now with just a tap,
you can mute it or find out where it came from and
shut it down just like that. [Applause] So I am interested in
seeing this Giants game, and now Spotlight can
actually help me out there. So I am just going to do a
search for the SF Giants, and we see right now I
get current game scores, upcoming games. Looks like the game I want
to go to is on Friday, so I can just search
for weather on Friday. See we get the weather. We can even resize the Spotlight
panel and move it around. I mean, there's innovation; huh? [Laughter] But I can also
express myself in my own words in Spotlight searches now, so
I can do things like slides from Brian, and you
see I find those there. But how about slides from
Brian about El Capitan? You see, I find exactly what I
am looking for in my own words. Now, this works great
in other apps as well. Let's try it out in Mail. So I've been really busy, of
course, the last couple of days, so I have been getting a
little behind on my Mail. I want to see the messages
that I've received from Phil but that I haven't
responded to yet. So I am just going to say
"mail I ignored from Phil." [Laughter] There are a few,
but I will be getting back to him right after the show. [Laughter] So next, of course,
it's great in the Finder as well, so if I wanted to look
at documents that I was working on last year at this time,
I might say something like "documents I worked
on last June." And I find exactly
what I am looking for. So this is really a
great way to search. Next I want to turn to window
management, so I am just going to run a script here that's
going to open up a whole bunch of windows to simulate kind
of what my desktop looks like after a day working on OS
X because it's a powerful system and we tend to have
a lot of things open. OS X provides some great ways
to navigate your windows, and one of those
is Mission Control. In El Capitan, we made
Mission Control smoother, simpler, and faster than ever. I am going to take three fingers
and swipe up on the trackpad. We get this gorgeous
overview of Mission Control. I'll just bring forward Safari. Let's do that again
and bring up Mail. Just like that. Works really great. Of course, OS X provides
great tools also to organize your windows, and
one of those is Full Screen. I am going to take this
window here full screen, and I am going to reply. Looks like there's a
message here from Eddy. He says sorry about bailing
on the team dinner last night. He was apparently
prepping for the Keynote. So that's understandable. But it looks like, actually,
I just got a new mail from Jeff here, and now I can
just click away, and it hides, and then -- oh, hold on. Busted, Eddy. So I think I'll just
drag this, actually, right into my Compose window,
it hops up automatically, and I can do it just like that. It's really great. And I can even open up
tabs in Compose as well. It's really handy. So this is a great way now to
work in full screen in Mail. [Applause] Thank you. Now, we've done something
totally new to El Capitan, and it's the ability
to work really easily on two windows side by side. So I am just going to click and
hold here on the green button. And you see it's
prompting me to pick a side. I will just drop it in. And you notice I get an expose
of all my other windows. Let me pick the new News
app, just like that. [Applause] Of course, I can
resize this window to style it just the way I want. How about that blur? Again, innovation. [Laughter] So, great
way to work. Here I can drag links,
for instance, from Safari right in here. You notice in the new Notes app,
I get a beautiful graphical link that gives me a nice thumbnail that helps me identify
what I dragged in there. I am going to drag
in some yurts. I think yurts, first
time mentioned on the WWDC Keynote stage. There you go. Got some yurts here. Great way to work split screen. We've also provided a really
easy way to move windows into their own desktops. So let me just take this window
here, I'm just going to drag it up past the top of the screen,
and drop it in just like that. So easy. I can also do this
to take a window full screen. So let's take Photos, just
drop it in right here, I took it full screen. Check this out. I am going to take
Messages, drop it on Photos, and create a split
view just like that. Totally awesome. [Applause] And that is a quick look
at some improvements to the experience in El Capitan. [Applause] So we saw in El Capitan
a powerful form of search in Spotlight that lets
you compose your searches in your own words. It knows more than ever, can look up weather,
stocks, game scores. We saw gestures, for instance,
just swiping to delete in Mail. And, of course, pin
sites in Safari and the ability to
easily mute tabs. A great new Notes app that
supports text styling, checklists, and graphical links. And better window
management than ever with a beautiful new
Mission Control interface, easy access to your
spaces bar, and of course, the ability to do split
view and adjust it to see exactly what
you are looking for, every pixel of your display
devoted to your content. Of course, there's much more
to experience in El Capitan, but now I want to
turn to performance. So we've optimized performance
throughout the system. In fact, we are seeing about
a 1.4 times acceleration in app launching,
a 2x improvement in the snappiness
of switching apps. The time to get first Mail
messages, twice as fast. Opening a PDF in preview,
four times as fast. But we've also made deep
architectural improvements, and that brings us to Metal. [Applause] Thank you. Last year we introduced
Metal at WWDC as a way to accelerate graphics in
high-performance games. It takes the overhead
out of OpenGL, providing a high-performance API that gives the game
direct access to the power of the underlying
graphics hardware. Well, this year we are
bringing Metal to the Mac. And we are doing more than that. Because we are taking the
graphic stacks on which apps on OS X are built, Core
Animation and Core Graphics, and moving them from OpenGL to
run natively on top of Metal, making everything you do faster. We are seeing 50
percent improvements in rendering performance
and a 40 percent reduction in the amount of CPU
necessary to do graphics. That means improved performance
for your applications and better battery life. But the benefits of
Metal don't stop there. Metal's also great for
high-performance apps. In fact, Metal combines
the compute power of OpenCL and the graphics power of OpenGL in a higher performance
API that does both. And what we've seen from working with early pro developers
is really phenomenal. Adobe came in and,
in short order, was able to deliver an
eight times improvement in their rendering effects
inside of After Effects, and they have been able
to take the drawing engine in Illustrator, move it on top
of Metal, and take kinds of UI that previously was
noninteractive, like zoom of extremely
detailed drawings, and make it completely flawless and interactive,
thanks to Metal. Adobe is so pleased with this
they said they are committed to adopting Metal
on their OS X apps, seeing performance
increases up to 8x. They are excited
about what it can do for their Creative Cloud users. Of course, Metal is
also fantastic for games with a 10x improvement. That's ten times improvement
in drawing performance. So we brought in Epic to
see what they could do in short order, and the
results are really phenomenal. I'd like to welcome to
the stage Josh Adams and Billy Bramer
for a quick demo. [Applause] >> Thank you,
Craig. Thank you very much for
having us here today. So last year Metal
revolutionized graphics on iOS, and now Apple's amazed us again
by bringing Metal to the Mac. Of course, this is
great news for games, but also for the tools that
we use to make those games. Here you are seeing Epic's
upcoming multiplayer title Fortnite, running
entirely on Metal. We are modifying it directly
within the Unreal Engine, a development tool that powers
many of today's best games. It's quite a bit going
on in this scene, though, so let's break it down. First, there are
64 different layers of rendering effects,
and that's a lot. All combining together, though, to produce what you
see on the scene today. If we go into a simple wireframe
mode, you can see the thousands of building blocks that
make up this world. We can start to add in layers,
flat shading, detailed lighting, runtime shadows, and finally
we combine them all together to bring Fortnite's fun and
lighthearted aesthetic to life. The interesting thing
here, though, is that all of the effects
you are seeing are being done completely in real-time. Notice how the shadows and
objects interact nicely as Josh moves the car around. Finally, we can change the
time of day on the fly, dramatically altering the
mood of the entire scene. All of this is thanks to
the efficiency of Metal. In fact, we are seeing
a 70 percent reduction in CPUs compared to OpenGL,
enabling developers like us to create richer 3D worlds. Speaking of those worlds, let's
hop into the game, Fortnite. Now, if you've ever
built a pillow fort and battled imaginary
monsters with your friends, you already know how
to play Fortnite. This is the end-of-the-world
scenario you have been training for since you were a kid. It's a beautifully
stylized universe. You can destroy anything
you want. Gather resources
and build a fort. So let's go ahead
and wreck this car. Gather its metal. And continue our wanton
destruction by chopping down this tree to get
some wood for later. Did we mention there
are purple death storms, like this one, for instance? We should go. Luckily, while we were out
exploring, we found a multitude of weapons, and this broom. If we can just get
across the field, our friend has been busy
building a fort across the -- did we mention the storms
are made of monsters? We are going to need something
a bit better than this broom. Nice! There's our friend
laying down some covering fire. >> Hey,
look out! >> We call that move
the power cord. I've got a bad feeling
about this. You are going to
need a bigger fort. Place a trap, head inside. Looks like an enemy has
broken into our fort. All right. Let's use that wood we gathered
earlier to fix this wall, build some stairs, meet up
with our friend topside. >> Glad you could
make it. [Monster screaming] >> Whether you are a
gamer or a game developer, Metal opens new possibilities
for rich and engaging worlds. You can download the Unreal
Engine for Mac right now, and the Fortnite beta
for Mac starts this fall. Thank you very much. [Cheers and applause] >> CRAIG FEDERIGHI:
Thank you, guys. That was great. We have been totally impressed
with what Epic has been able to accomplish in
such a short time. And this is in part because the
work they did to adopt Metal in their rendering engines for
iOS immediately pays dividends on OS X, and we are seeing
this with many other developers as well who are bringing their
gaming engines immediately to the Mac. And pro app makers are seeing
the benefits of Metal as well, people like The Foundry
and Autodesk. I think we are going to
see pro users, gamers, and all of us benefiting from the performance
advantages of Metal. So that is El Capitan,
improvements to experience and performance. Now, El Capitan is available
to all of you developers today. [Applause] We will be doing a public
beta once again in July, and we will be rolling
out to everyone with a free upgrade this fall. And that's our update on OS X. [Applause] Next -- you guessed it -- iOS. Now, our current big
release of iOS is iOS 8, and iOS 8 was a huge release
with tons of new features for users and a phenomenal
set of technologies that you developers
have been able to use to deliver all-new
experiences to the platform. The upgrade rate for
iOS has been fantastic. We have 83 percent of active
iPhone users currently running the latest OS. And this is really important because it means not only are
they getting the most recent features, but they're also up to
date on all the security fixes, and you're able to
know as a developer that you can target
all the users with the latest and
greatest APIs. And this is a benefit that actually remains
really unique to iOS. [Applause] So we are now looking forward
to iOS 9, and as we conceived of what we wanted to
accomplish, first and foremost, we wanted to elevate the
foundations of the platform, things like extending
your battery life, improving performance,
and enhancing security to protect customer data. But there was more
we wanted to do. Adding intelligence throughout
the user experience in a way that enhances how
you use your device but without compromising
your privacy. Things like improving the
apps that you use most and taking the experience of
the iPad to the next level. I want to start today with
intelligence and Siri. Now, Siri has quietly
become incredibly popular. It serves over a billion
requests per week. And this is in part because
Siri has gotten so great at understanding
what we are saying. In just the last year, we've
seen a 40 percent reduction in word error rate,
down to 5 percent. That's an industry
leading number. And Siri is 40 percent
faster than ever at responding to what we say. Now, for iOS 9, Siri has a
beautiful new UI and is capable of doing so much more. Things like "show me photos from Utah last August" can
instantly show you the right photos from your photo library. And Siri's really great
at taking reminders. Now you can ask Siri
things like "remind me to grab my coffee off the
roof of my car when I get in." Because Siri knows now when
you've gotten in the car. And of course, we often want
to take reminders about things that we are looking at on our
device, some content inside of our app, maybe a Safari. Now you can say things
like "remind me about this when I get home," and that
reminder refers right back with a link to specifically
what you were looking at when you took that reminder. So Siri is a great assistant. But the best assistants
are proactive. And so on iOS 9, we are
bringing proactivity throughout the system. So say you like to run in
the morning, and when you do, you like to listen to music. Well, now your phone can
learn that about you, and when you plug
in your headphones, can offer up Now Playing
automatically right on the Lock screen. [Applause] And this is all
context-sensitive to the time, the place, and even the
devices you are connected to, so you do the same thing in the
car later on, and it might offer up the audio book that you
have been listening to. Now, as a great assistant, your iPhone can now take
invitations you receive in your email and without you
even touching them automatically put them on your calendar
and even give you a time to leave reminder, taking into account current traffic
conditions, and of course, with just a swipe, give you
access to driving directions. Now, have you ever had this
happen to you, you get a call, the number looks
kind of familiar, but you are really
not sure who it is? As a great assistant, your
phone can now look in your email and find out who that person
might be and suggest it to you right on the
Incoming Call screen. It's super handy. [Applause] Now, this kind of
proactivity is also great when it comes to Search. So now when you swipe to the
left of the Home screen to get to Search, you see that Siri
offers great suggestions, things like the people that you
might want to contact now based on your upcoming meetings and
your communication patterns, the apps that you might want
to launch based, for instance, on what you just downloaded
from the App Store and haven't yet tried out, or apps you
tend to use this time of day, and also easy one-tap
links to locations that are relevant nearby,
and even breaking news. When it comes to Search, we
also know more than ever before. So for instance, you can
search for sports scores. And we now support video
search, of popular video sites like Vivi, Vimeo, YouTube,
and the iTunes Store. And we have these
great descriptive cards with a Play button so
you can play directly from your search result. Most importantly, we now
have an API for Search. [Applause] So now when a user
performs a search, we can find content behind
the apps they have installed on the device and pull those up
in Results, and when they tap, they are deep-linked
directly into the application. You see for instance
here Airbnb. They can get their result. Of course, we even provide
a convenient backlink so they can get right back
to their search results. So we think these kinds of intelligence features
really make a huge difference in your experience in iOS. And to show you how, I would like to give you
a quick demo now. So I want to take you through
a day in the life with iOS 9, and we are going to start with
a typical day for me today. We are going to start
in my bedroom when I woke up in the morning. You will notice because my phone
knows that in the morning I like to meditate that it's
offered me a meditation app right here in the bottom
left of the screen. So I can just swipe up
from the bottom left, and I am taken right
in to meditate. Ah, this is so serene. Well, it looks like I got
a message here from Phil. So Phil says that he is
putting together the invite for tonight's big karaoke
potluck, and can I still pick up this super awesome
karaoke machine? Well, you know, Siri actually,
when I take reminders, is able to link me right back
to what I am looking for, so if I want to remember to pick
this up, I can just say this to Siri: "Remind me
about this later today." And so Siri will put
together a reminder, and you see the link right
back to what I am looking for. Well, I think after all,
meditation isn't probably for me, so maybe I'll
move on to exercise. So I head into the home gym
here, and because my phone knows that when I am in the home gym
and I hook up headphones and I like to listen to music,
watch what happens when I plug in the cord of my headphones. Jumps right in and offers
me some energetic music. So let's all bust a move. I don't know what kind of exercise we are all
doing here, but pretty good. Looks like actually
I've got that invitation that Phil was going to send me. Now, normally I would have
to actually go into Mail, look at the time, put this
on my Calendar, but in fact, my phone has automatically
done that for me. Let me just swipe down here
into Notifications Center, and we will look at my
calendar for the day. You notice it automatically has
already been added right there. Now, if we look at
the rest of my day, ahead I have my vocal warm-ups for the karaoke performance,
then WWDC. It looks like I have
a little bit of time to prepare my dish
for the big potluck. So I am going to head
into the kitchen now, and let's just swipe in. When I am looking for
recipes, for instance, I like to go into Search. Let's just swipe
over into Search. We see Siri has actually already
-- before I typed a character -- made suggestions for me
for people I could contact, for instance, like Trent
Reznor, my vocal coach. [Laughter] So I can just tap. Here I can call Trent up,
and he can help me tap into my inner pain and
rage that allows me to fuel my vocal performances. I actually haven't been
able to find the pain and rage, truth be told. Also, we have all these
great apps I can run and locations nearby -- for
instance, because it's morning, you see coffee and tea and
breakfast places are suggested. As well as news. But in this case, I
actually want to do a search. So I have some potatoes
I think I could make use of in this recipe. So let's just search for potato. Here you notice I am
getting search results right from Yummly. Let me tap into Yummly, and you
see I am deep-linked directly in, so I get the great view
provided by that application. Now, potato chips aren't
exactly what I am looking for, so I am going to hit
the Back link here, and I can browse directly in to another result,
Canadian Poutine. That looks exactly like
what the doctor ordered. Yes. Let's look at
the ingredients. Looks like 6 tablespoons
of unsalted butter. I am down with that. I am going to make at
least a double batch. So I can just use Search to do
a conversion of tablespoons, figure out how much that is. So that actually
is 3/4 of a cup. I am going to round
up to an even quart and make myself some
fine poutine. [Laughter] So Search
is really handy, but Siri is also
great at search. So I want to jump
forward to later today. When I think I will be
reminiscing about WWDC's past. I can ask Siri to
help me with that. Show my photos from last
June in San Francisco. Oh, yeah, this is great,
all these photos from WWDC. You notice now Photos in iOS
9 has this great scrubber bar at the bottom, so
I can easily slide through photos super
quickly, just like this. Oh, boy, now we are
into the karaoke night. This is some fine stuff. Phil really does an
awesome Viking crooner. This is good stuff. But of course, the
king of karaoke -- [Laughter] -- Eddy Cue. In fact, when I want to get
really pumped up and inspired for karaoke night,
I like to turn to my Eddy karaoke album,
so let's do that now. Show my karaoke photos of Eddy. Oh, that is the master at work. Hitting -- I love this hat. [Laughter] This is totally dope. Great stuff. Well, I could really look
at these just all day, but you know, actually, my assistant has given
me a reminder based on traffic conditions that it's
time to leave, so I am going to wrap up this demo of
intelligence on iOS 9. [Cheers and applause] So you've seen how
we've been able to bring intelligence throughout
the experience in iOS 9, but we do it in a way that does
not compromise your privacy. We don't mine your email,
your photos, or your contacts in the cloud to learn
things about you. We honestly just
don't want to know. All of this is done on
device, and it stays on device, under your control. [Cheers and applause] And if we do have to perform
a lookup on your behalf, for example, for current traffic
conditions, it's anonymous, it's not associated with your
Apple ID, it's not linked with other Apple services, and it's not shared
with third parties. Why would do you that? It is in your control. That is intelligence in iOS 9. [Applause] Next, let's turn to Apple Pay. And to take you through
it, I'd like to bring to the stage our Vice President of our Apple Pay
business, Jennifer Bailey. Jennifer. [Cheers and applause] >> JENNIFER BAILEY:
Thanks, Craig. It's great to be here. We have been hard at work on our
goal of replacing the wallet, and we've got some exciting
updates for you today. I hope you've all tried Apple
Pay with our super easy, secure, and private way to pay. Last year we started with credit
and debit cards, and we now have over 2,500 banks
supporting Apple Pay. And this fall, Discover will
bring Apple Pay to the more than 50 million card members. [Applause] Popular merchants are also
expanding their acceptance for Apple Pay, including
great retailers who will be supporting
Apple Pay this year, including Trader Joe's,
Baskin-Robbins, and JCPenny. These incredible brands join
a great list of the biggest and best merchants
supporting Apple Pay since our launch in October. And for you are basketball
fans, if you are lucky enough to have finals tickets,
you will be able to pay for all your team logo wear at
both arenas using Apple Pay. [Applause] Small businesses are
also important for us, so we are working with
innovative companies like Square to enable millions of small
businesses to accept Apple Pay. This fall, Square will
launch a gorgeous new reader. Preorders are starting
today on square.com, and these will be available in our Apple Retail
Stores starting this fall. With fantastic support of
merchants, both large and small, we will surpass 1 million
locations accepting Apple Pay next month. [Applause] And thanks to our
amazing developers, we have great momentum
within apps as well. Apple Pay is so easy
to use in-app, our developers are telling
us they are seeing more than two times increase
in checkout rates. And we are adding new
apps with Apple Pay to the App Store every day. Here are some of the latest,
representing a great range of categories, from
Delta in travel to Etsy, the leading crafts marketplace. These apps join an incredible
group that are redefining new and simpler ways to pay. We're also excited to be
working with Pinterest. Later this month, Pinterest
will launch Buyable Pins, where you will be able to buy
items from thousands of stores, including Neiman
Marcus and Macy's, right from within the
Pinterest app using Apple Pay, and only on iOS. [Applause] With the great momentum
of Apple Pay in the U.S., we are now excited to announce that we are bringing
Apple Pay to the UK. [Cheers and applause] And it's coming next month! [Applause] We will launch with eight
of the most popular banks, with more coming this fall. With this great lineup of
banks, we will support more than 70 percent of the credit
and debit cards in the UK. Great merchants are also
lining up to support Apple Pay, like Boots, Costa Coffee,
and iconic British brands, like Marks and Spencer
and Waitrose. We will have over 250,000
locations supporting Apple Pay in the UK. That's more than we
started with in the U.S. at our initial launch. We are also thrilled that
our customers will be able to commute and pay
for their fares on the London transportation
system with Apple Pay. [Applause] So that's Apple Pay
coming to the UK. Now let's talk about
some of the new features that we are adding in iOS 9. First, you will be
able to add your store, credit, and debit cards. Store cards offer unique
membership benefits, and leading retailers
like Kohl's, JCPenney, and BJs will be the first to
offer their cards on Apple Pay. We will also add loyalty
and rewards cards, also with a great
lineup of merchants. Kohl's will bring
Yes2You programs, Walgreens their Balance Rewards
card, and for your coffee and doughnut lovers, Dunkin'
Donuts will bring Apple Pay to their DDPerks
beginning this fall. [Applause] and Apple Pay automatically
presents the right card, so you will never miss a reward. With the expansion of Apple
Pay and the new types of cards, we decided it's time to
rename Passbook to Wallet. [Applause] One place for all your credit
and debit cards, loyalty cards, boarding passes, and more. We told you last year
that our ultimate goal was to replace the wallet,
and we are well on the way to doing just that. We couldn't be happier with
the progress towards our vision and with the momentum
of Apple Pay. Thank you. [Applause] >> CRAIG FEDERIGHI:
So that's Apple Pay. Let's turn now to
our enhancements to the apps you use most, and we
are going to start with Notes. Notes is used regularly by about
half of our users on iPhone, and for iOS 9, we have some
really great enhancements. It starts with how you
work with simple text. So now Notes provides
a really handy toolbar with formatting options,
so it's easy, for instance, to create titles, heading
styles, numbered lists. But of course, we all like to
create checklists in our notes, and so Notes makes
that really easy. And of course, you can
just check off your items with just a tap. Now, because a picture is
worth a thousand words, we make it easy to get at your
camera and your camera roll and put photos directly
in your notes. We are also providing a great
new way to capture your ideas by just drawing with
your finger. We provide some great
drawing tools. You can make sketches
with these tools and drop them right
inside your note. [Applause] Now, I don't know
if you are like me, but a lot of times the
things I want to put on my notes are things I
am looking at that I find in other apps -- for
instance, a web page in Safari. So now from the Share
sheet, you can just with a tap add a link
right back into your notes. And we make it really
easy to find your notes. So we organize them
by time, of course, and now we have these
great thumbnails to let you see your
embedded images at a glance, but we also provide this
cool new Attachments view that shows you all of your
photos, your maps links, your website links, and when
you tap, you can get right back to the note where
they came from. Now, Notes is great
on iPhone, on iPad, and of course, on
the Mac as well. And all of your content is
kept up to date across all of your devices via iCloud. That's a quick update to Notes. [Applause] Next, let's turn to Maps. We've continued to
invest heavily in Maps, and the improvements
are really awesome. We are seeing five billion
user requests per week. Usage on iOS is 3.5 times higher than for the next
leading mapping app. Now, Maps, of course, historically have been
focused on drivers. They emphasize things
like freeways and roads. But we know for a lot of our iOS
users, they are mostly focused on public transit, and so now
we've created a great map just for them. [Applause] Yes, it's Transit. [Applause] With Transit, we provide
a map that emphasizes all of the different transit
lines, buses, and trains, subway stations and so forth,
and when you tap on a station, you can see all the
lines that run through it with their departure times. And we do multimodal routing,
whether you are taking a train, a subway, a bus, or a ferry. And we provide step-by-step
directions, including time for walking directions. But we've taken special care
to get the details right, the ones that matter,
with Transit. For instance, if you take a
subway station like this one in Columbus Circle in New York,
it's not just a point on a map. If you look closer, it's actually an enormous
underground structure spanning many city blocks, and so
we carefully surveyed all of the entrances and exits so that we could give you
walking directions based on the time to travel from
where you actually are. Now, this not only saves
you a ton of walking, but it also probably
is the difference between catching your train
on time and being stuck. [Applause] It's really great. [Applause] We've taught Siri all about
Transit, so it's effortless to ask Siri for directions. And we are going to be
rolling Maps out, Transit, starting with these cities
across the world, and -- [Applause] -- with these
and 300 more in China. [Applause] Now, when it comes
to searching in Maps, we are now letting
you find locations by type nearby with just a tap. And when you find the
location you are interested in, the card will tell you
right away right there in the bottom whether
they support Apple Pay. Support those Apple
Pay merchants. [Applause] Maps is great on
iPhone and iPad, and of course, the Mac as well. And that is Maps. [Applause] The apps that we've chosen
to build in to iOS are there because they represent
fundamental experiences to living on a mobile device. And there's been one that we've
been wanting to do for years, something that so many of
us find ourselves wanting to do every day on our device,
and so today I'm pleased to announce that we are
introducing a new application, and it's called News. News is beautiful content from the world's greatest
sources personalized for you. Now, here's an article in News. It's absolutely stunning. Now, publishers can easily
create beautiful content using gorgeous imagery, custom
layout, and rich typography. But News is also interactive,
and so to give you a look at News in action,
I'd like to invite to the stage our Vice
President of Application, Product Management,
Susan Prescott. Susan. [Cheers and applause] >> SUSAN PRESCOTT:
Thanks, Craig. Thank you. I am really excited
to be the first person to show you our new News app. It's right here on
the Home screen. The first thing News wants to do
is get a sense of what I like, so it's going to
give me a short list of really great choices
to choose from. And you'll see as I tap,
additional recommendations come in on the bottom to give
you even more choices. So I read Atlantic, Wired,
New York Times, and ESPN. I am still with you, Warriors! And Daring Fireball. Topics, too, like science,
baking, and travel. I could keep going, but I
think that's a great start, so I will tap Done. News creates a personalized
feed called For You. It's based on the
choices I just made, and it's all my News
in one place. You can see it looks great. It's easy to scan, and it
updates every time I check News. The articles can
come from anywhere, but the best ones are built
in our new Apple News format, like this Wired article
featuring Rashida Jones, awesome in Parks &
Rec and The Office. Look at the rich
typography, beautiful images, and my favorite part are
the really fun animations. It's fast and fluid. We think this offers the best
mobile reading experience ever. To get to the next
article, I just swipe. It's not just great
for magazines; it's great for newspapers too. This is a New York Times
article, and it looks like a New York Times article. Swipe down, there's a photo
gallery right in line, fast, fluid to swipe through. Go to the next article,
this one's from Quartz, but I am seeing it because I
said I am interested in science. It's a pretty cool
article about a font based on Albert Einstein's
handwriting. The animation makes it
come to life, and frankly, who knew he had such
neat handwriting? It's kind of interesting. Swipe again, and I get an
article from Bon Appetit. Great summer recipes, and a crazy little jiggly
thing, which is kind of fun. [Laughter] So I am a little
busy right now, so I am going to go ahead and bookmark
this to read later. Now, ESPN, I love you, Steph. [Applause] Now, I read ESPN
for the articles, but there's also
some beautiful -- [Laughter] -- photos and videos. [Cheers and applause] Some photos and videos built in. Not so much last night. Let's see if Steph
can make this one. Swish. All right. He is going to be
there for us next game. In addition, data and stats are
part of what's fun about sports, so of course, rich info
graphics can be part of it. I am going to swipe
back to For You. Now, News is smart, so the
more I read, the better it gets at showing me stories
I am interested in. But what if I want to
discover something new? I can tap here in the bottom
on Explore, and Explore, based on what I've read, will show me new publisher
channels I might be interested in and suggested topics. Well, I love technology. I am going to go
ahead and follow that. But News keeps track of
more than a million topics. So I can be much more
specific about my interests. To do that, I can tap
on Search and type. I am going to type Swift. And I get a number of hits,
everything from Taylor Swift, to what I was looking for, Apple's new programming
language. So it's a beautiful feed,
and what's really cool about this is there are powerful
machine learning algorithms that analyze the contents
of the articles to figure out which stories
belong in which article. This looks like just
what I was hoping for. I am going to go ahead and
add Swift to my Favorites. So let's take a look
at Favorites. I will tap down here. Favorites is where I can see
everything I am following, including Swift,
which I just added. It's a great place to
go if I want to dig into a particular
topic or if I want to read a newspaper
or a magazine. Let's say today I
want to read Wired. You can tell I am in
the Wired channel. You see the Wired
logo at the top and the Wired channel
starting with Top Stories. I can swipe through and see a
collection of the all the print and web stories built
in Apple News format, and it looks terrific. I am going to look
at one more story. This is about the first
civilian artist in space. Cool concept and really cool. I want to show you this. We've taken photo
galleries to the next level with something we
call Photo Mosaics. Look how beautiful
it looks on the page. Stunning. And, as you'd expect, I just tap to zoom
in on the photos. It looks great. We think there's never been a
more beautiful magazine reading experience, a mobile reading
experience in general, and this is just
one of many channels with beautiful stories
built in Apple News format. That is a really
quick look at News. We can't wait to get
it in your hands. Thank you very much. [Cheers and applause] >> CRAIG FEDERIGHI:
So that's News. Stunning content. Personalized for you. Fantastic on iPad and
on iPhone as well. And of course, unlike just about any other news
aggregation service we are aware of on the planet, News is
designed from the ground up with your privacy in mind. We worked with leading
publishers, like The New York Times, who will be delivering 33
articles daily to News users, and ESPN, who will be
bringing the depth and range of their phenomenal
sports reporting. And Conde Nast, who are
bringing content from 17 of their magazines, like
Vanity Fair, Vogue, GQ, Wired, and Bon Appetite. And they will be joined
by many, many others read by millions of users daily. News isn't just for
the media titans. Great content comes from
all kinds of sources, and we want them all in News, so
whether it's a local newspaper, a blog, or a special-interest
publication, they will all be here. We will be rolling out News
starting in the United States, the UK, and Australia. We think you are
really going to like it. [Applause] Next, let's turn to iPad. Now, iPad is a transformational
device. For our users in education,
business, and at home, for many of them, their iPad
is their primary computer. And iPads are just tremendously
powerful, so in iOS 9, we are elevating the iPad
experience to a whole new level. Now, it starts with
something really simple, which is how you work with text. That brings us to the
QuickType keyboard. Now, in iOS 8, we
introduced the Suggestion bar that makes it quicker
than ever to type and enter what you
are trying to get in. But now, in iOS 9, we've
added shortcuts to that bar, so with just a tap, you can cut,
copy, paste, format your text, access your attachments. It's really handy. But you know, what makes
a Multi-Touch keyboard so special is that it
can be anything you want. It can transform. So now when you want to move
the cursor or make a selection, you can now just put two
fingers down on the keyboard, and it becomes a
trackpad instantly. [Applause] You can move the cursor,
you can make selections. Of course, you can use
the shortcut bar to cut, drag to a new place, and
paste, editing more quickly than ever before and without
your fingers ever leaving the home row. It's really great. [Applause] And if you do occasionally want
to hook a physical keyboard to your iPad as well, we
made that better than ever. We provide a way to
discover all of the shortcuts that can accelerate
your operations in the applications
using the keyboard, and we've provided
shortcuts for app switching. This might look familiar
to some of you. As well as to searching
in Spotlight. So that's QuickType, but now
I want to turn to the big one, and that's Multitasking. [Applause] So iPad has always supported
forms of multitasking, like this great graphical
task switcher, and these nice four-finger
gestures that let you move
between applications. But for iOS 9, we are taking
it to a whole new place, and I'd like to show
that to you now. [Applause] So let's start here on my iPad. And what I am going to
do first is double-tap on the Home button, and you
will see our new task switcher. It's really gorgeous. Big, full-screen
previews of all the apps. Just move right into
Safari like this. But of course, often when
I am in an app like Safari, I then just want to
quickly check my messages. So now with just a single
finger swipe from the side, I can slide it right in with
what we call Slide Over. Of course, it's fully
interactive. I can take a quick look,
maybe type a response, put it right back,
I am back in Safari. Do that again. From the top, I can pull down
and bring in other applications. So let's bring in Calendar. Of course, fully interactive
so I can tap into another day. Let's bring in another app. I am going to bring
in the new Notes app. Just like that. Now, sometimes, of course, I
want to stay working in Notes and Safari both at the same
time, so I can just tap here on the divider, and
now I am in split view. They are both completely active. In fact, for the first time
ever, multiapp, Multi-Touch, I can move them both
at the same time. [Applause] Now, Notes is actually
pinned to the side now, so I want to show you what
happens when I switch apps. I am just going to move
over here to Photos. You notice now I have Photos
with Notes on the side. This is really great if I am
taking notes while working across a bunch of experiences. And of course those four-finger
gestures continue to work great, so I can swipe my way
right back into Safari. I can follow links, of
course, from my notes. Let me tap on this link, and you
see Safari loads it right here on the side. I can adjust the split. Let me move that over
to a nice 50/50 view with Notes and Safari. I can tap on links
to other apps, so let's follow a
link into Maps. Maps -- I really want
location accuracy. Thank you, very helpful. Slides right in and
shows me the location. I can follow another
link, Maps adjusts, I am able to stay
focused right here in these two apps side by side. Let's say I now want to
work Notes full screen. I can pull right
across like that and I am in full-screen Notes. This gives me a great
opportunity to show you what's new with
the QuickType keyboard. I have a to-do list
I am building here. I am going to add an item
here to buy a new ice chest. There we go. On second thought, I
should probably borrow one. I am going to take two fingers down on the keyboard,
swipe over here. I can reposition the
cursor like this. Tap and make a selection. Extend the selection. And type "borrow." It's really easy. I can make bigger moves too. I can go to the top here, maybe
select the whole sentence, drag down, maybe do a checklist
like this, and check them off. Just like that. Super cool. [Applause] Next I want to show you
multitasking in the context of something I think we all
do quite a bit on our iPads, which is not that --
which is watching ESPN. So let's bring up a video. I am going to play right here. Now, often when I am watching
a video, I may decide I want to look something up
or check something or maybe even get a
notification, and I want you to watch what happens
when I tap. Watch the video. Now I have Picture in Picture. [Applause] So I can still listen, I
can watch my video, I can, of course, resize the
PIP if I want, like this. I can move it around the
screen so it's out of the way of what I am working on. I can even move it off the side. Sometimes I just want to listen
for a while while I work. Of course, it stays
with me wherever I go. I can pull it back,
and when I am done, just tap to put it away. And that is Multitasking
in iOS 9. [Applause] So iOS 9 delivers this great
app switcher, and of course, that's available
on iPhone as well. On iPad, we have Slide
Over so you can bring apps in from the side. You can tap and enter split view for simultaneous
live two apps up. And of course, Picture
in Picture. Now, we provide developer APIs
to let your apps work this way, and the good news is that you've
already done most of that work because if you've adopted
Auto Layout and size classes to work great on the iPhone 6
and 6 Plus, well, that carries over just like this onto iPad. Twitter came in and was able
to do it just in minutes. It was really incredible. Now, Slide Over is available
for the iPad Air, Air 2, mini 2, and mini 3, as is
Picture in Picture, and our most powerful
split view is available on our most powerful
iPad, the iPad Air 2. That's Multitasking. [Applause] So we've seen some
great end-user features, but of course, we've also
focused on the foundations. In performance, as you saw
earlier in El Capitan with OS X, we've taken the core frameworks
that we use for drawing on the system, Core
Animation and Core Graphics, and we put them on top of Metal. We are seeing great
acceleration, 1.6 times improvements in
animations and scrolling, and a 50 percent reduction
in CPU usage for drawing. It's really great. With battery life, we focused on real-world use cases
and optimized them. And we are seeing an addition
of one hour of typical use on a full charge on iPhone. [Applause] Now, we know that for a lot
of you if you are running low on power, you start searching
all over for switches and turning off features
in the hope of extending your battery
life a little bit further. Well, now in iOS 9, we
give you a single switch to enter what we call Low
Power mode, and it pulls levers that you didn't even
know existed and is able to extend battery life for
an additional three hours of typical use on top
of that additional hour. It's really great. [Applause] Now, with security, we want
to protect our users' data on device and in the cloud, and so we are bringing
two-factor authentication and making it easy for everyone
to protect their data in iCloud. And with Software Update, we
want everyone to get to iOS 9, and so we've done major
enhancements to the architecture for our over-the-air
updates, and we have been able to reduce the amount of free
space you need to get to iOS 9 from the 4.6 gigs that
it took to get to iOS 8 down to just 1.3, so we
think everybody is going to be getting to iOS 9. [Applause] So iOS 9, intelligence
throughout the system, Apple Pay, enhancements to
really popular apps like Notes and Maps, an all-new News app,
and incredible features now for iPad with Multitasking
and QuickType, and of course, enhancements to the foundations. Now, iOS 9 is a great release
for our users, but once again, it's a fantastic release
for all of you developers, bringing a ton of new features. You saw search extensibility. We are adding UI
testing to Xcode. [Cheers and applause] Yes! We have a new technology
called App Thinning, which optimizes your
downloads to exactly the subset of resources needed for that
user's device, so you are able to get -- take less
space on device. It's really great. Now, when it comes to gaming,
we've enhanced SpriteKit, SceneKit, and Metal and
introduced three new frameworks, GameplayKit to bring
artificial intelligence with path avoid obstacle
avoidance and path finding; Model I/O to provide
beautiful lighting on your 3D models;
and ReplayKit. It lets you enhance
your applications to let users record their game
play as video and share it. It's really great. [Applause] Now, HealthKit has been on
fire, so we've continued -- well, we added water,
actually, to HealthKit. We are not trying
to put out the fire. We are adding lots of additional
health metrics to be tracked, for instance, hydration,
UV exposure, and reproductive health. Now, HomeKit has been taking off with manufacturers
introducing HomeKit peripherals to the market now in areas like
thermometers, locks, and lights. And now in iOS 9, we
are adding support for window shades,
sensors of all kinds. For instance, carbon monoxide
sensors, motion sensors. And we're adding support for
security systems as well. Perhaps most importantly,
we are allowing you to access your home remotely
and securely via iCloud. So no matter where you
are, you can control all of your HomeKit devices. [Applause] Next, CarPlay. So CarPlay supports audio
apps and now, in iOS 9, it also supports apps by the
automaker to control things in your own car without
leaving the CarPlay experience. And CarPlay is supporting
more kinds of screens, wider aspect ratios, high DPI. But most significantly
with CarPlay, we are pulling the cord. In future cars, you will
be able to get in your car without taking your phone out of
your bag or out of your pocket and start experiencing
CarPlay effortlessly. It's going to be really great. [Applause] Finally, let's talk about Swift. [Cheers and applause] You all know that the growth that Swift has been experiencing
is just unprecedented, and we've all seen
it with the flood of applications coming
in to the App Store. Well, now we are stepping on
the gas this year with Swift 2. Now, Swift was designed from
the beginning to be fast, and we've continued to roll out targeted optimizations all
year long, and now with Swift 2, we have an all-new optimization
technology that's especially great for complex applications
and object-oriented programming that we call Whole
Module Optimization, and the results are
really fantastic. In addition, we are bringing
the language features that you've asked for most, an elegant new error
handling model, the ability to see
your interfaces as synthesized headers
in Xcode, and the feature that Tim has been begging for
all year, protocol extensions. You are all going to love it. Now, we think Swift is the
next big programming language, the one that we will
all be doing application and systems programming
on for 20 years to come. And we think Swift should be
everywhere and used by everyone, and so we're going to be
doing something really big. Today we are announcing that
Swift will be open source. [Cheers and applause] We will be rolling
out the compiler and the standard libraries
for iOS, OS X, and Linux. And it will all be out there
by the end of the year. So that's Swift,
and that is iOS 9. We are doing a developer
beta -- you guessed it -- today, and for the first
time for a major iOS release, a public beta, so sign
up now at beta.apple.com, and you can get the beta
when it comes out in July. And of course, we
will be rolling it out as a free upgrade
in the fall. And iOS 9 will support
all of the devices that were supported by iOS 8. We are not dropping
any this year because we want everyone
to get iOS 9. [Applause] That's iOS 9. I really appreciate your time. Have a fantastic conference. Thank you. [Cheers and applause] >> TIM COOK: Thanks,
Craig. iOS just keeps getting better
and better for our many hundreds of millions of users,
and iOS 9 takes it to an even greater level
with incredible new apps and intelligence
built right into iOS. And as an avid iPad user, I
am also incredibly excited about how far it extends the
iPad experience as we continue to lead in the post-PC era. With El Capitan, we've
created a new version of OS X that dramatically
improves the experience and the user experience and the
performance of the Macintosh. And of course, Swift. You've just heard Swift provides
a single language for you to create apps for
both OS X and iOS. There's really so many
possibilities for you to use these platforms
and these tools to create unbelievable apps
that will impact business and healthcare and education and
really everything in our lives. There's seemingly no
limit to what you can do. And of course, underpinning
this, the App Store is very key. It's hard to believe that the
App Store was launched only seven years ago. It's hard to remember
a day without it. Now, I'm happy to announce that the App Store recently
passed a major milestone. The App Store has passed
100 billion apps downloads. [Applause] The rate of growth
and the momentum is absolutely staggering. The industry has never seen
anything like this before. The App Store has
forever changed software and software distribution. And it's also been
an economic boon. We've now paid over $30
billion to developers. [Applause] The App Store continues to be the most profitable app
marketplace on the planet. Now, we could not be more proud
of the work that you are doing. More and more, developers
are transforming, empowering, and reimagining the
very important things that we do in our daily lives. We've made a video about
your incredible impact and just how far you've come
in such a short period of time, and I'd love to run
it for you now. >> Eight years ago, when
the iPhone was launched, it didn't have an App Store. And there was tremendous desire
on the part of developers and customers for Apple to let third-party
applications be created. We all had this dream
that apps were going to become really important,
but it took some time to realize how they would affect
everything that we care about, and as that cumulative effect
appeared, then we all start to realize, oh, my
goodness, this is bigger than any of us imagined. >> Apps plus handheld
devices, I think that's a watershed
moment in civilization. I put it up there
with the invention of the microscope
and the telescope. We live in a time where the most
powerful tools ever imagined to investigate and probe
our world are in the hand of essentially everyone. >> If you think the Industrial
Revolution was transformational, the App Store is way bigger. I don't think we've seen
anything reach a mass adoption at anything close to this pace. It took, for example,
electricity over a hundred years to get to its first
50 million users. It took television 13
years, and the App Store got to 50 million users
in only 17 months. >> The thing the App
Store did was give each and every developer a voice. It's a testament that two
guys in a room working on an idea can launch an app
and instantly have hundreds of millions of people
very quickly. The iPhone made photography
universally accessible. >> I cannot think
of a single industry that doesn't need an app. People want data at
their fingertips. They want personalized
experiences. They want power over
their money. And it's not just for banking;
it's for every industry. The App Store has fundamentally
shifted how we all need to deliver. It's leveling the playing field. >> We don't have to own
things. We don't have to
own our own cars. We don't have to
own our own music. We can call it up
when we need it. That's a big change, all
flowing from the idea of not just convenience
but people building up an infrastructure
around that. We are now talking
not about hundreds of people getting the benefits
of an idea, but millions. >> If you had told me when I
was a kid that you would be able to write an idea and then film
that idea and then distribute it to the world on a device
that you could also put in your pocket, I would
never have stopped laughing, and I would have
thought you were insane. The App Store gives
everyone access to incredibly powerful tools, and there's an incredible
generation of filmmakers and storytellers to come. >> Kids love technology,
and they love interacting with the iPad and with apps. That wonder and awe that gets
ignited is actually being utilized to help
that person learn. Certainly in education
there's so much potential to take the classroom
with you anywhere. >> We all know we are
in this magic moment. There are so many incredible
apps, and they do things for people that change
their lives. >> Music for me,
it's like everything. It's really special. This amazing feeling that
music gives me, I want everyone to have that, even if
the person cannot hear. So the idea of the app is to
introduce music for deaf people. I am going to put these on
your wrist, so if you play, you can feel the vibrations. >> I can
feel it. >> Did you feel
that, Rob? My dream is to bring
music to everyone. >> It is an amazing
time to be a developer. We are still just at the
beginning of all this, this moment where the technology
of an iPhone and an iPad and the Watch enable so
many incredible things. There's so much that can
still change and evolve due to the power of applications. [Music] [Applause] >> TIM COOK: On behalf
of everyone at Apple, we want to thank the
developer community for everything that you've done. Thank you. [Applause] You have changed so many
parts of all of our lives and transformed the
world in the process. Now, we want to talk about
now the next opportunity to transform the world. And that's the opportunity to
bring native apps to the Watch with a new version of watchOS. [Applause] For us, this is a giant moment. This is how we felt when
we launched the App Store. Opening a new platform
to developers to create new applications that can really change
people's lives. We really believe
deeply in this space. We believe in technology
designed for the wrist. And we believe by
opening up the platform that you will create
new and powerful uses that today we can
only begin to imagine. We began making the Apple Watch
available just six weeks ago, and it's pretty amazing that
today we're already talking about the next version
of the watchOS. This new version will have
great new capabilities, and it will bring native
apps right to your wrist. To tell you all about it, I'd
like to invite up my friend and colleague Kevin Lynch. Kevin. [Cheers and applause] >> KEVIN
LYNCH: Hi. So we're moving really fast on
watchOS, and I am super excited to talk with you about the
enhancements that are coming in watchOS, as well as the powerful new
abilities for app development. Let's start with
the enhancements. The enhancements include
great new Timepiece functions, improvements in communication
as well as in Health & Fitness, and support for the
new capabilities in Apple Pay, Maps, and Siri. Let's start with Timepiece. Now, already, Apple Watch
is a really great timepiece, the most customizable one in the
world, and a lot of that is due to the Watch faces and
how you can change them. We are adding some new
Watch faces in watchOS 2. That includes a beautiful
new Photos face to be able to select any photo you have and
create a Watch face out of it. You can create more than one and
switch between them as you like. Or you can select a photo album, and every time you
raise your wrist, you will see a different
photo from your album show up. It's a great way of seeing
your photos throughout the day. We went a little
further with this, and we shot some
photos ourselves. We did some time-lapse
photography in some beautiful
locations around the world. The way this works is
when you raise your wrist, you will see this
24-hour shoot we have done in different locations, and it
will be the current time there. If it's in noon, you
will see noon in London. If it's night, you'll
see Big Ben all lit up. We've done this not
only for London, but some other locations too. You can choose from
Hong Kong, Mack Lake -- which a beautiful
place in the Sierras -- as well as New York,
Shanghai, and London. It's a great way to see really
beautiful imagery, both your own and these time-lapse
images, on your wrist. You can customize your
Watch with these images but you can also choose to
show the information that you like on your Watch
face with something in traditional Watch terms
that's called Complications. With watchOS 2, we are really
excited to enable app developers to make your own Complications. [Applause] So be able to do things
like show your flight time from United, see the state
of your home control system, look at the charge level
of your electric car, or see sports scores, for
example, from the MLB app. You can choose the
information that you most like to see right
on your Watch face. It's going to be
really, really cool. And this will work not
only on the modular face but across the others that
support Complications as well. You will be able to choose
from a variety of templates, and we'll make those
look beautiful in each of the different Watch faces. So it's going to be
a really fast way to look at this information. Now, we went further than this. We thought it's really
great to be able to see the current information, but what about future
information, like the weather later
today or your meeting after the current one? And what if you could go
forward in time and actually see that information update
on your Watch face? Well, we are supporting
that in watchOS 2 with something we
call Time Travel. And you will be able to
rotate your Digital Crown, and you can go both forward
and backward through time, and the information will
update right on your screen. Let's take a look here. So I've got my meeting in
the middle there and weather and the charge level of
the car and time in London. When I rotate the Crown, you
can see it's changing the time and showing me things
that are coming up. Now, we know a really popular
one here might be the stocks Complication, but we
haven't cracked that one yet. We are working on it. You can keep rotating,
keep going forward, get all the way to tonight. You can see I have a date
night tonight, weather is going to be good, time in London will
be 2:00 a.m. You can see all the information you like to see in
the time you want to look at it. Really, really fun
way to interact with time on your Watch. That's Time Travel. [Applause] Now, we also thought, What
would be a great experience for the Watch when it's on
your nightstand and charging? Well, we've come up with a
new user interface for this in watchOS 2 called
Nightstand Mode. When you put your Watch on
its side and it's charging, you will get this beautiful
display now of the time, and of course, you can set
an alarm that will wake you up in the morning, and it
will go something like this. [Alarm tone] So a beautiful little
bedside alarm clock now with Apple Watch, and
the buttons on the side and the Crown act as your
Snooze and your Off button. A really fun way to have a
Nightstand view on your Watch. Those are some of the great
new Timepiece functions that are coming in watchOS 2. Let's look at communication. Now, already Apple
Watch is great at communicating
with your friends. You can just press the side
button and see your 12 friends that you have selected. Now, we realize that some of
you have more than 12 friends, so now in watchOS 2, you
can have different sets of friends you can select,
and you can add a friend right from your Watch by
pressing the plus sign and add a friend right there. Isn't that cool? [Applause] Now, when you are
communicating with someone, you can make a phone call or
send a message or send a drawing with Digital Touch, and now
in watchOS 2, you will be able to use multiple colors
in your drawings, so you can draw a
beautiful flower that has more than
just one color. Even my drawings are starting
to look better now with this. Also an email. You can already read
email on your Watch. With watchOS 2, you will
be able to reply to email. [Applause] And with the phone, you can
already take phone calls on your Watch. We are now going to
support FaceTime Audio, so you will get really
high-fidelity calls right on your wrist. [Applause] And with Health & Fitness, already Apple Watch is a great
partner for Health & Fitness. With watchOS 2, we are enabling
your favorite fitness apps to run natively on the Watch so you can use them wherever
you are, and your workouts with these apps will
contribute directly to your all-day activity,
which will be really great, so if you go on a bike
ride, it will count. [Applause] We are also enabling
Siri to start workouts, so you can just raise your
wrist and say, hey, Siri, start a 30-minute
run in the park, and it will start the Workout
app and get it going for you. You can also say things like
"go for a 300-calorie bike ride" or "go for a 5-mile run, "
and it will start the workout for you without having to
touch the watch at all. When you achieve something, there are some beautiful new
achievements you will see that look like this. They spin right in, they're
beautiful, you can play with them in 3D on the
Watch, they are engraved on the back now with your
name, and you can share these with people over Messages,
Facebook, or Twitter. Really cool Health &
Fitness. [Applause] With Apple Pay, you saw some of the great new
support we are bringing for store cards and
rewards cards. We are supporting
that in the Watch, so you can select a store card
and use it right in your Watch in a merchant terminal
just by waving it at the store stand there. And with Wallet coming to Watch, all of your rewards cards
will be right there, and you can also use those
right from your Watch as you are doing purchases. With Transit, we are
supporting, of course, the mass transit capabilities
in Maps now, so you will be able to see the transit
lines on your wrist. You can actually see
the departure times for different stations
you are near. When you are navigating, you
will get step-by-step directions about getting through the
different mass transit you use. With Siri, we are continuing
to add new domains for Siri. In watchOS 2, we
are enabling Siri to get you mass transit
directions, like bus directions to the Ferry Building,
which will look like this and you can just
start navigating. Or you can control things
in your home with Siri, you can say things like "hey
Siri set the dinner scene," and it will talk to any
HomeKit-enabled devices in your house and set the
lights just how you want them. Isn't that cool? It's going to be great. [Applause] Another great thing is you
can actually ask for any of the Glances you have,
so you can say "hey, Siri, show me the Instagram
Glance," and it will show up right on your Watch face. This could be a glance you
don't have currently selected. It's a great way
to show information from third-party apps
right there in Siri. So those are just
some of the highlights of what's coming in watchOS 2. We think it's going
to be a really, really great update
to the Watch. Now, that's not all. [Applause] We also, of course, focused on
what we can do for developers, and already, out of the gate
on day one, you can build apps for Apple Watch using
something called WatchKit, and that has enabled many
thousands of apps now to be created for Apple Watch,
and these apps today function by relying on your phone. So you might have, for
example, an app on your Watch and the user interface
runs on your phone and the user interface is on
your Watch, but all the logic for your app today
runs on your phone. With native apps, you will
be able to move that logic to the watch so both the
UI and the logic are there, it will all run locally,
performance will be great, responsiveness will be great, it's going to be a great new
frontier for apps on Apple Watch with native app support. [Applause] When you are actually wandering
away from your phone sometimes, your apps will be able
to communicate directly with the network with
known Wi-Fi networks, so you can get the information
you want wherever you are with your Watch. [Applause] So we heard from you as we
were working on native apps, a lot of feature requests
of things you would like to do on the Watch. These are a bunch of the
things that we've heard. So we've been listening to that. Let's go through
some of the things that will be possible
now in watchOS 2. You can see how we did on this. So one of the things we
heard was really wanted to access the microphone
on the Watch. So yes, in watchOS 2, you can
access the microphone right on the Watch and bring that
audio right into your app. [Applause] We also heard you want to
play audio out of the speaker. You can do that. WatchOS 2 with native
apps, you can play back through the Watch speaker
or you can play audio to a Bluetooth headset
or speaker connected, both short-form and
long-form audio. Video. We know you
wanted to play video. You can play back short-form
video right on the Watch face. It looks beautiful
on the Watch display. Access to HealthKit. We definitely heard that. You now will have access,
native HealthKit on the watch, including streaming heart rate
data, so if you are doing, for example, a bike
ride with Strava, you can see what heart rate zone
you are in while you are biking. [Applause] HomeKit is natively on the Watch
so you will be able to talk to your HomeKit devices from
your Watch and control them. We think this is going
to be a great future for control right
from your wrist. You will be able to
access the Accelerometer so you can get movement data. So for example, from the iPING
golf app here, you can check out your golf swing tempo as you are swinging the golf
club with your Watch on. Taptic Engine is one of the
things we've really done a lot of focused work on to make it a
great experience on the wrist. We are bringing access to
the Taptic Engine for you for your app development. You will be able to choose from
a range of different feelings as well as audio that
will come out the speaker. So for example, if I am
unlocking my car here, I will get feedback on my
wrist, both audio and felt. Just like that. Another great interaction on the
Watch is using the Digital Crown to manipulate the UI, and we are
enabling access to Digital Crown as well with watchOS 2. You will be able to
control custom UI element like changing the
temperature here just by rotating the Crown like this. Super easy way to
interact with your Watch. [Applause] So we've done a great job
bringing a lot of access to the Watch now
with native apps. I would like to show you a
demo now with some examples. [Applause] So I've got a Watch here,
and I am going to put it on. It's connected to the display
here through this little cable. All right. Let's start by looking at
three examples of new features in watchOS 2, then I
will show you three apps. Let's start with
making a photo face, so I will press my Digital Crown
here, go to the Home screen. There's my Photos. You can see I've got a
bunch of photos on here. I can zoom in with
the Crown, pan around, and I can pick a photo that might make a nice
Watch face like that one. I want to zoom in and
crop it a little more. I am going to zoom in a
little more, move it over like that to get it just right. I think that's going to
make a great Watch face, so I just Force Touch,
choose Create Watch Face, and there you go, a
beautiful new Watch face. [Applause] Let's look at Time Travel. I will go over to
my modular face, got some more information here. I have flight times
here on United. I can see the temperature, my VW car's charge
level, and time in London. So I just rotate the Crown
here, I can go forward in time. Time is updating. My flight is leaving,
you can see, at 1:45. I wonder if my charge level will
be enough to get to the airport. So if I keep going forward in
time here, we will get to 1:45, and you can see my charge
level is just going to be great to get to the airport. In fact, you can keep going
and look at boarding time and arrival time
for your flight. So you can get a great
preview of your day just by rotating the Crown
right on the Watch face. It's a lot of fun. Just press the Crown
and go back to Home. If you get an email, you can
reply to email now in watchOS 2. Here is an email that's
just come in from Marc. I can reply to this by pressing
the button right below the message, or you can
use Siri to reply to a message right
from a notification. If I just use Siri here,
I can reply like this. Reply: I would love to. So Siri is making
the message there. It's created a response. I just press Send, and
it now goes off to Marc. So just by pressing the
Crown, you can use Siri to send a message
right from your wrist. Now, let's look at a
few third-party apps. Let's look at the VW app you
saw on slides a second ago. I will show you how that works. Here it is. Now, I can lock my car just by pressing this
control right here. It responds right away. You can see the app also
opened very quickly. And I can control
the temperature here that we were looking at before
by just rotating the Crown. You can see how responsive
it is as I go up and down through temperatures here. Really, really cool. I will get it nice and warm for
me so when I get down there, it will be nice and toasty. Okay. Turn it on. All right. I've got confirmation
that it actually enabled that on my car now. Access to the mic is going
to be really helpful in apps, and some of the apps that will
really benefit are communication apps like We Chat. A lot of messages sent via
WeChat are audio messages, so let's see how that
will work with watchOS 2. I have a message from Becky. I can reply by pressing
the Reply button, and you can see I've
got a microphone now so I can do an audio response. Let's do that. That sounds great. You can see as I was recording
it, it got the audio levels of my voice and now
it sent that to Becky. I can also reply
with stickers here. There's different
categories of them. With the Digital Crown now
being able to connect to the UI, I can flip through recent
stickers, pick one quickly that I like, and just
send that one as well. So very fast to interact now with all these new controls you
have available in watchOS 2. Now, let's look at
the Vine glance. Vine is a great example of
playing back video on the Watch, and its format is really
perfect for the Watch face. Here is a recent one on Vine. So that's video playing back
right on the Watch face. So those are just some
examples of what you can do now with watchOS 2, and
I am super excited to see what all you guys
do with all this stuff. [Applause] So some great new
enhancements coming, as well as some super powerful
app development tools for you. And we've been working
really hard on this, and I am really happy to say
that this stuff is all available to you today to start
building these native apps. [Applause] Just six weeks from our
launch, it's unbelievable. Then it will be available
in the fall to everyone, and we will work
across all the watches, of course, and it will be free. So this has been
a great adventure. We are just getting
started here, and I am really looking forward
to the journey ahead with all of you on Apple Watch. Thank you very much. Back to Tim. [Applause] Thank you, Tim. >> TIM COOK: Thanks,
Kevin. We're really excited to have
Apple Watch out in the world, and we can't wait to see
what you do with watchOS. And we couldn't be more
excited about how developers and users will use the powerful
ecosystems of both products and platforms, three
amazing platforms. The opportunities
really are limitless. Now, before we close this
morning, we do have ... one more thing. [Cheers and applause] I'd like to tell
you about something that we've been working
really hard on and something we are
super excited about. You know, we love music, and
music is such an important part of our lives and our culture. We've had a long relationship
with music at Apple, and music has had a very
rich history of change, some of which we've
played a part in. We've made a great video
about the history of music, and I would like to play
it for you this morning. [Music] [Cheers and applause] >> TIM COOK: Today we're
announcing Apple Music, the next chapter in music, and
I know you are going to love it. It will change the way that
you experience music forever. To tell you more about it,
I'd like to bring up someone who knows more about music and the music experience
than anyone I know. He's worked with amazing
artists from Bruce Springsteen to John Lennon and
countless others. We are thrilled to have him
a part of the Apple team. Please join me in
welcoming Jimmy Iovine. Jimmy. [Cheers and applause] >> JIMMY IOVINE:
Thanks, Tim. Well, it's really
an honor to be here. I'm here because in 2003, the record industry was
a ball of confusion. We had Napster, we had
LimeWire, we had BitTorrent. This giant invader from
the north, technology. I'm looking at my guys saying,
well, what do we do with this? So I go up to Apple, and I
see Steve Jobs and Eddy Cue, and they showed me something
brilliant and groundbreaking, a simple, elegant way to
buy music online, iTunes. I'm like, wow, the ads are real. These guys really
do think different. [Laughter] So they could help
move culture the same way that art moves culture. Technology and art can work
together, at least at Apple. So now 2015, music industry
is a fragmented mess. If you want to stream
music, you can go over here. If you want to stream
some video, you can check some
of these places out. If you want to follow
some artist, there's more confusion for that. So I reached out to Tim Cook
and Eddy Cue, and I said guys, can we build a bigger and better
ecosystem with the elegance and simplicity that
only Apple can do? One complete thought
around music. And from that, I'm
standing here today so proud of everyone that's worked
so hard, and I am going to introduce you to Apple Music. [Applause] >> Music has such
power in our lives. The way we listen to and experience music is
undergoing a profound change these days. To have access to nearly
all the music in the world at our fingertips and in
our pockets is remarkable. And yet there needs
to be a place where music can be treated
less like digital bits and more like the art it is, with a sense of respect
and discovery. And if that place could
actually accommodate and support the artists
who make the music, not just the top-tier artists, but the kids in their
bedrooms too, provide them all with a home and a way to
engage with their audiences, that would be pretty great. And that's what we set out
to do with Apple Music. [Music] >> On Apple Music, all the
ways you love music can now live together. Stream from the millions
of songs on iTunes any time and on demand, along with
hand-picked playlists, recommendations,
and all that's great and breaking in music right now. And broadcasting every day is
Apple's first 24/7 worldwide radio station, live
in over 100 countries, Beats 1 is anchored
by Zane Lowe in LA. Ero Dodden in New York. >> New York City
worldwide, this is Beats 1. >> And me, Julie out of
London. >> We cannot wait to play you
guys music we've got lined up. >> And at the heart of Apple
Music, there's Connect, where artists can share
with fans like never before. Songs, remixes, demos,
mix tapes, photos, videos, lyrics, soundbites. Really, any way an artist
chooses to express themselves. >> TRENT REZNOR:
For fans, we tried to create a
complete experience, by combining the catalog
of the world's music with the music that's
not in that catalog yet, direct from the artist to you in a shared experience
with Beats 1. For the artists, we've built
an ecosystem we hope can start to provide the tools to grow,
nurture, and sustain careers. One place, one complete
thought around music. [Music] [Cheers and applause] >> JIMMY IOVINE:
Thank you. That's Apple Music and
the great Trent Reznor. It's all the ways you love
music all in one place. And that place is
almost in a billion hands around the world already. One app, one single
app on your iPhone. Apple Music is three things. It's a revolutionary
music service. Oh. A revolutionary
music service curated by the leading music experts
who we helped hand-pick. These people are
going to help you with the most difficult
question in music. When you are listening to a
playlist, what song comes next? The only song that's
as important as the one you are
listening to at that moment is the
one that follows it. Now, picture this. You are in a special moment. You're exercising or some
other special moment. [Laughter] Right, Dre? He exercises a lot. And your heart's pumping. And you are about
to turn up the reps. And the next song
comes on, ehhh! Buzz kill. You may ask why that happened. It happened because it
was probably programmed by an algorithm alone. Algorithms alone can't
do that emotional task. You need a human touch, and
that's why at Apple Music, we want to give you the right
song, the right playlist, at the right moment,
all on demand. Now, the first-ever live
24-hour worldwide radio station, so Trent Reznor calls
me up and says I got it. This is what we're going to do. Let's build the first-ever
worldwide live radio station broadcast from three cities
that plays music not based on research, not based on
genre, not based on drum beats, only music that is
great and feels great. A station that has only
one master, music itself. So I said why do artists
always have the greatest ideas that are practically
impossible to execute? So I said, well, wait a second. That's why we are at Apple. We are at Apple to help
artists' dreams be realized. So we built the station, and
it's a music lover's dream. If you love great music without
any restrictions, you are going to love Apple Music's Beats 1. Finally, Connect, a fantastic
way for established and new and even unsigned artists
to connect directly with music lovers anywhere. This is going to be very
powerful for musicians. Can you imagine being
an up-and-coming artist and being able to
share your music on the biggest music
platform on the world that people already
have, Apple Music? Remember, this is an ecosystem. It's built to fit together. It feeds off each other. When you upload your music to Apple Music, anything
can happen. So now let me leave
the real heavy lifting to my great friend, Eddy Cue, and tell you how this
all works together. [Cheers and applause] >> EDDY CUE: Thank you,
Jimmy. It's great to be here
this morning with you. So Apple Music, it's a
revolutionary music service, and it starts with My Music. We've added some great new
features from iTunes like the Up Next queue, and also
your recently added albums and songs right across the top. And all of the music
you've purchased, along with the playlists
you've created on your Mac or your iPhone, are right here. Now, of course, you can
search your music library, but now you can search and
stream the millions and millions of songs that we have on iTunes. Now, in addition to My Music,
when you can stream and listen to any song you want, you
need a great place to start, and that's why we've
created For You. For You recommends
playlists and albums that we think you
are going to love. They are personalized
to your taste based on the music you listen
to, the artists you love. And it isn't just algorithms. It's recommendations made by
real people who love music, and they are our
team of experts. Now, let's take a look at New. Here you will discover new
artists and albums every week, along with the top charts, and
every one of our playlists, all human-curated, available
by genre or by activity. So when you think
of Apple Music, it's My Music, For You and New. It makes it fun and easy to experience the catalog
of the world's music. And that is the revolutionary
music service. Now let's talk about Radio. The truth is Internet
radio isn't really radio. It's just a playlist of songs. And so we wanted to do
something really big. We wanted to create a worldwide
live radio station broadcasting around the globe, and we've
done that with Beats 1. It's the world's best radio
station now meets the world's best voice, and that's
why we've hired Zane Lowe. Zane is a masterful interviewer
and an influential music figure in his own right, and to tell
you more about it, here is Zane. >> ZANE LOWE: I am a
music fan. I play records. What I love is watching
a group of people react to a great record
for the first time. When I play that record on the
radio, the audience tell me, the time lines light up, my friends tell me,
my phone lights up. They love it or they hate it. But it creates a debate. That's what good music
on the radio does. When Apple first asked me to be
involved in this, they told us to put the great music in front
of the average, the unexpected, the undiscovered, the
anticipated, the underrated. Their words: Move the needle. And that's what we are doing. We have real music fans
running this place. We have great music DJs and
incredible artists who are in the studio right now
building real radio shows that are going to
blow your mind. And the only place that can
pull off an imaginative idea as big as this -- Apple. We are called Beats 1. We are always on, playing
the music that we love. [Applause] >> EDDY CUE: So
Beats 1. It is worldwide, it is live,
it is broadcasting 24 by 7, and it is coming
from New York, LA, and London, and that is Radio. Next, we wanted to find a
way to bring fans closer to the artists they love,
and we call it Connect. It's a place where artists are
free to upload their music, their videos, their photos,
all directly to a fan. Let's take Pharrell, a favorite
musician and songwriter of mine. He is prolific, and
he does a lot. Let me show you how
it works with Connect. He takes a lot of photos. He writes a lot of lyrics. He's experimenting and
mixing songs all the time. Or he just has something
new and interesting to say. All of this lives
right in Connect. Artists can post and
publish and upload anything, including directly to Facebook,
Twitter, and their own website, and fans can like and
comment on those posts. And it's not just for one
artist, but it's for all of the artists that you love. And to give you a
little sense of what it's like to be an artist on Connect, I'd like to invite
up a friend, Drake. [Cheers and applause] >> DRAKE:
Thank you. I want to say, honestly, what an
honor it is to be in this room with so many individuals
that have changed the way in which the world
relates to technology, so give yourselves a
round of applause, please. [Applause] For example, I bought this
vintage Apple employee's jacket using a tool known in the
rap world as the Internet. It's going to be huge this year. It's out of this world. He is excited, he knows about
it, that guy right there. [Laughter] Honestly, in all
seriousness, I came here today to share my story, about the
way technology changed what I do for a living. I am from Toronto, Canada. [Cheers and applause] [Laughter] You know, as a kid growing up,
I always wondered if my city or even my country would
have somebody break into the global music
scene as a true superstar. You know, the dream seemed
unattainable at the time. Even myself, I tried to
do it the traditional way, the towering New York label
buildings, the lobby littered with other people's
accomplishments. It's improbable to think that
every talented artist is going to get a shot to have
their vision validated. And then that's when
the game changed. And we had to change it. Myself and my team
brought our vision and our music directly
to the people. And that was kind of the first
time that we really got noticed. The dream of being a new artist
like myself five years ago and connecting directly with
an audience has never been more close and reachable
than right now. See, now we encourage you to
spend the time on your body of work, spend the time on your
craft, assemble the right body of work, and instead of
having to post your stuff on all these different and
sometimes confusing places, it all lives in one very simple, very easy place,
and that is Connect. It's right from where
you are in your city in front of your computer. And this approach is
how we broke in 2008, and it has been perfected
and simplified, of course, by the great people at Apple. So you know, as I'm working
tirelessly on this next album, this comes at the
perfect time for me. Given the great success of my
last mix tape that went directly to iTunes, this really -- I can't wait to incorporate
Apple Music and especially Connect
into what I am doing next. I am really excited about
what I am working on. And as an artist, I can say for
all those kids sitting at home, it's truly amazing to be part
of something that I believe in, and this is something
that simplifies everything for the modern musician
like myself and the modern music
consumer like you. So I hope you enjoy Apple Music. I hope you enjoy Connect. My name is Drake, and
thank you for your time. Appreciate it. [Cheers and applause] >> EDDY CUE: Thank you,
Drake. And that is Connect. Now, I'd love to give you
a demo of Apple Music, but before I start, I do want to wish Phil Schiller
a happy birthday. [Cheers and applause] So let's go ahead and
launch our new Music app. You will notice right away
it's got a brand-new UI, much simpler to use. Your recently added albums and
songs right across the top. Let's play this new
song from Spoon I added. [Music] One of the things
you will notice, we have a new mini
player across the bottom that always shows
you what's playing. If I tap on it, I
get full screen, and I can see the
beautiful artwork, all the playback controls. I can just swipe down,
and it disappears. Now, I like looking
at my music by artist. It's really easy to do that too. I will just tap on
Albums, switch to Artists, and let's take a look
at Aretha Franklin. The first thing you will notice
is we add beautiful artwork to all the artist pages. Notice as I swipe
up, it goes away, and you see Aretha at the top. No demo goes complete
without playing this song. [Music] Now, you not only get all of
your Aretha Franklin songs in your music library, but
you can also tap on All, and now you can see all of
the songs on Apple Music, including the latest
release, what the top song is, what the top album is. Now, it is hard to stop this
song, but I want to keep going. Now let's go back to my library, and let's take a
look at my playlists. Now, despite the game last
night, I am getting ready for tomorrow night, and I
have already started creating my playlist. One of the first things you will
notice is you can add your own artwork to your playlist. I am going to be
doing this tonight, getting the Warriors
ready, but let's go back. It is karaoke night, and
these are some of the songs that our team has to
look forward to tonight. Let's go ahead and play that. [Music] Just imagine. [Music] Now, if I tap on
the mini player, I can see the full screen. If I tap on the right-hand side
next to the playback controls, I can see the complete
playlist, and it's very easy for me to reorganize it. Let's say I want to
move Jealous back up, and now that will be the
next song that plays. It's that simple. [Applause] Now, that's great. The first time we go to For You,
we want to find out a little bit about your musical
tastes, so we are going to ask you what genres you like. I am a big fan of rock, pop,
hip-hop, and alternative. And now it will ask me for
some artists that I like. Well, I love Bruce Springsteen,
so I am going to tap twice. I like Lorde, like
Alabama Shakes. Now we are going to take all of this information you've
provided, along with all of your playlists and the songs
that you've purchased on iTunes, and we are going to make
recommendations just for you. So here is one inspired
by Bruce Springsteen. Here's one called
Bring the Big Rock. Let's play that. [Music] That's a great Foo
Fighters song. I can just tap and see
the rest of the songs. Definitely going to
like this playlist. Now, here's another
one from Pharrell. I also get new albums
that are available to me, and even some classic albums
that I should be listening to. And so here are some
brand-new albums from the artists
that I really love. Now, here is an interesting
one, a Cuban playlist. You might be wondering
how did that get in there? Well, I like a lot of Latin
music, so Apple Music knows that and is recommending
this playlist to me. Let's take a look at it. [Music] Definitely gets my
Cuban blood going. [Music] Now, this is a playlist I
definitely want to keep, so I am going to tap on the
plus sign, and I've added that now to my playlist. Now, let's take a
look at what's new. You can see new albums
across the top. More here, and even the
hot singles that are out. Let's play this one from
Florence and the Machine. [Music] I can keep scrolling and
see some recent releases. But of course, everyone loves
the charts, so let's go ahead and take a look at the
charts, see the top songs. The top albums. And even the top music videos. We have tens of thousands of
music videos in HD, all ad-free. Let's take a look at this
one from Mark Ronson. [Music] I've got to work on some of
those moves for next year. [Laughter] Now, sometimes
you just want to sit back and let someone else be your
DJ, so let's go to Radio. And to give you a little taste of what Beats 1 is
going to sound like ... >>
Beats 1. Welcome our special guest, Florence from Florence
and the Machine. >> On paper, it sounds like
super, not how you think a rock and roll album would be made. >> Was that you in
your sweatpants? >> That was me in an anorak
cycling to the studio. >> We are looking for the
most exciting music and people that love it in all
corners of the globe, broadcasting to 100 countries. That shared experience
just got so much bigger. &gt;&gt
 LA. >> New York
City. >>
London. >> EDDY CUE: That's
really awesome. Let's take a look at Connect and see what my favorite
artists are up to. Here's Pharrell and some
behind-the-scenes footage. Here is Chris Cornell. This is an interesting one. He has posted lyrics of a new
song that's coming out before, obviously, he's even
recorded it. Here's Bastille. They are working on
their next album. Let's see what they have to say. >> Mark is just through
here, and we are working on a song called Blame, which
some of you might have heard at festivals or gigs before, but we're really excited to
have finally recorded it. It's a song about gangsters. And yeah, this is the riff, which we already
have sounding great. [Music] >> EDDY CUE: It's great to be
able to get behind the scenes and see what the process that
an artist uses to create a song. As we keep going
down, here's a shot from Alabama Shakes
a couple nights ago. And here is a studio session,
actually, at Capital Studio A. Those of you who know,
Capitol Studio is one of the premier studios,
historical, and Alabama Shakes was just
there a couple nights ago. [Music] >> EDDY CUE: Again,
be able to see things you've never
been able to hear or see. Loren Kramar, you probably
have never heard of him. He is an unsigned artist, I
just started following him. He has posted a new song
right up on Connect, and I would love to play it now. First time anyone's heard it. [Music] Just imagine you
are a new artist, and look at all the
people who have been able to hear this song right
now thanks to Connect. [Music] So Loren Kramar. Remember that name. We think he is going to
be really, really huge. Now, of course, you can always
search for music across all of our millions and
millions of songs. I like to do a little
bit of stuff with Siri because Siri has been learning
a lot more about music. Play Born to Run. [Music] It's one of my favorite
songs of all time. Let's get a little
more specific. Play the top ten
songs in Alternative. [Music] If I tap on the Up Next
queue, I can see all of the top ten songs
and what's next. Now, I feel like reminiscing
a little, and let's go back to my high school
days when I graduated. Play the top song from May 1982. [Music] Now, that brings back some
memories, but we will leave that for another time. Have you ever gone to a movie
and you love the soundtrack or the song that was on there,
but you don't know the name or you have forgotten
about it later? Well, it's really
easy with Siri. Play the song from Selma. [Music] Let's do that again. Play the song from Selma. [Music] And that is Siri, and
that is Apple Music. [Cheers and applause] It is a revolutionary
music service with recommendations
just for you, a worldwide live radio station
with the world's best DJs, an exciting way for fans
to connect with artists, and of course, this is joined
by the iTunes Music Store, the best place to buy music. Apple Music is all of
the ways you love music, all in one place. We are launching in over a
hundred countries later this month with iOS 8.4 for your
iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad, as well as a new version
of iTunes for the Mac, a new version of
iTunes for Windows, and Android is coming this fall. [Cheers and applause] Apple Music will be just $9.99
a month, the cost of an album. We want everyone to try it, so we are making the
first three months free. [Applause] Now, we want to do something
really great for families. Today you have to buy
a music subscription for each and every person. Or you share an account even
though you are not supposed to. And now all of you can't
play at the same time, and your playlists and recommendations
get all messed up. Well, with Apple Music, for
just $14.99, you can have up to six family members. [Applause] Everyone gets their own
account, their own library, their own recommendations. It's an incredible value. And that is Apple Music. Thank you. Turn it back to Tim. [Cheers and applause] >> TIM COOK:
Thanks, Eddy. Isn't that amazing? We really love Apple Music,
and we hope that you do too. And we are so excited about it, and with all the countries
we are rolling out to, we made a great ad to
tell the world about it. And I'd love to run
it for you now. >> This is Zane Lowe of
Beats 1. We've got the whole world
locked in for this one. Brand-new Pharrell. [Music] [Cheers and applause] Now, music connects with us all
at such a deep, emotional level. We couldn't be happier
to launch Apple Music, and we can't wait till
you start listening to it at the end of the month. This has been a jam-packed
morning. I hope you've enjoyed
it as much as we have. We want to thank
everybody for joining us, especially the developers,
and I'd like to recognize all of the people in Apple, all
of our team that have worked so hard on making
and creating all of these products
you've seen this morning. Thank you, guys. [Applause] It is an incredible privilege
of a lifetime to work with them. Now, I've got one last thing. Before we go, it's only
fitting to celebrate the launch of Apple Music with an
incredible music performance by one of the hottest new
artists in music today, and it's not only a hot
new artist, but he's going to do a worldwide premiere of
his newest song this morning. Please give it up
for The Weeknd. [Cheers and applause] [ Background Sounds ] [Music] [Cheers and applause] >> TIM COOK: Ladies and
gentlemen, The Weeknd! [Cheers and applause] Everybody have a great week! It's great to be together! [Cheers and applause] ah it's a flippin rabbit hole it's like the challenge is if you get access to the people ask like why it matters i posted a tweet a little while ago complaining that we didn't have a playstation 5 before launch and people were like oh you spoiled piece of crap why why should you get a free playstation when other people have to wait for it and pay for it you should just wait your turn it's like how do i how do i explain this in a way that you can understand i don't want a playstation i don't care i haven't owned a playstation since the playstation 2. it makes it means nothing to me like if i wanted to play a playstation game i would borrow a playstation and play it and then i would not need to own it anymore like it's not the kind of thing that i use regularly the reason that i want a playstation is so i can do my job so i can do it properly so that instead of being put in a position where i am forced to choose between getting way less viewership on the content or phoning in the content and rushing it i don't have to do that if i have access to the hardware early in the case of the playstation would have had happily bought it early if i have access to the hardware early then what it does is it makes it so that i can be well informed on the topic you know being able to talk to sony like hey what are you expecting to be good about this what are you expecting to be not so good about this here's what we found does this jive with what you're seeing in your lab that kind of dialogue is really important to make sure that we've got the correct story for you guys the other thing is well actually yeah that's that's like really really important right the other thing is that we produce video not written articles so we can't just like bang something out yes people people often forget this we can't just bang something out in an afternoon it's actually not an option we have to we have to test it we have to script we have to film it we have to edit it we have to export it we have to upload it we have to make sure it actually all still works i mean we've seen it before you upload a perfectly good video file to youtube and the well it's broken when you go to try and watch it um so that's why it is so important so what happens then is if you don't have access to something early you're put in the position where either you need to release a piece of content that's not as good or you need to release one that's really good so anthony is digging into like everything we're talking uh there's complaints about multi-monitor support um some of reviews have covered this pretty well others didn't touch on it at all but one of the limitations of the m1 silicon max is that you can only have one display connected to one of the thunderbolt ports the other one needs to be on hdmi that's something that's not a game breaker by any stretch of the imagination but it's something people might not realize and it's definitely good to know um what are some of the other little like kind of idiosyncrasies that we've noticed and that are looking into i don't know about that something something i would say as well is like if you you want reviewers to get things early as well because if reviewers get it early they will have more time to hopefully be able to make a better video and if reviewers can make a better video and uh you have more viewers to cross-reference with and hopefully you are able to trust the mass amount of reviewers that you are able to reference um you should be able to make a much more informed purchasing decision which should hopefully be able to either save you money or make you more confident and happy with the purchase that you do make it is directly beneficial and it should help um i would think the majority of the audience watching would be against pre-orders in general um this helps the whole idea of wanting to have something early but not wanting to pre-order it because you can go into the purchase more confidently that way so i don't know it's one of those things where to me it's very confusing when people take the position that we should just take the manufacturer's word for it because how many times has that worked not worked out well for us the funny thing to me and i'll probably get into this in more depth and certainly more eloquently in the mac mini review which i think is going to be the one that comes first the funny thing to me is that apple didn't have to run their presentation that way like i still stand behind everything i said about it it was a really horrible way for them to launch this product for the people that just take everything apple says at face value i guess it was fine because they loved it but for the people that see unlabeled graphs and vague claims about performance it was really discouraging because to me my general experience is that the more confident a manufacturer is the more willing they are to put hard numbers behind their product when they're not confident that's when they start bringing up unlabeled graphs and just kind of being like yeah it's it's way faster six times because i don't know it's just it's funny to me with everything we've seen from m1 so far we would have liked it just fine if they had just said what it actually was if they had just come in and said it's got anywhere from half to 80 percent of the performance on non-native x86 apps i would have been blown away i would have been like that is so cool here if they'd have been like here's some apps and here it is tested you know on a native binary versus an x86 one and it's like yeah anywhere from 50 to 80 i'd have been like wow but then when they come out and they're like 6x the performance my my bs detector goes off hard very hard and it was so unnecessary all they had to say was yeah it's got performance that is competitive with or better than basically any other laptop processor on the market seems like they kind of ignored amd in a big way which i thought was interesting given that amd has better low power mobile processors than intel right now assuming you can find any to buy which is even if they do they're not super mainstream yet yeah well that's because they can't make enough yeah and like but but amd right now amd gaming processors are popping off in the enthusiast space and you are seeing a lot more um like pre-build options with them and whatnot but still if you ask like um some random person that has no interest in computers if you ask them what amd is they probably have no idea if you ask them what intel is they almost certainly know by the way i'm getting feedback on multiple platforms right now that i am notably too loud oh i'm so sorry about that i will fix that for you thank you very much multiple platforms there you go got that all fixed up for you all right so i mean i guess i don't really have anything else to say um a lot of people are expecting me to come out and say i was wrong so far i haven't been wrong about anything yet the one bold prediction that i made um was that apple will drop support for these m1 processor macs sooner than they will for the m2 or whatever they end up calling it sooner than they will for their m2 max and not just by like a year not by like a product release cycle but they will not support them for as long a period of time i could end up being wrong about that but we're gonna have to wait anywhere from three to five to six years in order to find out um everything else that i said i stand behind i've been i have been attacked on many sides for calling the new m1 max and what what did i call them an ipad without a screen and an ipad without a touchscreen and then an ipad with a touch bar or something like that and they're like you don't understand and i'm looking at it going no you don't understand what's wrong with the ipad is the ipad bad so that yeah like are these people just projecting their internal you know hate of the ipad on me on my statement what's wrong with the ipad i mean we've come out and said the only thing missing on the ipad is mac os in review in positive reviews of the ipad most recently our most recent ipad videos the titles are and these actually capture the sentiment of the video i think pretty well in this case sometimes our titles are a little like hey we really need you to click on this so i'll just search for ipads here's our last two videos about the ipad fine the ipad pro is a laptop magic keyboard review from five months ago and also from five months ago we edited this video on an ipad pro those are our last videos about the ipad basically saying the ipad pro is a laptop and by the way it's powerful so when i call the mac mini an ipad without a screen it's not a sick burn it's just it's just a joke like chill the [ __ ] out what is wrong with you you get so defensive people were so mad that i quote unquote used google maps 3d view as a benchmark in my unboxing of the macbook air the new macbook air a it was not a review so many people called it a review do you are you that disconnected you don't even understand what a review is anymore somebody opening a box is not a review lou from unbox therapy does not do reviews it's it's just it's an unboxing it's impressions it's thoughts it's not a review and also what the hell is wrong with google maps 3d view as a way of evaluating quickly and easily if a thin and light is going to chug in basic 3d tasks i've seen it if you have crappy onboard graphics it sucks the pop-in takes forever and it's slow to render [AIR HISSING] [AIR HISSING]

when it comes to staying connected throughout the day our go-to is messages and these days so many of our conversations are inspired through sharing articles photos and more so this year we're introducing great new ways to enjoy all of this amazing shared content and the exchanges that follow here's mindy to show you how it all works thanks craig i'm so excited to show you what's new in messages let's check out my family's conversation everyone's sending me pictures from our fun trip down to joshua tree look at this brand new collage design in this cool stack with even more photos from taylor i can quickly swipe through them tap to view the full bunch and even add a quick tap back now let's see what's going on with my friends they're always sending me all kinds of things like this fun playlist from leah and this mission critical article from casey about what type of pizza is best the thing is the time when i receive this great content is often different than when i'm ready to enjoy it for example i'm not going to read this right now but i'd love to the next time i catch up on the news let me show you something we designed just for that called shared with you so now if i head over to the news app there's a new shared with you section that conveniently surfaces that pizza article and a few from my other friends now that i'm ready to learn more i can take a look and check this out up top it shows me who it's from and i can tap from casey to pick up our conversation and remind her that deep dish is obviously the best kind of pizza and then get right back to browsing so now if i want to check out that playlist leah sent earlier i can head over to apple music and it's right here let's take a listen love it definitely adding this one to my library now one i really love is photos remember those great pictures from my family's trip to joshua tree well over in the photos app the new shared with you section makes it super easy to get back to them they'll also appear in my featured photos and memories and what's really cool is they're automatically brought over to my library too so if i scroll back to that joshua tree trip and drill in you can see all the great photos my cousins sent are right here with the ones i took making my collection so much more complete with zero effort and photos are smart enough to only bring over the ones i actually care about like the ones i was there for so i don't have to worry about screenshots or memes cluttering up my library so that's sharing in ios 15. back to you craig in addition to photos apple music and news we've built shared with you into safari apple podcasts and the apple tv app and if something especially important comes through you can quickly pin it and it'll be elevated and shared with you and places like search so that's messages we shared with you bringing connection to the places you love to enjoy content together [Music] where is it [Music] i can feel the phone vibrating [Music] all right finally finally finally apple has officially announced air tags it's this little puck right here and it's just like a tile tracker for finding your stuff but with a few apple specific differences because apple if you have an iphone like this purple iphone 12 right here look it's a purple iphone the air tags slot right into the apple ecosystem and having played around with this for just a couple of hours i got to tell you this is a very aptly apple gadget here's why so the idea behind air tags is simple enough this little thing here has bluetooth low energy and a u1 ultra wide band chip and it can ring when it's lost so your iphone when you're looking around your house or apartment whatever can point a little arrow at it when you're near to it and then you can make it beat to try and find it it uses apple's find vine network which means that any iphone will be able to locate this thing but only you can actually see its location because all that information is end to end encrypted not even apple can see it plus apple has done some other things to help prevent unwanted tracking which we're going to get into in just a little bit now as far as the hardware design goes i think it's pretty good it's very small which i like but there's no hole here to attach a lanyard or put it on a keychain or whatever to do that you have to buy another accessory so that's one very aptly thing about this apple gadget now apple sells one here there's like 29 bucks or you can get it in leather for 39 bucks and there's a keychain or you can get an hermes one for a lot our med stuff just costs a lot of money but look there's already third-party accessories for as little as 13 bucks and i'm sure even cheaper ones are gonna be coming really soon but still just put a hole on it like right right there anyway the air tag itself is 29 bucks for one or you can get a four pack for 99 bucks but one really interesting thing is the batteries are user replaceable they're cr2032 apple says that they're gonna last about a year but when they conk out you can just replace it yourself that is different from some of the other trackers that are out there that have their batteries built in and non-replaceable user replaceable batteries on an apple product in 2021 who'da thunk so those are the basics but how does it work well it works just like you would expect it to work you pair it to your iphone over bluetooth just like you do with airpods you hold it next to your iphone and a little window pops up and then you can tap it and the thing pairs and associates with your account and then you can give it a name and you're off to the races the air tag just appears inside your find my app with all the other devices and when you want to find it you tap on it tap the button and you look around for it and there it is it just works bing bang boom very aptly okay so first use case let's say that you've lost this thing somewhere inside your apartment you can first of all have this thing make a little beat by hitting a button you can go find it that way and a really interesting part of this is the speaker is actually the plastic dome that's what vibrates to make the noise but say that doesn't work if your iphone supports ultra wide band you can use the fine feature and it'll pop up a little arrow on the screen and you can use that to follow it around when you get close to it your phone actually starts to vibrate a little bit to let you know you're getting closer it's just right there it's really neat now one really appley part of this entire ecosystem is the find mind network it is nearly a billion devices that support it and any one of them can locate one of these air tags but only you can see its actual location because it's all end-to-end encrypted so we're going to try a little experiment viren is going to take one of these things out and he's going to hide it somewhere in the city but he's not going to take his iphone or his apple watch with them so it won't get the location from that one and then we're just gonna go out and see if somebody else's iphone somewhere in the city has located this thing and i'm gonna see if i can find it so you know let's try that did you catch the thing i did the awesome thing it no no oh cool here we go okay i'm on my way to hyde theater's little air tag there's one thing that peter doesn't know and that is that i have um i have gaff tape so i think i'm just gonna tape the air attack to something he cannot easily access let's see how it goes well friends the good buddy varen is somewhere in this city with an air tag on him and nobody with an iphone has seen it all right i think i found a good little spot i'm right up there somewhere we'll see if we can get there i don't know where veerin is i think that'll work so i got a notification a minute ago that the tag was located so i'm walking over to where it was located can't see it now okay see that person right over there that's definitely theater and he's walking to the wrong direction and he's definitely vlogging uh yeah i don't think he could find me my hair tag and viren was spotted by the find my network eight minutes ago somewhere near this address and i'm hoping that means i'm gonna see him real soon because i miss it i miss him a lot getting kind of bored here and all i can think about is food and coffee and deadlines and now i have to edit the video that you're watching right now in like a couple of hours it's gonna be a long night and i still don't have my phone or my watch oh i see him there he is [Music] hi thank you have you been here the whole time yeah i definitely saw you walk over there and take a look if i went up that way yeah it came back i thought maybe because it requires 14.5 to work that only 14.5 iphones would see it so i was terrified of that actually you still haven't found the thing oh so you gotta go find the thing am i am i so it's not it's not on your person no it's not on me okay searching for signal but i'm moving to a different location twelve nine to my left alright i'm going to come clean should i come clean all right i knew you were going to look for it in the ground so i brought it on the tree i brought my gaff tape oh my god are you kidding me where is it it's come on you can get up there [Music] okay let's talk privacy which is another very aptly thing to talk about it always builds extra privacy features into its gadgets first apple is frequently cycling the bluetooth identifier on these little tokens so that they're hard to track by bluetooth beacons or hackers or whatever but the really interesting thing it does is it keeps tabs on whether or not an air tag has been separated from its owner so here's one way that it works if the system detects that air tag happens to be following along with the location of an iphone user that isn't the owner of the iphone that iphone will pop up an alert that says air tag found moving with you you can tap that alert to see the serial number of the air tag and it gives you the option to disable the air tag which you know is just twisting a little thing in the back here to remove the battery bang it's disabled apple also suggests that you could contact law enforcement and law enforcement could work with apple you know if it has the appropriate warrant but since apple can't see the location of any of these air tags itself that's all encrypted the main thing that it can do is check the serial number and see who it's registered to because every air tag has to be registered to an apple user now if you're an android user none of this iphone specific air tag found moving with you alert stuff is gonna work but if the air tag has been separated from its owner and then it starts moving suddenly it will start beeping so you're not completely out of luck with these privacy and safety features all in all i think this privacy and safety stuff is a really thoughtful system and that kind of applies to air tags in general they're small they work with apple's ecosystem and they have a lot of complexity in how they work but all that gets boiled down into something that's hopefully really simple to use really the only non-appley thing here is the fact that the batteries use it replaceable but the rest let's go through it kind of expensive appley and knowing that you might need to buy accessories to make it work well happily privacy focused appley really only works well with apple devices appley nice design overall appley gives itself more features than third-party accessories like tile are going to be able to access very happily and that's air tags it's a very nice appley apple thing for apple users in apple's ecosystem apple hey everybody thanks so much for watching let me know do you like air tags you think you might want a different solution or do you just not care about tracking stuff at all let me know down in the comments and if you're looking for another video we just did one about glass and

that you could join us today. We've got some really exciting
product announcements to share with you. As we all continue to make our way
through these difficult times and face the challenges
that COVID-19 is causing in our communities around the world, it's so inspiring how people everywhere
have adapted: working remotely, learning from home and gathering virtually
to stay close to family and friends. And it's been gratifying to see the important role
our products have played in helping people come together,
carry on and move forward. We know that life
won't always be like this, and we're all looking forward
to better days. Here at Apple, we feel
a deep responsibility to keep innovating, to continue making products that enrich
people's lives in meaningful ways. Today we're focusing on two products that have played integral roles
in people's everyday lives: Apple Watch and iPad. Let's get started with Apple Watch. Apple Watch revolutionized
what a watch can do. If you think about it, for over 100 years, the traditional watch really focused on
just one thing: time. Today, it's incredible
what Apple Watch enables you to do right from your wrist. I use my Apple Watch and
its amazing features throughout the day. Before I go out in the morning,
I check the weather. At work, Apple Watch notifies me with everything from messages
to news alerts and keeps me right on schedule. I'm doing my best to stay in shape, so it's great that Apple Watch
keeps track of my workouts and motivates me to close my rings. When I get home,
I use it to open the garage, unlock my door and turn on the lights. And when I'm ready to settle in, I use Apple Watch
to stream my favorite music. And it's so reassuring
for millions of customers that Apple Watch has introduced
great health features like heart monitoring, cycle tracking
and fall detection and even the ability to take an ECG. No wonder Apple Watch is
the most loved watch in the world. I love reading the many messages
I get every day from Apple Watch users telling me how the watch has changed,
and in some cases, saved their lives. Like Ray from Texas. She'd been experiencing pain
in her stomach, but didn't think it was too serious. When her Apple Watch alerted her
to an elevated heart rate, she realized it really was. She went to the ER, where it was determined
she was in septic shock. Ray got immediate intervention, but she could have died
without that warning from her Apple Watch. Or Enrique from Spain, who's blind and uses his watch
for everything from speaking the time to reminding him when his appointments are to calling taxis and helping him keep fit. For Enrique, his Apple Watch has become
an essential part of his day-to-day life. Now I'd like you to meet a few more
of these people and hear their stories. Dear Apple, my name is Kate. It has always been my dream
to become an Olympian, but that can be hard with type 1 diabetes. It was just so many shots
and finger pricks every single day. I went from having to check my blood sugar
manually every 20 minutes to now all I have to do
is just glance down at my wrist, which reads the insulin pack
attached to my side. [crowd cheering] I feel like I don't have type 1
when I'm competing now. [announcer] That is a US
high-school record. That's unbelievable. My name is YJ. Back in February of 2019, I was diagnosed with high blood pressure
and hypertension. The medications cost me
$2,000 dollars a month, with insurance. That was the tipping point for me. I started tracking my exercises
and started tracking my health, all through my watch. Almost 18 months later,
I am not on any medications, and I am in the best shape of my life. My name is James. We were sitting in the living room, and I glanced down at my watch
'cause it kind of vibrated. It flashed "Increased Heart Rate." By the time we got to the hospital,
my heart rate was 206, and she said,
"Sir, you're going into cardiac arrest." I was 26. I wanted my life, and I didn't want my life just for me,
but I wanted it for my family. I'm thankful to still be here, and I'm thankful for that device
that saved me. I really love hearing those stories about how Apple Watch helps people
and enriches their lives. And healthcare providers,
insurance companies and businesses are also seeing the benefits
of offering Apple Watch. They know it can make a big difference in the lives of their patients,
customers and employees. Recently, the Mount Sinai Health System
in New York launched the new Warrior Watch Study. Using data from Apple Watch, researchers are studying
the impact of COVID on the psychological well-being
of frontline healthcare workers by identifying early signs of stress while also looking to predict infection
before symptoms appear. Singapore has one of the world's leading
healthcare systems. This fall, Singapore will become
the first country to leverage the benefits of Apple Watch by offering incentives for people
to use it to stay healthy and active. Apple Watch helps people understand
so much about their health and fitness and to live a better day. This year we're going to take it
even further. Here's Jeff to tell you what's next. Apple Watch has made a profound impact on so many of our customers' lives,
and we continue to be inspired. And this year, watchOS 7 adds
several important health features that take advantage of
the powerful technology in Apple Watch. The new Sleep app uses
the motion sensors to track your sleep. Automatic handwashing detection recognizes the motion and sound
when washing your hands and encourages you to continue
for the recommended 20 seconds. And watchOS 7 now uses
your motion and heart rate to measure a lower range
of VO2 Max values. Now, the American Heart Association
recommends routinely assessing cardio fitness levels, and VO2 Max is the most accurate way
to capture this. The problem is, it's usually only measured
in specialty clinics. Well, watchOS 7 can now measure
a full range of VO2 Max, which is a powerful predictor
of your overall health. And coming later this year, you can receive a notification if
your VO2 Max drops to those lower levels. Each year, Apple Watch raises the bar, adding new features and technology
that improve our lives. This year, Apple Watch
takes another big leap forward. And I'm excited to show it to you now. This is the new Apple Watch Series 6. The perfect combination of
powerful features and beautiful design. Series 6 is our most colorful lineup ever. There's a new blue aluminum case, this updated
classic gold stainless steel finish, a new gray-black stainless steel
called Graphite and for the first time, a stunning new
Apple Watch (PRODUCT)RED. Now on the inside, Series 6 is
packed with incredible technology, including a new health sensor
that enables an amazing new capability. Let's take a look. With Apple Watch Series 6, you can measure your blood oxygen
right from your wrist. The new health sensor in Series 6 shines red and infrared light
onto your wrist and measures the amount of light
reflected back. Advanced algorithms use this data
to calculate the color of your blood, which indicates
the amount of oxygen present. The new Blood Oxygen app lets you
take a measurement in just 15 seconds. [watch chimes] And Series 6 also captures
periodic background readings and stores them in your Health app. So if you wear your Apple Watch to bed, it can record background measurements
while you sleep. I'll hand it over to Sumbul to talk more about blood oxygen
and its importance to your health. Blood oxygen saturation,
also known as SpO2, is like a vital sign. It's a key measurement that contains critical information about
your breathing and circulation. Apple Watch
is already a powerful health tool, with apps that measure heart rate
and heart rhythm. And now, adding blood oxygen brings another valuable
health measurement to users. Blood oxygen and pulse oximetry are terms that we've heard a lot about
during the COVID pandemic. As you breathe,
your heart and lungs work together to deliver oxygen throughout your body. Blood oxygen saturation is an indication
of how well this system is functioning and of your overall respiratory
and cardiac health. And pulse oximetry is how you measure it. Now, the Blood Oxygen app on Series 6
lets you measure your blood oxygen for fitness and wellness purposes
from your wrist anywhere and at any time. This is a great new tool
for your overall well-being. And to enable future medical discoveries, we're launching three new
health research studies to learn how longitudinal
blood oxygen measurements, along with other health metrics
from Apple Watch, can help manage conditions
that affect the heart and lungs. First, to study how to better manage
and control asthma using physiological signals
from Apple Watch, we're collaborating
with the pulmonary experts at the University of California, Irvine
and Anthem. Second, to learn more about how metrics,
including blood oxygen, can be used to manage heart failure, we're partnering with one of the largest
research organizations in North America, the University Health Network, and the investigators
at the University of Toronto. And finally, as we all continue
to learn more about COVID and understand
the interplay with influenza, we're partnering with the investigators
of the Seattle Flu Study and faculty from the University
of Washington School of Medicine. We will explore how changes
in blood oxygen and heart rate could be early signals of the onset
of these respiratory conditions. So that's the new blood oxygen feature. We're so excited to bring this important
new health capability to our users. Now, back to Jeff to tell you more about
the new Apple Watch Series 6. Whether you're measuring blood oxygen, making a phone call on your watch or simply checking your Activity Rings, it's all made possible by Apple Silicon. Inside Series 6 is our sixth-generation
System in Package. It's a purpose-built design
that's absolutely unique in the industry. It includes a high performance
dual-core processor based on the A13 Bionic in iPhone 11 but optimized for Apple Watch. The S6 is up to 20% faster
than the previous generation. Series 6 also has great new features that are perfect
for when you're out and about. Let's head outside and take a look. Because of its energy-efficient design, Series 6 has an even better
Always-On Display, making it easier to read your watch
on sunny days without having to wake the display. Now it's two-and-a-half times
brighter outdoors when your wrist is down. Series 6 also features
a new always-on altimeter that provides continuous elevation
throughout the day. So on your next hike, you can see your elevation change
in real time, right on your watch face. And at any time, no matter where you are, you can measure
your blood oxygen saturation right from your wrist. [watch chimes] Now let's talk about watch faces. The watch face is fundamental
to the Apple Watch experience. And we're taking faces further this year, starting with some great new designs. And we'd like to share them with you now. [Dye] The watch face is the most powerful
and personal aspect of Apple Watch. Our approach to face design
begins with a deep respect for the history of timekeeping. We combined that sense of craft with the powerful technologies
and capabilities of Apple Watch to create these new faces. The GMT face shows
multiple time zones at once and takes into account where you are. The Count-up face lets you
start tracking elapsed time from any given point. And inspired by classic racing watches, the Chronograph Pro face
features multiple time scales, including a tachymeter to measure speed based on time traveled
over a set distance. In the Typograph face, numerals can be displayed
in three custom type styles and four different scripts. Every combination is tailored
to fit the face perfectly. We also collaborated with
the artist Geoff McFetridge to create a unique piece of art
for your watch. There are millions of combinations, and a different one animates
when you raise your wrist. The Memoji face brings
your favorite Memoji to your watch. Each one moves and reacts to your touch. And with the Stripes face, you can show your pride in who you are,
support your favorite team or even match what you're wearing. We're so proud to add to
the legacy of Apple Watch faces with this new collection. In watchOS 7,
we also gave developers new tools to build even more specialized
watch faces. So if you're into surfing,
there's a watch face for that, with apps like Dawn Patrol
to check surf conditions. Or if you're into photography,
there's a watch face for that, with apps like Lumy
to help you track the sun's position. Or if you're a healthcare provider,
there's a watch face for that, with apps like Notable
to see your upcoming appointments. Watch faces have always been a great way
to personalize your Apple Watch. Another is interchangeable bands. Now, traditional watch bands
have a clasp or a buckle, and they're limited to
a few preset sizes for fit. Well, today we're excited to introduce
something completely different. We call it the Solo Loop. The Solo Loop is remarkably simple. No clasp, no buckle, no overlapping parts. Just one continuous piece. Made from custom liquid silicone, the Solo Loop is stretchable, so you can
easily slip it on and off your wrist. It looks great, and it's durable,
and it's swimproof, so it can go anywhere. It's available in a range of sizes so you can find your most comfortable fit. And it comes in seven fantastic colors. This new band style is so comfortable, we did another version called... the Braided Solo Loop. It's made from 100% recycled yarn that's meticulously braided
with ultrathin silicone threads, and it will be available in five colors. We're also offering a new take
on the leather band with the new Leather Link, with no loop-back or clasp of any kind. There are also great new updates
for Apple Watch Nike, with fun new Sport Band
and Sport Loop colors plus a new Nike watch face. And for Apple Watch Hermès,
we're introducing the new Attelage band, in both single tour... and double tour. That's Apple Watch Series 6, the most advanced Apple Watch ever. We think you're gonna love
all the amazing new features. This year we're doing
two additional things to make Apple Watch available
to even more people. And the first is an entirely new way
for families to use Apple Watch. And here's Deidre
to tell you all about it. Apple Watch is essential
for staying connected to those you love, whether that's a child or an older adult. Right now,
Apple Watch needs to pair with an iPhone, which is something they might not have. This is why we're excited
to introduce Family Setup. With Family Setup, you can use your iPhone
to pair watches for your children or older members in your household
who don't have their own phones. And they will have
their own phone number and account. Let me show you how it works. Family Setup enables greater independence
for your kids or older parents. And you have the comfort of knowing
they're just a call away. You get the safety and communication
features that technology can deliver in a device
that can be managed responsibly. For example, you can specify which contacts
your kids can communicate with when using Messages and more. And you can set up
automatic location notifications. So whether it's Grandma's house,
school or basketball practice... you'll get the reassurance your child is
exactly where you expect them to be. To help them stay active,
kids can now track Move minutes and use all of the other great features
of Activity and Workout in a way that works best for them. Kids can create a Memoji
with just their watch and share it as stickers in Messages
or in the new Memoji watch face. Whether they're learning at home
or in the classroom, the new Schooltime mode
helps kids stay focused with Do Not Disturb,
restricted interaction and this distinctive look, which teachers
or parents can recognize at a glance. These are just some of the ways Family Setup
provides kids and older adults with the powerful and unique
benefits of Apple Watch, even if they don't have an iPhone. Family Setup requires a cellular model
of Apple Watch Series 4 and later and will be available at launch
with these carrier partners... in these regions around the world, with more coming later this year. And that's Family Setup. Back to Jeff. We think Family Setup will
keep families more connected, giving kids
greater independence and agency and you more peace of mind. The second thing we're doing to make Apple Watch available
to even more people is to create a new model that combines
elements of Series 6 design with the most essential features
of Apple Watch, all at a more affordable price. We call it Apple Watch SE. Apple Watch SE has
the features customers love. It has everything you need
to stay connected, be more active
and keep an eye on your health. And like Series 6, Apple Watch SE uses our largest
and most advanced watch display, allowing you to see
so much more at a glance. More information and apps
on your watch face. More in Messages, Calendar and Maps. And larger and easier-to-read metrics
while you're working out. And for fast access
to information and apps, Apple Watch SE uses the S5 chip, for up to two times faster performance
than Series 3. And staying connected is even easier
with the cellular models, which allow you to make phone calls,
send messages and more, even without your phone. And with Family Setup, cellular models of Apple Watch SE
will also be great for kids. Customers love using Apple Watch
for fitness and working out, and Apple Watch SE has
the same accelerometer, gyroscope, compass and altimeter as Series 6. And because it has
the latest motion sensors, Apple Watch SE
also supports fall detection, a feature that's made
a lifesaving difference for many Apple Watch wearers. With all of these features and more, including the new capabilities
in watchOS 7, we think Apple Watch SE will be
the perfect watch for many new customers. Apple Watch SE starts at just $279. In addition, we're announcing
Apple Card Financing for Apple Watch, so customers can easily pay
across 24 monthly payments. Apple Watch Series 6, with the breakthrough
new blood oxygen sensor, starts at just $399. And Series 3 continues
at its great entry price of just $199. With three great Apple Watch models
to choose from, there really is
an Apple Watch for everyone. Now let's talk about what Apple Watch
is doing to protect the environment. Apple's commitment to the environment
spans everything we do, from how we design our products
to the materials that go in them to how they're manufactured. And here's Lisa to share
some of the many things Apple is doing to reduce our environmental footprint. We're proud that all of our corporate
operations worldwide are carbon neutral. And we've done it by replacing
dirty energy with clean renewable power. All of our offices,
retail stores and data centers run on 100% renewable energy. We're also proud that we've cut
our comprehensive carbon footprint by 35% since 2015. And you may have heard we're now taking
our environmental commitment even further, starting with a promise. By 2030, Apple will be 100% carbon neutral for our entire end-to-end footprint, including our supply chain and products. To keep our promise, we're focusing on
not just the energy we use but the materials needed
to make our products. Let's take a look at Apple Watch. Beginning last year,
our aluminum watch cases are made with 100% recycled aluminum. And for Series 6, we're now using 100% recycled rare earth elements
and tungsten in the Taptic Engine. And we go to great lengths to make sure our products
are free of harmful chemicals. Like all of our products, Apple Watch is free of BFR,
PVC, beryllium and mercury, and the display glass
is made without arsenic. And all of the fiber in our packaging
comes from recycled sources or responsibly managed forests. Sometimes, it's not what we make
but what we don't make that counts. We know that customers have been
accumulating USB power adapters, and that producing
millions of unneeded adapters consumes resources
and adds to our carbon footprint. So this year, we are removing
the USB power adapter from Apple Watch. We're also helping
our Apple Watch manufacturing partners transition to renewable energy. That, combined with
removing the power adapter, will result in eliminating
the carbon equivalent of over 50,000 cars
from our roads per year. We have lots more to do,
and we'll have lots more to share in the months and years to come. Now back to Jeff. These actions are significant and lasting, and I'm proud of the great work
Apple is doing to protect our planet. So that's our lineup. Apple Watch Series 6
with the new blood oxygen sensor, the most advanced Apple Watch yet. And the very capable and affordable
Apple Watch SE. You can order both today,
and availability starts this Friday. To celebrate the launch
of the new Apple Watch Series 6, we created a video to show you
just how far the watch has come. And here it is. [woman narrating]
Imagine a future where one day, machine learning will give you
the power to track your sleep. -Imagine--
-[woman] Excuse me, ma'am? [narrator] Yes, can I help you? Yeah, this already does that. [narrator] Oh. I didn't know that. Well, now you do. Okay. Let's try this again.
It's all right. I'll start again. Imagine one day, a tiny device
with an optical sensor will send you an alert
if your heart rate is too low. [woman 2] Psst. Yes? What? -[whispering] It already does that.
-What? Oh. Okay. Well, how about we'll send you
an alert if your heart rate is too high? It already does that. All right. Let's try something new. We'll send you an alert
if you're someplace that's too loud. -[watch chimes]
-I just received one of those alerts. Really? [shouting] Well, you should
probably find a quieter place, sir. You should probably
mind your own business. [groans] Okay. -Imagine one day in the future--
-Hold on. -No, no, no! Let me finish.
-One second. -You'll be able to take an ECG--
-It already does that. "It already does that." -I heard that.
-Good. What about continuously
track your elevation? Does it do that? -Does that.
-Right. Got it. -Does that.
-Thank you. -Does that.
-Yep. Heard it the first time. -Encourages you to stay fit.
-Does that. [watch chimes] Okay. I get it. You're fit. Uh, I don't know.
Will it automatically call 911 if a bear chases you off a cliff
and you take a hard fall? Huh? -Yeah. Already does that.
-Seriously? Yeah. Seriously. You gotta be kidding me. Okay, okay, okay. I got it.
Let's go from the top! Imagine a day, a future-- Imagine a future, one day, tiny device,
blah, blah, blah, that uses red and infrared light
to measure your blood oxygen level. Yes, what? No, no, no, no. Don't you dare say it. -[no audible dialogue]
-I'm sorry. I can't hear you! [watch chimes] Very cute. Well, that was fun. Since the beginning, one of the most profound impacts
Apple Watch has had is helping people be more active. We've been working on something that will motivate and inspire you
even more on your fitness journey. And here's Jay to tell you all about it. Being more active is one of the most
important things we can do for our health. So over the years, we built a range
of features on the Apple Watch designed to motivate
a wide variety of users. We hear from people
who've become healthier just by closing their Activity Rings
each day and friends and family
who are able to motivate each other and stay connected even from far away
with Activity Sharing. And then there are our most competitive
Apple Watch users, who love earning awards
and challenging each other to get fit. One of the Apple Watch's most popular apps
is the Workout app, which has been finely tuned
with powerful algorithms that accurately track
the most important metrics for all the workouts you do. This year we wanted to push the Apple Watch workout experience
even further, so we're creating amazing workouts
with incredible music, delivered by the world's best trainers. This is the first fitness service
built around Apple Watch. And we'd like to show it to you now. ["Go Time" by TYPO.S playing] Workout, trainer, time, music. [breathing heavily] You're halfway! -Workout.
-Trainer. -Time.
-Music. -Love it!
-Nice work! -You did great!
-See you tomorrow. [man] Workout. Trainer. Thank you for sweating out with us. [man] Time. Music. Introducing Apple Fitness+, a new service for Apple Watch designed
to inspire you to get fit and stay fit. The entire Fitness+ experience
is powered by the Apple Watch in some really cool ways. Let's take a look at how it works. Apple Watch owners love seeing
all their metrics right from their wrist during a workout. The watch's sensors makes it possible
to see your heart rate, calories burned, pace and distance. And that data helps keep you motivated
and on track, which is awesome. With Fitness+, you simply
choose the workout you want to do from the catalog of videos
on your iPhone, iPad or Apple TV. And when you start the video, it automatically starts
the correct workout in your Apple Watch Workout app. And it sends those metrics in real time right to the screen
you're viewing the workout. So you have all of your data on your wrist
and on the screen in front of you, and your metrics come to life
to keep you motivated. For example, when the trainer reminds you
to check your heart rate, your numbers get larger, making it easy
to see the details you need. When you're in the middle
of a tough interval, you see a countdown timer to motivate you
to push through every last second. Your Activity Rings are also
right on the screen, so you can see how your workout
is helping you make progress towards closing your rings for the day. And if you happen to close
one of your rings in the middle of your workout,
you won't miss the celebration. You'll see it in real time,
right on the screen. When the workout is over,
you get a comprehensive summary. And all of that data captured
from your watch's sensors is shown right on the summary screen: calories burned,
average heart rate, distance, pace, even your current Activity Rings. Of course, there's a lot more
to the experience. Fitness+ is launching
with the most popular workout types, so there is something for everyone: yoga... cycling... dance... treadmill walk and treadmill run... strength... core... HIIT... rowing... and even mindful cooldowns. You can do the workouts
with any brand of equipment, and many of the workouts
require just a set of dumbbells or no equipment at all. Of course, you can do them
wherever it's convenient for you: at home... the gym... outside... or even when you're traveling. We think the flexibility
to do the workout you love when you want and where you want makes Fitness+
the perfect workout companion. Each week,
our incredible trainer team will deliver a wide variety of workouts
from the Fitness+ studio to help keep you engaged. That's fresh, new workouts every week
across a range of times and instructors. And of course, the trainers will have
the best music to keep you motivated, whatever your musical taste: from Latest Hits and Hip-Hop
to Latin Grooves and Top Country. And if you're also
an Apple Music subscriber, it's easy to save the playlists
from Fitness+ and then listen to them later
in Apple Music, whether you're working out or not. And if you're brand-new to fitness, or it's been a while
since you've worked out, there's an absolute beginner program
built right in. The program will help you get started, learn the basics of movement and fitness, and get you safely ready
for the studio workouts. We wanted to make it easy
to find all the workouts you love in Apple Fitness+, so they're all located
inside the Fitness app on the iPhone right in the center tab. And you can access the same workouts
from the new Fitness app on your iPad and Apple TV. To quickly get to your next best workout, you'll find recommendations
personalized just for you. Intelligent suggestions will make it easy
to find what you like and also encourage you to discover
new trainers and new workouts to balance out your routine. And that's Fitness+. You get ten different types
of studio workouts, so there's something for everyone, incredible music built into each workout
to keep you moving, and the world's best trainers. Whether you work out every single day, want to add
a little more fitness to your life, or you just want to get started, we think Fitness+ is gonna
take your workouts to the next level with convenience,
expert coaching and inspiration, and it's all powered by Apple Watch. As with all of
Apple's products and services, we've designed Fitness+
with privacy in mind. All your Fitness+ workout recommendations are powered using on-device intelligence, and when using Fitness+, neither calories, nor the workouts
and trainers you choose will be stored along with your Apple ID. The price is $9.99 per month or just $79.99 for a whole year. And your family will also be able to enjoy
Fitness+ for no additional charge. Fitness+ will be available
in these countries at launch, the service will be available
before the end of the year, and for those purchasing
a new Apple Watch, you get Fitness+ free for three months to help you make 2021
your fittest and healthiest year ever. And now, I'd like to hand it over to Lori
to share some more exciting news about our services. Apple Fitness+ joins our collection
of world-class subscription services that enrich our customers' lives. These are services that so many of us,
and our families, use every single day, and we want to make it easy
for everyone to discover and enjoy them. So today, I'm excited to introduce... Apple One. Apple One gives you and your family
all the services you love in one simple plan. It starts with iCloud, the essential service that safely stores
your personal photos, videos and files so you can access them from anywhere. Apple Music, where you can stream 70 million songs
from all your favorite artists. Apple TV+,
with Apple Original series and films which have been nominated for 18 Emmys
in just the first year. Apple Arcade, with over 100 incredibly fun games
you can play anytime, anywhere. Apple One also includes Apple News+, with leading newspapers

powered by Apple Watch. Apple One makes it easy
to get all these services and find the one plan
that's right for you, starting with the Individual plan,
which offers the best of entertainment, including Apple Music, Apple TV+,
Apple Arcade, plus 50 gigabytes of iCloud. The Family plan lets you share
all these services with up to five members of your family, plus 200 gigabytes of iCloud. And in countries where available,
there's Premier, which adds Apple News+, Apple Fitness+ and a massive 2 terabytes of iCloud. It's everything for the entire family
for one incredible price. Apple One will be available this fall,
and it includes 30 days free, so you can try any of the services
you don't already have. That's Apple One. Now back to Tim. Now let's turn our attention to iPad. I love my iPad because it is
such an incredibly versatile device. Powerful and easy to use, it enables all of us to do
so many meaningful things every day. And now more than ever,
iPad has become even more important, keeping us close to the ones we love
when we can't be there in person, helping students learn remotely, helping people express and share
their creativity, reshaping how the world communicates. And iPad is providing a critical lifeline
for doctors, nurses and patients. Its versatility is what makes iPad
such an essential device. With the power of the App Store
and over a million iPad apps, the iPad can do
whatever you need it to do. We're inspired to see how iPad's impact
has been felt across the world. This year marks the ten years
since we shipped our very first iPad. And in that time, it has become one of the most successful
consumer electronics products ever. We've now sold over 500 million iPads
to customers around the world. And more and more new customers
are just discovering iPad for the very first time. In fact, more than half of our iPad customers
are buying their very first iPad. That's just incredible! And users love their iPads. iPad has been ranked number one
in customer satisfaction for ten straight years-- every year since it launched. Our users are doing more than ever
with iPad, so we continue to push iPad forward. This is a big year for iPad. Earlier this year, we made
some great updates to the iPad Pro, including the A12Z chip, new pro camera system, LiDAR Scanner and so much more. Today, we're updating
the rest of our full-size iPad lineup, starting with our most popular iPad. And here's Ted to tell you more about it. We're incredibly proud of the role iPad
is playing in the lives of so many people. Users love our iPad 7th generation because it delivers a beautiful
10.2-inch Retina display with support for Apple Pencil
and the full-size Smart Keyboard all in a thin, light
and affordable design. And our customers love
all the things they can do with it, from taking notes
as they learn something new to playing their favorite game. So this year,
we're taking its beloved design and cranking up the performance
with this... the new iPad 8th generation. It's more capable than ever, and it starts with the A12 Bionic. This chip is a powerhouse. It features a powerful CPU
and superfast GPU. Compared to the already fast chip
in last year's iPad, it has a 40% faster CPU and delivers a massive two-times jump
in graphics. This extra performance is great for everything from
working with high-resolution content to immersive gaming experiences. And compared to the competition
over the last year, it's not even close. This new iPad with the A12 Bionic
is up to two times faster than the top-selling Windows laptop, it's up to three times faster
than the top-selling Android tablet, and it's up to a whopping six times faster
than the top-selling Chromebook. iPad leaves the competition in the dust. And all that power is delivered
in a thin and light design that's super portable with great cameras
and all-day battery life. Now, our A-series chips are
more than a CPU and GPU. They include powerful custom technologies, like the Neural Engine
for machine learning, which comes to our most popular iPad
for the very first time. It's capable of processing
up to five trillion operations per second. And it powers some magical experiences
on iPad, like allowing you to instantly transform
the color of your photos or even analyze your tennis game and provide real-time stats
like ball speed and body positioning. Altogether, the A12 Bionic
takes performance to the next level and makes iPad more powerful than ever. Now let's talk about accessories. They expand the versatility of iPad. iPad 8th gen
works with the full-size Smart Keyboard and keyboards from Logitech, like the Combo Touch with trackpad and the Rugged Combo
that's so important for schools. And of course, this new iPad works
with one of our most beloved accessories, Apple Pencil. With its incredible precision
and low latency, plus features like
pressure sensitivity and tilt, it's the gold standard for creativity and enables artists
to bring their vision to life. And we've seen it become an essential tool
to journal and take detailed notes. We're blown away
by what we've seen people create with Apple Pencil on iPad. There's really nothing else like it. And taking the Apple Pencil experience
to a whole new level is iPadOS 14, which adds
powerful new pencil capabilities and other new features as well. Let's see it in action. iPadOS 14 makes iPad even more intuitive,
fun and productive, because you can get your work done
just about anywhere. Handwritten text is just as powerful
as typed text. iPadOS even understands what you write, letting you take quick actions
with just a tap. As you sketch, shape recognition helps you draw
perfect circles, stars and more. Smart Selection understands the difference
between handwriting and drawings, making it easy
to select only what you want and paste your handwritten notes
as typed text into another app. New compact UIs mean
you can stay focused on the task at hand. And we know,
once you start using Apple Pencil, you're not gonna want to put it away. So, we have Scribble, which lets you handwrite
into any text field, even straight into numbers... or to add a final thought
to that document you've been working on. The new iPad and the power of iPadOS 14
are an amazing combination, making it possible to express your ideas
however you want to, wherever you are. With iPadOS 14, the already amazing experience
of Apple Pencil gets even better. These powerful handwriting
and note-taking features join a host of other new features that continue to push
what's possible on iPad. And it all runs beautifully
on the new iPad 8th generation with its 10.2-inch Retina display, huge performance boost
from the A12 Bionic, keyboard and pencil support, great cameras and so much more. And it starts at just $329. And it's just $299
for our education customers. Nothing else delivers
this level of performance and capability at such an affordable price. Customers can order
iPad 8th generation today, and it will be available
starting this Friday. Now back to Tim. iPad 8th generation,
with its huge boost in performance, and the incredible features in iPadOS 14 will enable even more people
to do more amazing things. And that's not all. As I told you, we're updating
our entire full-size lineup. So that brings us to iPad Air. iPad Air was designed to deliver
pro features at a very affordable price. And today we are thrilled to introduce an all-new,
completely redesigned iPad Air. And here it is. ["Heybb!" by binki playing] This is the new iPad Air. And to tell you all about it,
I'd like to hand it over to Laura. The new iPad Air starts
with a gorgeous design. The all-new thin and light enclosure
and narrow border design features a beautiful all-screen display. Each element of iPad Air
is meticulously crafted, from the precisely machined top button to the sculpted detail around the camera. And the new iPad Air design
comes in five gorgeous colors, including a new rose gold,
green and sky blue finish. Our customers are going to love
these colors. And this new design features
a stunning Liquid Retina display. In the same footprint as the previous Air, the new iPad Air features a larger,
10.9-inch Liquid Retina display with a resolution of 2360 by 1640. That's over 3.8 million pixels for extra-crisp text and photos. And, it has advanced display technologies
like full lamination, wide color, True Tone and an anti-reflective coating that, combined,
deliver an amazing visual experience. To give our customers
this beautiful all-screen design meant finding a new home
for one of the most popular features: Touch ID. So we designed a next-generation Touch ID and integrated it
right into the top button. This provides convenient
and secure authentication while allowing the display
to extend on all sides. This is the smallest authentication sensor
we have ever designed, and it delivers the same performance,
ease of use and security you know and trust from Touch ID. The technology under the button
is really amazing. It uses a sapphire crystal lens
and next-generation custom sensor that more efficiently captures
the details of a fingerprint. And it uses a faster Secure Enclave to more quickly authenticate
the fingerprint data. And using it is as simple as ever: just touch the top button
to unlock your iPad, log in to apps or use Apple Pay. It's fast, easy and secure. Another reason customers love iPad Air
is its performance. So we're debuting
an incredibly powerful new chip which is going to give the new Air
a huge leap in performance. To tell you more, here's Tim Millet. I'm super excited to tell you
about the powerful new chip we built into the new iPad Air: our latest A-series processor, A14 Bionic. Our goal is to build chips
with industry-leading performance, powerful custom technologies
and extremely efficient use of energy to make every one of our products
best in class. One way we do this
is by aggressively adopting cutting-edge silicon process technology
year after year. And now with A14,
we'll be the first in the industry to use the breakthrough
five-nanometer process technology. The incredibly small scale of this process
challenges the laws of physics. In fact, we're talking about
a scale so small, the dimensions of these five-nanometer
transistors are measured in atoms. This means we were able to pack
11.8 billion transistors into A14. That's an increase of nearly 40%
over our seven-nanometer chip. We use these additional transistors
to deliver new features, increased power efficiency
and increased performance in nearly every aspect of the chip. A14 Bionic includes a big update
to our CPU. Our architecture runs
more instructions in parallel, resulting in great performance
at lower power. And it integrates large,
high-performance caches sized to meet the needs
of the most demanding applications. For A14's powerful new six-core design, this results in an enormous 40% increase
in CPU performance compared to the previous iPad Air. A14 also features
our newest GPU architecture, scaled to deliver
the maximum sustainable performance at the lowest possible power-- an approach that also allows us to deliver
industry-leading peak performance when it's needed most. For A14, our new four-core design delivers a 30% increase
in graphics performance as well. And when you compare
the new iPad Air with A14 to the best-selling laptop
in its price range, a device nearly three times thicker
and four times heavier, the new iPad Air has up to two times
faster graphics performance in its incredibly thin and light design. So for customers using iPad Air
for performance-intensive apps like editing 4K videos,
creating works of art or playing immersive games, the incredible performance of A14
can handle them all with ease. In addition to the blazing-fast CPU
and GPU, A14 is loaded with custom technologies
that drive the unique iPad experience, like a much faster Neural Engine, which will make iPad Air more powerful
for machine learning. By doubling the number of cores
to build a 16-core architecture, the Neural Engine in A14 is capable
of executing an amazing 11 trillion operations
per second. This increases ML performance by up to
two times over the previous generation. In addition, our CPU is further optimized with second-generation
machine learning accelerators, which come to iPad for the first time and accelerate the matrix multiplication
frequently used in ML computations at up to ten times faster
than the previous Air. Now, the combination
of the new Neural Engine, the CPU ML accelerators
and our high-performance GPU deliver breakthrough
machine learning capabilities to elevate apps built on Core ML
to an entirely new level of performance. So that's the new A14 Bionic. It delivers big performance updates
for the CPU and GPU, makes iPad Air much more powerful
for machine learning and also features the latest ISP
for higher-quality videos and photos and even faster Secure Enclave
for Touch ID. This is by far the most advanced chip
we've ever made, and we're thrilled
to bring it to the new iPad Air. Now back to you, Laura. Wow, the A14 is a huge leap forward
in performance. And we've worked with
a number of developers to see what they can do
with the new iPad Air. So let's take a look. I'm Karim Morsy.
I'm a developer of djay Pro AI. djay Pro AI is an app that brings all
the tools of a professional DJ to iPad. The A14 Bionic allows us to build
intelligent features into the app. You touch the record,
and then you start scratching. You can actually scratch in the air. It just blows our mind
that this is possible now. Hi, I'm Alexey from Pixonic,
developer of the game War Robots. The A14 Bionic chip allows us
to deliver console-level graphics on a device you can hold in your hands. It's quite amazing to have a real-time,
six-versus-six multiplayer game running on iPad at 60 frames per second. For example,
the textures are much more detailed, the shadows are dynamic, and reflections are more realistic. It looks amazing. I'm Andrius, and we're from Pixelmator. Pixelmator Photo is a photo editing app
for enhancing photos. So I think everyone's seen the movies
where somebody's pointing at a screen, and goes, "Okay, zoom in on that.
Now, enhance." And now I've brought that to iPad. The Apple Neural Engine
allows us to build functionality we never thought possible. The ML Super Resolution feature
finds individual details: edges, colors, gradients, textures, and it combines it back in an image. Now, we can build intelligent features
into the app. The possibilities
are just endless with this. [record scratches] With the A14 chip, the new Air is going to bring
incredible performance to customers looking to step up
to a more powerful iPad. And there's more. Another great feature
we're bringing to iPad Air is USB-C. USB-C increases data transfer speeds
up to 5 gigabits per second. That's a tenfold jump in performance
over the previous Air. It provides a fast connection
to a host of external devices, like cameras, drives
and external monitors up to 4K. The new Air also includes
great cameras front and back. The front 7-megapixel FaceTime HD camera
supports Smart HDR, improved 1080p video capture
and better low-light performance for really high-quality video calls. And on the back is the same
12-megapixel camera used in the iPad Pro, with focus pixels and a larger aperture
to capture incredibly sharp photos and stunning 4K video, enhanced with
improved video stabilization, so the photos and videos
our customers take with the new Air are gonna look better than ever. And to elevate the audio experience,
we've redesigned the speaker system, providing stereo audio in landscape mode. Great for kicking back and enjoying
your favorite movies and TV shows. The new Air also works
with our amazing accessories, including Apple Pencil, which attaches magnetically to the side
for pairing, charging and storage, and the beautiful Magic Keyboard, with floating design
and built-in trackpad. So this is the new iPad Air, featuring a 10.9-inch
Liquid Retina display, next-generation Touch ID, a huge boost in performance
with A14 Bionic, USB-C, advanced cameras, Wi-Fi 6 and LTE that's 60% faster. This is by far
the most powerful iPad Air ever. Let's check it out. [electronic music playing] So that's the new iPad Air, and we can't wait
to get it into our customers' hands. It'll start at $599. It will be available beginning next month. And finally, we're very proud that the new Air and eighth-generation iPad
have been carefully designed to have minimal impact on the environment and support
our overall net zero carbon goal. Both iPads use
100% recycled aluminum enclosures, and all of the wood fiber in the packaging
of both iPad models is recycled or comes from responsibly managed forests. Both iPads use 100%-recycled tin solder
in their main logic boards and are free of harmful substances. So while our work here is never finished, we're proud of the progress we've made
with these new products. So today, we have
our most advanced iPad lineup ever. It's really a huge year for iPad: an incredible new iPad Air delivering
more pro features to even more customers, an iPad 8th generation
with massive jump in performance, together with the latest iPad Pro and the mighty iPad mini, combined with the advanced features
in iPadOS 14 make these by far the most exciting
iPads we've ever shipped. Now back to Tim. What a great day of announcements. We will also be releasing
major OS updates tomorrow, beginning with iOS 14: a huge release that transforms
the core experience of iPhone with redesigned widgets
right on the Home screen, a new way to organize your apps
with the App Library and a new and even faster way to
experience apps the moment you need them with App Clips. iPadOS 14, which lets you do
even more with Apple Pencil, provides huge improvements to iPad apps and takes the iPad experience
even further. watchOS 7 provides a whole new way
to discover and share watch faces, a new Sleep app,
automatic handwashing detection and provides additional workouts
and fitness metrics. And tvOS 14, which makes
your big-screen experience even better with improved Picture in Picture, audio sharing with AirPods,
Apple Music lyrics, secure camera feeds from HomeKit
and multiuser gaming support. All of these new releases
will be available tomorrow. And all of the products we announced today
will ship with these OS updates. Thank you all for joining us. At Apple, our mission is to design
products and services that empower and inspire you. And we're so excited to see what you'll do with all of the new innovations
introduced today. Everyone take care,
stay safe, and have a great day. [Music] ridiculous ridiculous transitions okay what's up mkbhd here so let's talk max with apple silicon i have some thoughts so there's been a ton of tech events especially apple events in the last couple months lately today was the final one of 2020 the one more thing event and this is where we all were expecting to see the first mac with apple silicon and i know right off the top that's actually kind of niche as far as like who might be interested in that specifically but for me and maybe it's just a nerd inside me this was actually the one i was most excited for most people would probably pick the iphone events but this is one i don't know i was just very curious about i mean i'm already mostly a mac user i edit in final cut pro i've seen the struggles of what apple's had to deal with working with intel and the limitations of intel's chips and their laptops and desktops so i'm trying to figure out what what are they actually going to do how good can the apple silicon mac be versus what we already have so actually leading up to the event i thought and this i talked about this on the waveform podcast i thought it would be either a massive jump in efficiency or a massive jump in performance now you might say all right efficiency works because you could have the same laptop with the same form factor and size the same power but twice the battery life like that would be an amazing benefit of apple silicon or maybe they do performance maybe they do same battery life same size same laptop but it's twice as fast i was curious which one they would pick and then we saw it and it turns out they did both so they unveiled the first apple made chip for max it's called the m1 chip i figure the m stands for mac but then again the apple watch has the s6 chip but the w chip is in the headphones w1 and w2 and then the iphone has the a14 bionics so i don't know maybe m doesn't stand for mac but it's the m1 chip here and this chip is super impressive now of course asterisk all we have right now is claims we don't have an actual m1 chip mac sitting in front of us so all we can go by is what they said on stage apple's usually pretty good about delivering what they say on stage but just listen to these claims so the m1 is a five nanometer chip with eight total cores four high performance cores and then four high efficiency cores so it's kind of similar to what we've seen on ipad and iphone a series chips but it's not just the cpu it's a bunch of things all put together on the same what we'll call system on a chip and they're all integrated together so there's the eight core cpu we talked about but there's also an integrated gpu there's the neural engine 16 core neural engine and the ram is also built in so it's this tightly integrated soc where all the pieces talk to each other quickly and efficiently as possible and where the controllers and processes between them are built inside so right away if you think like me you can already see the upside and the downside the downside really just being the ram is built in to the m1 chip now so you don't have any more user upgradeable ram at all in any new mac with an m1 chip but now of course the upside is you don't have a separate cpu and gpu and ram all asking for power you have one very tightly integrated chip which can create those gains in like i was saying either efficiency or power and then i got to the first graph so look at this graph this is a graph of cpu power per watt so if the macbook air was operating at 10 watts dropping an m1 chip in there it just got at two times faster cpu is that what this means this this chart is kind of weird they didn't really label the axes and it's kind of arbitrary there's not really too many useful numbers in here it feels very marketing and like what even is the latest pc laptop chip we're talking about here it doesn't say so i don't know but it seems to be suggesting that this new macbook air with an m1 chip will be twice as fast as something and then they kept going with all the rest of the benefits of the gpu the 16 core neural engine all this stuff i guess you could say got my attention and then they started unveiling the actual max so sure enough the first one up is the new macbook air this super thin 13-inch laptop with a new m1 chip in there now just hold up one second if you recall the new macbook air refresh just happened like six seven months ago i reviewed it and the consensus was great little machine it's no wonder it's the most popular laptop apple makes as long as you don't need to do anything too power intensive it's pretty great so along comes this new m1 macbook air and immediately their claims are huge faster launching apps buttery smooth animations instant wake up from sleep thanks for that craig a 3.5 x times faster cpu five times faster graphics performance the storage is up to twice as fast thanks to a better controller in the m1 they showed it gaming they showed it editing multiple streams of 4k prores video wow wow a macbook air huh okay sounds like they want the performance route sounds like they just went straight for more power but then they also got to the battery of this macbook pro which they say will have 15 hours of wireless web browsing and 18 hours of video playback which is apparently six more hours than the last macbook air so they did both so okay that's a pretty impressive set of claims for macbook air 13-inch it'll still start at 9.99 maybe it's not the machine for me but that seems to address a lot of those little maybe it's not quite powerful enough for extra stuff and then you just get that and you're good but then they moved on to the 13-inch macbook pro so again it's the same design but basically just replaces the guts inside with the m1 and watch it fly so 2.8 times faster cpu performance five times faster graphics performance again tough to say what they're comparing it to but those are some massive numbers either way then they said it's three times faster than the best-selling windows laptop in its class but like what what even is the best wind what's the best-selling windows laptop we all know the best selling ones aren't the best performing ones so what do you compare that's kind of that's kind of a weird slide but then again they got to battery and they dropped 17 hours of web browsing or 20 hours of video playback which is apparently twice what they were quoting before twice the battery in the new macbook pro i'm just imagining like some of the cross-country flights i've been on where you're kind of checking on your battery as the movie plays to make sure you're not draining too fast 20 hours of video playback what that so they they crush battery and they have big performance gains some pretty big claims so that will start at 12.99 and they also did refresh the mac mini as well which makes sense because there's no uh dedicated gpus in those integrated gpu as well so that'll start at 6.99 so there's three new macs with the m1 chip so my take is i am very curious how these huge new performance gain claims will actually translate to real life and also how that lineup will sort of mesh itself out i know again the macbook air is the most popular laptop they make for a reason it's also the cheapest but also now it seems like it's even more eating into any reason to buy the 13-inch macbook pro if it's so powerful they have the same chip they seem like they'll be roughly equal in terms of performance but anyway it's not all sunshine and rainbows these machines are actually already up on apple.com to spec and buy like right now if you want to check them out and there's some things to keep an eye on one is no user upgradable ram like i said on any of these machines so not only does apple have insane control over the hardware components talking to each other for perfect optimization but they also have insane control over how much you will pay for a ram upgrade and since you can never upgrade the ram yourself you gotta buy the ram from apple then number two there's no new webcams on any of these laptops really the hardware is mostly unchanged i believe the air got a slightly improved display with p3 color but generally when they were talking about the m1 chip giving the laptops better webcam quality they were just talking about the image signal processor not an actual 1080p webcam sadly they're all still listed with a 720p webcam and then i also noticed only two thunderbolt usbc ports on the m1 macbook pro see there's always been two tiers of the 13-inch macbook pro one baseline version which has two thunderbolt ports and then the higher spec version which has two on each side so four the new one with the m1 chip for some reason has two which is odd and fun fact you can actually still buy the intel macbook pro if you want you can go to apple's website go to the new macbook pro and scroll down the intel ones are still here and the higher end one still has four ports so you get the upside of control and you get the downside of control apple's just decided you only need two ports for that macbook pro even though you're a pro and then really i believe most of the biggest numbers we're seeing as far as performance improvements will come from the best most well optimized apps and the ones that apple makes kind of reminds me of the new consoles actually so there is still broad app compatibility because old apps all still work and you can actually also now use mac apps and ipad and iphone apps all in mac os big sur but the biggest performance improvements those two three four five x improvements will come from apps that are actually really well optimized and that's gonna take time for developers to work in so it's not gonna be instant it'll be developing over time but you'll see stuff like you know the adobe suite is gonna be working on stuff in the coming months and there's new version of photoshop uh that'll be early next year so that's good so i think the most important quote of this event was near the end when they said the 13-inch macbook pro is the ultimate expression of what the m1 chip can do which yeah i believe that that makes a lot of sense we were looking forward to what they could do with a much bigger body and thermal envelope with apple silicon and their promising huge performance literally insane sounding battery life together m1 chip great but you know what i'm most excited for i am most excited for the rest of the lineup the desktops because see with the laptops and the mac mini you still are optimizing for a lower wattage and a smaller thermal envelope and you still need those high efficiency cores to kick in at the right times to actually achieve that amazing battery life and energy efficiency but in the desktops like when they eventually get to imac and imac pro and mac pro eventually in the m2 or whatever they call it that ship doesn't have to have so many efficiency cores right that ship doesn't have to have the ram built in i hope i don't think so so really what they can just optimize for is power power power and so for me as someone who's been very impressed with the mac pro's performance throughout this whole year i cannot wait to see what types of numbers you would get just optimizing for power and the whole rest of that lineup could be sick it's going to take some time it's going to be a process we're not going to see it right away but when we do that could be sick all i can do is cross my fingers that apple doesn't take the control thing too far like i said they didn't have to build in the ram but it made sense for the laptops and i kind of wonder what they're going to do with the rest of the lineup in other chips but that's what we know so far we i definitely got to get my hands on these laptops and figure out how well the numbers translate to real life but there you go for all the people who are asking me hey should i get a new macbook this year i'm thinking about a new laptop and i told you to wait i told you there was new macbooks coming now they're here you can literally get them like by the time you see this video you're welcome but definitely stay tuned for the reviews and we'll see how good they actually are so either way that's my thoughts that's been it thanks for watching catch you guys very soon in the next one peace Welcome to Miniature Cooking! You're watching Moroccan Apple Beef Stew Recipe. Hope you guys like it! Don't forget to subscribe! [ Music ] [ Applause ] [ Music ] [ Applause ] >> Wow! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Wow! Thank you! Wow! Wow! Thank you! Wow! Thank you! Thank you! Good morning! It is so great to be in New York. We love New York and it's so great to be here with all of you. You know, New York is home to one of the most vibrant creative communities on the planet. And so it's only natural that it would have a very special place in our heart at Apple. Today, we are especially thrilled to be at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. [ Applause ] This is a historic center for the arts. For over 150 years, it's showcased the work of adventurous and cutting-edge performers all around the world while serving the creative community here in Brooklyn. Apple's focus has always been on providing people the tools to unleash their creativity. That's why we're here today to talk about our most creative products, and of course that all starts with the Mac. [ Applause ] The Mac was the first computer that was designed for creativity, and it's become one of the world's most essential creative tools. We are in awe of the creative things that people do every day all around the world with the Mac. So we made a video of just some of these special people and I would love to play it for you now. [ Music ] [ Applause ] We are so inspired by these people and how the Mac has played such a vital role in their creativity. People love the Mac and they use it to create all kinds of amazing things every day. So it's not surprising to see that the Mac continues to attract so many new customers. In fact, over half of Mac buyers worldwide are new to Mac, and that number is a remarkable 76% in China. We're adding millions and millions of new customers every quarter, bringing our total active installed base to a new major milestone of 100 million Macs. [ Applause ] But what's most important to us is that in survey after survey, the Mac continues to be rated the number one in customer satisfaction -- by far. We are just so incredibly proud of this. Of course, one of the drivers for Mac's high customer satisfaction is macOS -- macOS is the soul of the Mac, with its beautiful and easy-to-use interface. We just released macOS Mojave and it is the best version of macOS by far, and people are really loving it. Great care has been taken to refine the look and feel and add more capability, all while preserving its legendary ease of use. MacOS Mojave brings new features that have been inspired by our Pro users but designed for all of us -- from the new gallery view which allows you to scroll through your files and find exactly what you're looking for, to the dramatic new look of Dark Mode, which helps you focus right on your content. We've got a feature called Stacks, which is a brand-new way to make your desktop clutter free. I really needed this, and it's really cool. And an entirely redesigned and personalized Mac App store. Mac OS Mojave helps our users get the most out of their Mac. Whether they want a powerful desktop experience or the freedom that comes with the portability of a notebook, our customers love their Macs. And they especially love one Mac in particular, one that they take with them everywhere they go and use for everything they do -- and that is the MacBook Air. [ Applause ] When Steve pulled that MacBook Air out of that envelope it was clear that things would never be the same. The MacBook Air's groundbreaking, incredibly thin, wedge-shaped design not only influenced the rest of the Mac product line for years to come, it changed the industry. It had a breakthrough unibody design and new technologies like the first all-flash architecture. And it was the very first thin and light notebook with all-day battery life. MacBook Air truly embraced the notion that less indeed could be more and it redefined the modern notebook in the process. Unlike any notebook that's come before or since, MacBook Air has become the most beloved notebook ever. [ Applause ] It's time for a new MacBook Air [cheering], one that takes the MacBook Air experience even further in the areas that are most important to our customers. And of course, what we all want in a MacBook Air is a retina display! [ Applause ] And I'm incredibly excited today to introduce an all-new MacBook Air with a retina display and a whole lot more -- and here it is. [ Music ] [ Applause ] This is the new Macbook Air and I'd like to bring up Laura Lagrove, VP of Hardware Engineering, to tell you all about it -- Laura. [ Applause ] >> I'm really excited to be here today to talk to you about the MacBook Air. Every part of the product has been redesigned and reengineered. Every detail has a remarkably precise fit and finish and everything you see and touch has been carefully refined. It's absolutely beautiful. [ Applause ] Now, as Tim said, the number one feature customers have wanted in a MacBook Air has been a retina display, but we've made the display better in every way. The familiar aluminum bezel -- sorry about that -- the familiar aluminum bezel of the current MacBook Air is gone. The new Air's sleek design takes the display glass right to the edge of the enclosure, forming borders that are 50% narrower. It features a 13.3 inch display, which is the perfect size for such a portable notebook. And when it comes to resolution, we've taken the pixels and quadrupled them, providing four times the resolution for over four million pixels. [ Applause ] So both text and images are sharper and more detailed. And with 48% more color, those images are more lifelike than ever. All of this comes together to give the new MacBook Air a retina display we know our customers are going to love. And even with this narrower border design, we were still able to keep the FaceTime camera at the top of the display, which is exactly where you want it when making a FaceTime call. And now, with the Group FaceTime feature in macOS Mojave, you can invite all of your friends to the conversation. Now next, the MacBook Air has another new feature that customers have been asking for, and that's Touch ID. [ Applause ] So now, with just the touch of a finger, you can unlock your MacBook Air, buy something cool on Apple Pay, or use Touch ID with a third-party app, like 1Password. With a durable sapphire crystal surface, we've put the Touch ID sensor right into the keyboard. And to enable Touch ID, the new Air comes with Apple's T2 Security Chip. T2 features a secure enclave which protects Touch ID information, but it also ensures that software loaded during the boot process has not been tampered with, offering the Air the most secure boot process of any notebook. T2 also features an SSD controller which has automatic on-the-fly data encryption, offering the most secure storage of any notebook so you can feel confident that your files and data are safe. In addition to security, T2 has a whole host of other features. It has a redesigned system management controller. It has an audio controller which delivers wide stereo sound and an always-on processor that enables Hey Siri. Next, the keyboard, where we've gone way beyond just adding Touch ID. The new MacBook Air has our latest generation keyboard with keys that offer four times the stability over the previous generation, creating a modern keyboard with a more precise and responsive typing experience -- and backlit with individual LEDs behind each and every key for more accurate illumination. And a modern keyboard deserves to be paired with a modern trackpad, so we've replaced the old diving board version with a new Force Touch trackpad. It has 20% more surface area which extends the functionality of multitouch gestures. And with pressure sensing capabilities and haptic feedback, it's quieter and more capable. So this delivers a trackpad experience that Apple is known for. Now, whether it's in dorm rooms or lounging on the sofa at home, we know customers spend a lot of time watching videos on their MacBook Air, so we wanted to make a better sound experience. Our acoustic engineering team has made huge strides in audio performance in all of our products -- and the MacBook Air is no exception. It is 25% louder. It has two times more bass and wide stereo sound. In addition, it has a three-microphone array, which will make those Group FaceTime calls crystal-clear and it also improves the voice recognition of Siri. And the new MacBook Air needs next-generation I/O. So the new MacBook Air has two Thunderbolt 3 ports. So from charging to data transfer to video-out, it's the most versatile port ever. And there's a whole host of devices you can connect -- from Thunderbolt and USB-C external storage, up to a 5K display, or eGPUs, that accelerate graphics up to 17 times. So the new Air can connect to just about anything. So now let's talk about the specs. There's an 8th-generation dual-core CPU, along with the latest Intel integrated graphics. And it also supports up to 16 GB, a faster memory, which is double the capacity of the previous Air. And SSD's that are up to 1.5 TB in capacity and 60% faster. So MacBook Air delivers the performance you need for all of your everyday tasks. Now, the MacBook Air set the bar for great battery life in a thin and light computer, and the new MacBook Air is no exception. It has the same great 12 hours of wireless web browsing, but now has up to 13 hours of iTunes movie playback. Engineering teams at Apple love a great challenge. And so we thought, what if we add all these amazing new features while making the MacBook Air even more portable? Well, the team responded. The new Air has an unbelievable 17% less volume than it's predecessor. [ Applause ] And it's incredibly thin. It's just 15.6 mm, which is 10% thinner than the previous Air. And yet, with all these new features, the new MacBook Air weighs just 2.75 pounds. [ Applause ] That's a quarter pound lighter than the previous Air. Perfect for the notebook you want to take with you everywhere. So that's the new MacBook Air, with a stunning 13 inch retina display, Touch ID, advanced security, a force touch trackpad, and so much more. And with all the care and attention that we put into design and engineering, our teams work just as hard to ensure that our products are environmentally friendly. In fact, on the new MacBook Air, we use 100% recycled tin in our logic board. And we have significantly increased the amount of postconsumer recycled plastic in our internal components, such as the speakers. But there's one big goal that we've had for many years. Every Mac enclosure is made from aluminum. Now, we use aluminum because it has incredible strength, durability, and its sheer beauty. To achieve that, we've had to rely on mining high purity ore, that is until today. Apple's metallurgy team has designed an aluminum alloy that uses excess aluminum from the production process, delivering the same great characteristics we expect in all of our products. And this is a huge breakthrough. So we're really proud to say today that every new MacBook Air is made from 100% recycled aluminum. [ Applause ] This helps reduce the carbon footprint of the new Air by nearly 50% and makes it the greenest Mac ever. So to hear more about this alloy and all of the new features of the MacBook Air, we've created a video that I'd like to play for you now. >> When MacBook Air was introduced, it defined what an ultrathin, ultralight notebook could be. With the new MacBook Air, we're bringing many of our most advanced technologies to this iconic design. The powerful new features in macOS Mojave come to life on the incredibly vivid and precise retina display. It contains over 4 million pixels, which provide remarkable clarity, high contrast, and brilliant color. The 8th-generation dual-core processor is powerful and efficient, while helping to achieve all-day battery life. The Apple T2 Security Chip delivers advanced security and Hey Siri to MacBook Air. Along with a Touch ID sensor, it enables Apple Pay and allows you to unlock your Mac with just the touch of a finger. The latest generation butterfly keyboard is backlit and provides more stability, precision, and responsiveness. And a much larger force touch trackpad has built in force sensors that allow you to click anywhere and experience a finer level of control. High fidelity speakers deliver significantly more volume and bass for a fuller sound and wide dynamic range. Thunderbolt 3 integrates USBC into the most powerful and versatile port ever. And for the first time, the unibody enclosure is made from 100% recycled aluminum. To accomplish this, we invented a new custom alloy. It's designed to use fine shavings of recaptured aluminum that are reengineered down to the atomic level. This new alloy is as beautiful and robust as any we've used before. And it makes MacBook Air the greenest Mac ever. With powerful new technologies and an all new design and three beautiful finishes, the new MacBook Air not only reimagines what our most loved Mac can be, but also how it can be made. [ Applause ] >> What a huge leap forward for MacBook Air. So the new MacBook Air is configured with 8 GB of memory, a 1.6 core i5 processor with Turbo up to 3.6, and 128 GHz of storage, and will start at $1199. Making it the most affordable retina Mac we've ever offered. [ Applause ] You can order it starting today. And it will be available next week. [ Applause ] So that's the redesigned, reengineered MacBook Air. So whether you're a student, a writer, an entrepreneur, or simply new to Mac, we think you're going to love it. Now back to Tim. [ Applause ] >> Thank you! Thank you, Laura! What a fantastic and beautiful new MacBook Air! I can't wait for you to get your hands on this. I really think you're going to love it. Now, there's another small but mighty Mac our users have been waiting for. And here it comes. [ Music ] [ Applause ] The new Mac mini! Now I'd like to introduce you to Tom Boger, our head of Mac Product Marketing to tell you all about the new Mac mini. Tom! [ Applause ] >> Thank you, Tim! I can't wait to tell you about the biggest update ever to the new Mac mini. Now, I'm sure you've noticed that we've given it an awesome space gray finish. For one, we know our Pro customers are going to love that. But, two, this new Mac mini is an absolute beast on the inside. Here's why. The number one thing our customers wanted us to do is give it more powerful processors. So now every Mac mini starts with 4 cores. [ Applause ] Taking performance to a whole new level. But we didn't think that was far enough, so we're also giving Mac mini 6 core processors as well. [ Applause ] And these aren't mobile parts, no. These are higher power 8th-generation CPUs with faster graphics too. So the performance boost is incredible. Making the Mac mini up to -- wait for it -- five times faster than before! [ Applause ] Think about that, five times faster! Ripping through traditional desktop apps, like Logic and Photoshop, and workflow apps, like MainStage and Compressor, making this by far the most powerful Mac mini we've ever made. Next up is memory. Now, the previous Mac mini went up to 16 GB of memory. So naturally, the new Mac mini goes to 32 GB of memory. But we didn't want to stop there either. So the new Mac mini can now go up to 64 GB of memory. [ Applause ] And not only is this memory faster, it's also an SO-DIMMs, something we know our Mac mini customers will really appreciate. Next up is storage. Now, many Mac mini customers depend on the speed and reliability of SSD's. So now every Mac mini has all flash storage, with SSD's that are up to four times faster, and capacities up to 2 TB. And that's double the capacity of the previous Mac mini. And every new Mac mini also has the Apple T2 security chip, with its many new features, including HEVC video encode that -- get this -- 30 times faster! [ Applause ] It's incredible. So to cool all this powerful new technology, the new Mac mini has an entirely new thermal system with double the airflow, while still being super quiet. And finally, connectivity. Mac mini customers love having lots and lots of ports. And the new Mac mini delivers. With gigabit ethernet, four -- count them, four -- Thunderbolt 3 ports, an HDMI port, two USB-A ports, it can connect to almost anything. And not only that, you can configure the Mac mini with 10 gigabit ethernet as well for superfast networking performance. So now the Mac mini is a much faster, way more capable Mac desktop that allows you to choose your own display, keyboard, and mouse. But the Mac mini can go so much further. Small yet powerful, the Mac mini is the perfect component for many creative uses, like running MainStage in a sound rig for live performances. Or using it for the production of a live interactive art performance, as students are doing today at the California Institute of the Arts. Or use more than one so you can fly through video encoding faster in applications like Compressor. And on a movie set, as Paramount Pictures is doing in the filming of Rocket Man, their musical fantasy about Sir Elton John. Or use Mac mini to compile code from a MacBook Pro, so it can do other tasks. Or string a number of Mac minis together so you can form your own build farm. Or rack thousands of them together, like Mac stadium -- a company that has nearly 8000 Mac minis. 8000! That developers use to make some of your favorite apps, like Candy Crush, Shopify. They wanted more. They run 24/7 with data centers around the world, it's the very definition of mission-critical and it all runs on Mac mini. So that's the new Mac mini, with all these great new features. The entry config has 8 GB of memory, a 3.6 GHz quad-core processor, and 128 GB SSD. And it starts at just $799. [ Applause ] And with those performance and features, it's by far the best value that we've ever offered in a Mac mini. You can configure it up to 64 GB of memory, a higher frequency Core i7 processor, up to 2 TB SSD, and with 10 Gb Ethernet. You can order it starting today and it will be available next week. [ Applause ] And like all of our products, it checks all of the boxes on the environmental checklist. And like the new Air, we're using more and more post-consumer recycled plastic in parts like the foot. And every Mac mini enclosure is made from -- you guessed it -- 100% recycled aluminum. [ Applause ] Helping to reduce its carbon footprint by nearly 50%. So that's the new Mac mini. It's the biggest update ever and we can't wait to get it into the hands of all of those customers out there that are so passionate about the Mac mini. And now, back to Tim. [ Applause ] >> All right! Thank you, Tom, and thanks again, Laura. The new Macbook Air and Mac mini, they are absolutely amazing! These new Macs are going to help our customers be even more productive and more creative. Now, there are ways that Apple aims to inspire creativity in our users, including in our stores. The mission of our stores has always been to enrich the lives of our customers by educating and inspiring them to go even further. One of the new ways that we're taking their creativity even further is through our Today at Apple sessions [applause]. Yeah! [ Applause ] To share more with you about the latest on Today at Apple, I'd like to invite up Angela -- Angela! [ Applause ] >> Good morning. Good morning. It is so great to be back in New York, and we especially love being a part of the creative energy here in Brooklyn. This is what we're trying to replicate all over the world. You've heard us talk about retail as our largest product, how we think about the architecture as our hardware and the experience inside, like our software. We call it Today at Apple. We started with the things that are core to Apple's DNA, things people most use the devices for and trust us to teach them, like photography, music, gaming, and app development. And as Apple continues to develop curriculum like Everyone Can Code and Everyone Can Create, we embed these lessons and techniques into our Today at Apple programming for all customers, including educators and entrepreneurs. And we hold all of our sessions in all 505 retail locations, like at Apple Cotai Central in Macau, which opened a few months ago. Here, customers are attending a session called Photo Walks, where they learn new features, like portrait lighting and depth control, while exploring the city together in a real social way. Or Apple Garosugil in Seoul, which opened this past spring, where customers participate in labs, our most advanced sessions, like a music lab called Building Your Sound co-created with Florence of Florence and the Machine, where our creative pros help customers compose a song using GarageBand. And also this month, as a part of EU Code Week, we hosted sessions like Swift on iPad and Xcode on Mac, teaching over 2000 coding sessions throughout Europe. [ Applause ] And at Apple Piazza Liberty in Milan, which just opened this past summer, customers are loving Sketch Walks, where they learn to capture the city through drawing and painting on iPad. And we're especially thrilled when our sessions inspire customers to go even further with their passions, like Sarah here, who after attending a few Live Art sessions in a lab in Florence, illustrated and published her first children's book. [ Applause ] And as we continue to push the design of our flagships to be even greater gathering places where everyone is welcome, we're also creating global platforms for local talent. Photographers, musicians, developers, and artists share their creative gifts. This month, in partnership with The Big Draw festival, local artists have been leading sessions in our flagships globally, teaching and celebrating drawing -- like Josh Cochran, a local New York artist, who's leading a session across the street this afternoon. Since the launch of Today at Apple only 18 months ago, we have held over 18,000 sessions a week, attended by millions of curious creatives around the world. [ Applause ] And with the newest release of the Apple Store app, we've made it even easier for you to find out what's happening near you. Just tap on the Sessions tab and you'll see a spotlight of the newest Today at Apple sessions in your city. It will also recommend sessions based on the products that you own, and signature programs like Music Labs, Kids Hour, and Photo Walks. That's a quick update on Today at Apple, our new in-store experience since we launched, but we're not stopping here. Today, we're announcing 60 newly-designed sessions. [ Applause ] Video -- video, music, and design have all been expanded, and we're adding walks and labs to most categories. And of course, we're using Apple's latest technologies, like AR and Siri Shortcuts. We're creating our first video lab called Small Screen Magic, co-created with video maker Zach King. You'll learn how to shoot and edit fun videos using the Clips app. We're also introducing a new photo lab called Fun Family Portraits. You'll use live photos to capture action, experiment with filters, and use Apple Pencil to make your portraits even more fun. And we're introducing a design lab called Drawing Treehouses, co-created with architects, Foster and Partners, where you'll learn architectural principles through the lens of fantasy. And for the Mac, we're launching a new Pro series, like this video lab called Color and Mood with Final Cut Pro. You'll learn how to use color to enhance the visual feeling of your footage. And a music lab called Advanced Beat Making with Logic Pro, where you'll sample audio, design sounds, and program different styles of beats. So that's a sneak peak of a few of the new sessions launching in the new year. And to further scale Today at Apple in every city, every day, in every store, we're also upgrading our existing fleet, creating forums in over 70 stores a year, like this recent renovation of Apple Covent Garden in London, just reopened a few days ago and they're live streaming the event today. And we'll continue to open flagships designed to amplify Today at Apple around the world. In June, we opened our first flagship in Seattle: Apple University Village. And on November 10th, were launching Today at Apple at our first store, Apple Iconsiam in Bangkok, Thailand, and we're excited to be a part of the creative energy in this city. And a few weeks later, we open Apple Champs-Elysees, with one of our grandest forums in Europe to further be a part of the creative renaissance in Paris. And just like all of our Apple products, we continue to minimize our environmental footprint. In fact, all of our retail locations run on 100% renewable energy. [ Applause ] We feel that Today at Apple could be retail's greatest platform for enriching lives. It's designed to encourage human connection, inspire new learning, and unlock creativity and creative thinking for all generations. And Today at Apple is brought to life by our 3000 Apple Creatives and the entire retail team, whose passion, energy, and commitment to humanized technology helps unleash the creative potential in us all. Thank you so much. Back to you, Tim. [ Applause ] >> Wow! No one else has anything like Today at Apple. In addition to the 3000 creative pros, have over 70,000 team members that are dedicated to help you get the most out of your products. And they are the best team on the planet! [ Applause ] I am moving to New York [laughter]. Now let's talk about another powerful, creative product, iPad. [ Applause ] iPad -- iPad is a magical piece of glass that transforms instantly into anything you want it to be -- portable, versatile, and powerful, while at the same time, be incredibly easy to use. We've now sold well over 400 million iPads, making it the most popular tablet by far. No one else is even close. But what you might not know is we've sold more iPads in the last year than the entire notebook lineup of all of the biggest notebook manufactures! [ Applause ] This makes iPad not only the most popular tablet, but the most popular computer in the world! It's pretty phenomenal. Now, the iPad line today is comprised of the iPad mini, the iPad, and the iPad Pro. The iPad mini and the iPad our most affordable iPads and they bring versatility and capability to as many users as possible. While iPad Pro pushes the boundaries to deliver our most cutting edge creative iPad experience. It includes our most advanced technologies and our highest performance. iPad Pro delivers so much capability to our users, and we have been absolutely amazed at the creative things they've done with it. That's why we created iPad Pro. Today we're announcing an all new iPad Pro. [ Applause ] It's going to push what you can do on iPad or on any computer even further. And here it is. [ Music ] [ Applause ] This is the new iPad Pro! And to tell you all about it, I want to bring up my colleague, John Ternus, Vice President of Hardware Engineering. John! [ Applause ] >> Thank you, Tim! I am thrilled to be able to tell you about this new iPad Pro. It marks the biggest change since the original iPad. And we have made it better in every possible way. In fact, this really is the iPad we dreamed about building from the very beginning. We've always felt that the iPad should be all about the display. And in this new iPad Pro, we have an LCD that stretches from edge to edge and top to bottom. Now, we achieved this design by rounding the corners of the display using the same pixel masking and anti-aliasing technology that we introduced in the iPhone X-R. Just like in the X-R, we call it a liquid retina display. It is packed with our most advanced technologies, like Wide Color, True Tone, ProMotion, and of course, support for Apple Pencil. And this all comes together to deliver the most accurate, responsive, and beautiful display we have ever made. Now, the narrow border design gave us an opportunity to take a fresh look at our iPad Pro sizes. The original 10.5 inch iPad Pro is an amazing device, that offers plenty of area to get your work done, and an enclosure that's large enough to support a full-size keyboard, but it's still just one pound and super portable. It really has been the ideal option for most of our iPad Pro customers. So we decided to maintain that perfect footprint but give you an even bigger display. This is the same take-anywhere size you loved in the 10.5 inch design, but now with an 11 inch display. [ Applause ] And it has a quarter million more pixels. But of course, for our customers who want an even larger canvas, we also offer the 12.9 inch display. And all that real estate makes multitasking and working with Apple Pencil an incredible experience. With this new iPad Pro, we're able to offer that same large-screen experience in a much more portable package. And this is the new 12.9 inch iPad Pro. [ Applause ] It is dramatically smaller. In fact, it's now almost exactly the same size as an 8 1/2 x 11 piece of paper. And it's not just smaller, it's also thinner. These new iPad Pros are just 5.9 mm thin. In the case of the 12.9 inch, it's nearly 15% thinner than before. So altogether, that means this new 12.9 inch iPad Pro is an incredible 25% less volume than its predecessor. [ Applause ] It fundamentally changes the experience of using it. You really have to hold one to understand it. And we think when people do, many more folks will move up to the larger size. It really is the ultimate iPad. And that's especially true because it now has Face ID. [ Applause ] Now, on iPhone X, Face ID set the bar for intuitive, seamless, and secure authentication. But it's even better on the iPad Pro. On iPad Pro, Face ID delivers facial authentication that is more secure than any tablet or any computer. With a simple glance, you can unlock your iPad, you can log in to your favorite apps, and of course, you can even pay for something with Apple Pay. Face ID is enabled by the Truth Depth Camera which is tucked away into this thin bezel. It uses depth technology to greater security and accuracy than any 2-D face scanner. But bringing it to the iPad Pro meant we had to optimize the cameras and we even had to retrain the underlying neural networks to work specifically in all the ways that you use your iPad: portrait, landscape, attached to a keyboard. And no matter how you use these new iPad Pros, they are always right-side up. Now with support for Face ID, you might have noticed there's no longer a home button. Well, no home button means that all those familiar gestures from the iPhone 10 now come to the iPad. So, for instance, you can swipe down from the upper right-hand corner to get to control center. You access the dock by swiping up from the bottom. If you continue swiping up and pause, you get to the App Switcher. And you can even swipe along the bottom edge to quickly switch between your most recently used apps. You can work with two apps at once using Split View. You just drag an app up from the dock to the side, and then you can easily drag-and-drop between them. And Slide Over gets you a quick view to another app, like when you need to quickly respond to a message. There's always plenty of room to get what you need done. This new iPad experience is all about making the most of these large displays, with space for creativity and to work with multiple apps at once. And all that is possible because of what we put under the hood, because these new iPad Pros are powered by the all-new A12X Bionic -- and this thing is a monster! [ Applause ] Just like the A12 in our latest phones, it's built on our latest 7 nm technology. No other tablet, laptop, or even desktop has been able to make this leap forward. And it offers a huge jump in both performance and energy efficiency. But since this is an X chip, it means we went bigger than the A12 -- much bigger. In fact, this new A12X has more than 10 billion transistors. [ Applause ] But what's more incredible is what we've been able to do with all of them. The A12X features an 8-core CPU with 4 performance cores and 4 high-efficiency cores. And with our latest-generation performance controller, multithreaded workloads can now leverage all 8 of those cores simultaneously. The results of all this are pretty amazing. Single core performance is up by 35% compared to last year's already really fast iPad Pros. And with the increase in core count and gains in efficiency, multicore workloads are now up to 90% faster. [ Applause ] This is a huge step forward. And here's another way to think about it. These iPad Pros are faster than 92% of all the portable PCs sold in the last 12 months, including the most popular Core i7 models from the top manufacturers. Now of course our X chips have also always been about big graphics, and these new iPad Pros do not disappoint. The A12X Bionic has an all-new Apple-designed 7-core GPU that delivers two times the performance of the previous generation. And this is great. Compared to our 1st-generation iPad, the graphics in these new iPad Pros is now 1000 times faster [applause]. That is nuts! [ Applause ] To put it another way, the iPad Pro delivers Xbox One S-class graphics performance in a product that's 94% smaller, and there's no AC cord required. In fact, like all of our iPads, it delivers amazing all-day battery life. But of course, we didn't stop with just incredible CPU and graphics. On board the A12X and coming for the first time to an iPad, we have our latest generation of the neural engine. And just like in the A12, the neural engine is capable of delivering an unbelievable 5 trillion operations per second, which is all in service of delivering incredible performance in ML tasks. So with that, these new iPad Pros aren't just faster than your last computer, they're also smarter and more capable. Some apps can do some amazing things, like photos, which uses machine learning to classify and organize your photos so you can always find what you're looking for. And it also stitches together all of those photos and videos to create those amazing memories. But other apps can take advantage of this as well, like Pixelmator Photo, which uses a neural network derived from over 20 million image pairs to determine how to intelligently enhance your photos, just like a pro photographer would. And our chip team has done so much more with A12X. Dedicated hardware blocks deliver high performance and high efficiency in everyday tasks, like capturing images and shooting video. There's simply nothing like this in other traditional PC chipsets. And this year we have a new fast storage controller on the A12X which enables up to 1 TB in storage capacity. [ Applause ] We think this is really going to help to free up those creative pro work flows. And that new fast storage controller also enables something else that's really big because a high-performance computer deserves a high-performance connector. And so in these new iPad Pros, we're moving to USB-C. [ Applause ] This brings a whole new set of capabilities to the iPad Pro, like connecting your accessories to change how you use your iPad, cameras, musical instruments, or even docks. Or connecting to high-resolution external displays up to 5K. And with USB-C, you can connect to these data accessories and displays at the same time. We think our Pro customers are really going to love this. And also, for the first time on these iPad Pros, we now support charging out over USB-C, so you can even charge your iPhone when you're on the go. [ Applause ] Now, one of the most important and game-changing accessories for the iPad Pro has been the Apple Pencil, with its lowest latency, subpixel precision, force and tilt sensing, the Apple Pencil is absolutely the tool to reach for whether you're retouching a photo, jotting down notes, or sketching. And with these new iPad Pros, the second-generation pencil has been completely redesigned. The new Apple Pencil attaches magnetically to the iPad Pro. It automatically pairs and starts charging wirelessly. [ Applause ] And because it's always charging, it's always ready to go the moment you need it. Tapping the screen with the Apple Pencil will wake the iPad Pro and launch instantly into the Notes app. And this year, there's a whole new way of interacting with the Apple Pencil. Just tap twice on it to switch modes. In Notes, you can switch between your current tool and the eraser. And in other apps, this behavior will be customizable, which puts even more control into our users' hands. Also this year, we have a new Smart Keyboard Folio that continues to deliver great typing experience in a thin and light design with no pairing, charging, or batteries required -- and it's even simpler to use. It magnetically attaches to the iPad Pro and it protects both the front and the back. And there's a screen angle that is great in your lap, and another that's great at your desk. We think this is what makes iPad so unique. No other device can easily adapt to your needs the way that iPad can. On its own, iPad is the most personal and powerful tool for all of the things that you do most. But by adding just the right accessory, it totally transforms the experience. Add the Apple Pencil, it becomes your sketchbook. Add the Smart Keyboard, it becomes your mobile office. Or add an external monitor, and you have an editing bay. No other device offers this level of flexibility. But not only is iPad amazing for all of the things you do today, but also the perfect tool for creating totally new experiences, like Augmented Reality. With its large display and a thin and light design, iPad is the best device ever created for AR. [ Applause ] And we've optimized these iPad Pros to make AR even better. We've calibrated the cameras and sensors in all of these components in A12X to deliver realistic graphics, real-time lighting and object tracking, and incredible texturing and reflections. And with ARKit 2, we give apps enhanced surface detection and persistent experiences. And all of this comes together to completely transform how you can interact with the world around you. These new iPad Pros are packed with our most advanced technology. There's the new all-screen design with liquid retina display, advanced Face ID, the A12X Bionic chip delivering incredible, Pro-level performance, 4-speaker audio -- and this time with woofer and tweeter pairs in each corner. They sound amazing and they offer wide stereo output. Gigabit-class LTE and eSIM technology in our cellular models for great conductivity wherever you go. And so many more features that make this our very best iPad. And we now have brand-new designs for the Apple Pencil, the Smart Keyboard Folio, and USB-C, which offers high-performance connectivity to a wide variety of accessories. But that said, the new iPad Pro really comes to life through the incredible apps that have been designed for it. And to tell you more about that, I'd like to invite Shaan Pruden, Senior Director, Worldwide Developer Relations to the stage -- Shaan. [ Applause ] >> Our developers are amazing! Today there are over a million apps specifically designed to transform your iPad into anything you need with just a tap. And with the new iPad Pros, apps you already know and love are going to look better and perform even faster than before -- like Procreate for sketching an illustration, capturing notes with Notability, or using Morpholio Trace for architectural drawings. But with the performance and capabilities of the all-new iPad Pros, our developers are going to be able to create experiences that were not possible before. For the first time, Autodesk will be bringing the desktop engine of AutoCAD to the iPad. This will allow customers to view and edit files that contain hundreds of thousands of objects like you see here with performance as fast as the fastest PCs. [ Applause ] And this is Assassin's Creed Rebellion from Ubisoft, a fan favorite on the console coming to the iPad for the first time. Not only does the new iPad unlock stunning visual effects, like ambient fog and sunlight streaming through these windows, but it also delivers on the next level of texture and detail on everything you see. And it's running at an unbelievable 120 frames per second, something no console can deliver. [ Applause ] djay Pro is used by millions of DJs around the world, and Algoriddim's been able to harness the power of the A12X Bionic to deliver up to five times as many video clips that you can mix simultaneously. And using Core ML, dozens of audio samples can be key and beat matched in real time to deliver performances that are perfectly in tune and on rhythm -- unprecedented on a mobile device. [ Applause ] As you can see, iPad Pro delivers the power and versatility our customers demand wherever they are. Now, I'd like to introduce you to two developers to show you what's possible on these new devices. First, let's talk about gaming. On the large, 120 Hz display with Pro performance and 4-speaker audio, iPad Pro is the ultimate gaming platform you can take anywhere. And here to show you what they've been able to accomplish is Greg Thomas, Executive Vice President at 2K Games. [ Applause ] For more than 20 years, NBA 2K has set the standard for realistic game play and attention to detail. Each year, fans have been delighted to be able to experience the NBA on their consoles. And now, with this incredible new iPad, 2K and Visual Concepts have brought that same console realism to iOS. Everything we're going to show you today has never been possible on a mobile device before. Choose your favorite team and players. Many of you may recognize Barclays Center. We've recreated it exactly so that your Brooklyn Nets feel right at home today. But I see my buddy Mike here has chosen the World Champion Golden State Warriors. But if you want to play as Steph Curry, you can play as Steph Curry. Watch the player with the blue circle at his feet as the rest of the team moves across the court. Using seamless motion matching and inverse kinematics, we're able to create an unlimited number of animations, all at 60 frames per second. Okay, let's take a step back and look at this beautiful arena. Even the sidelines and the thousands of fans are individually rendered in high resolution. This new iPad is simply amazing and it provides an experience that rivals consoles for the very first time. Okay, let's take a look at a player. How about D'Angelo Russell? We meticulously recreate every single NBA player using high-end shaders to get all of the details to pop. Just look at his hair, the accurate tattoos, the beads of sweat on his skin. We've even rendered his jersey down to the pin holes. Okay, let's get back to game and see how the warriors are doing. Oh, nice move! This is stunning, and now we're able to add visual post effects, such as anti-aliasing, HDR bloom, and depth of field. In fact, we're rendering nearly six million pixels at full retina resolution with no upscaling. Okay, we've got a little bit of time left in this game. Mike, why don't you show us what you've got? Oh, time running out. Steph Curry, buzzer beater -- game-winner! Nice shot! NBA 2K Mobile -- we'll see you on the court. [ Applause ] >> Thanks, Greg. That's just a glimpse of the amazing performance of the all new iPad. As you can see, developers will be taking their games to the next level. Now let's turn to creativity. We've worked closely with our friends at Adobe for over 30 years, creating tools that have sparked entire new industries. And today, we're delighted to have them here to show you the future of creativity. Please welcome Adobe's VP of Design, Jamie Myrold. [ Applause ] >> Thanks, Shaan. I am so excited to be here today. So, at Adobe, the future of creativity extends beyond the desktop. Creative professionals want the ability to create with power and ease whenever and wherever inspiration strikes. A few weeks ago, at Adobe MAX, we revealed Photoshop on the iPad, and we also previewed Project Aero, our new augmented reality design tool. And today, we are super excited to show both of these, taking full advantage of the breakthrough performance of the amazing new iPad Pro. To show you, I've asked Chantel to join me -- Chantel. >> Thank you, Jamie. Let me show you the real Photoshop on iPad. Photoshop means having the familiar tools you need right where you expect them, here in the toolbar. Photoshop means having the full power of your layer stack and your adjustments. Now I want to make this flower in the middle really stand out. So let's add an adjustment layer and we can find a hue that really looks nice -- okay, right about there. And now let's use the brush tool and I can come in here and color back on that mask and just reveal the white petals below. And I'm doing this with the Apple Pencil. It feels so smooth and intuitive. It's great to be right here with the canvas. Okay, let's drop a blend mode on there and there we go. Now, this is Photoshop reimagined for touch. So we have instituted many ways to have contextual UI. So I can use this touch modifier under my thumb to switch between doing things I do all the time -- so duplicate and move. Now that flower looks nicely framed by those pops of yellow and we're ready to go. Okay. So let's zoom out and you can see this full bouquet. It's made up of 135 individual flower images, and you'll see that there's this really intricate mask applied to the whole layer stack. So that means that when I want to make adjustments, I can just dial it up, dial it down, and dial right into the saturation level that I want to see. Great. Okay, let's zoom all the way out. And you can see the sheer scale of this piece. It a real PSD, the same I would work with on the desktop. It's over 3 GB. It's 157 layers, 12,000 x 12,000 pixels, and I'm zooming through it at lightning speed, no lie. [ Applause ] And that is thanks to working on this new iPad Pro with 8 cores of pure power. So, at Adobe, we know that you creative pros need to dive down deep into the pixel level of precision, but then just as easily get right back out and see the full picture. So we've instituted a shortcut on the Apple Pencil. Just double tap, get right back out -- double tap, get right back in. [ Applause ] Ladies and gentlemen, this is Photoshop on iPad, just like you've always wanted. [ Applause ] Now let's talk about how you can experience your Photoshop files in a whole new way. This piece is 9' x 9' when printed at scale. And here on the screen, it already has the power to awe and inspire, but what if you wanted to step into that redwood forest? Well, with Project Aero, now you can. So let's take a look at that same PSD here in Aero, and it now has space between those layers. And because this is augmented reality, I can do things like bring in some interactive elements, like these butterflies. And I can set them to animate when I start the experience and now, I can use my iPad to become the cinematographer of this moment. [ Applause ] So now with Photoshop, Project Aero, and iPad, creatives can express themselves in a whole new medium with the tools they already know and love. Back to you, Jamie. [ Applause ] >> Thanks, Chantel. So that was truly amazing and that file created by Ysabel LeMay was just gorgeous. So, to recap, what you just saw, this was the real Photoshop. By this I mean the actual Photoshop engine running on iPad Pro, fully reimagined for the simplicity of touch and the precision of Apple Pencil. Soon, creative professionals are going to have the ability to create and edit high fidelity Photoshop files on the iPad Pro. We also showed you Project Aero, which is our new augmented reality design tool, and this tool will give designers the ability to use their skills in Photoshop to create next-generation immersive content. Look for both of these in the App Store in 2019. Thank you so much. Back to you, Shaan. [ Applause ] >> Wow! That was incredible! Thank you, Jamie and Chantel. On iPad Pro, these tools are powerful enough for professionals but easy enough for anyone to use. And that's why we're so excited to be partnering with Adobe on these and other next-generation apps for creative pros. This is what we mean when we talk about the iPad being a magical piece of glass that can be anything you need it to be. And with the next generation of apps from our developers, it's going to completely change how you get things done in ways you've never imagined. Back to you, John. [ Applause ] >> Thanks, Shaan. Those are some incredible apps. It's amazing how much performance we've packed into these iPads. We are so excited about the all-new iPad Pro that we made a video, and I'd love to run it for you now. >> This is the new iPad Pro. It's unlike any iPad or anything we've made before because everything has changed, starting with the screen, as an all-screen, that goes edge-to-edge on an impossibly thin profile -- no, thinner! No, thinner than that! Yeah, that thin. So it's not impossible. It just required fitting a larger display into a smaller form, including individual pixels to create perfectly-rounded corners, reengineering the TrueDepth Camera System, making the speakers smaller but louder, adding microphones, shrinking LEDs, pushing it all to the very edge so it fits within that narrow border, with everything still weighing about a pound. So when you hold it, the technology seems to recede and you're left feeling like you're essentially holding light. That's because the liquid retina display is our most advanced and responsive display ever. There's no more home button because it has Face ID, the most secure and seamless way to unlock your iPad. It's been redesigned to work in any direction, so there's no wrong way to unlock it or use it. It also has the most powerful and smartest chip we've ever made, made even smarter by the Apple neural engine, now on iPad for the very first time. It's powerful enough for Photoshop -- yeah, real Photoshop. And because of the chip, everything you do -- like surfing the web, messaging at the same time, dragging and dropping -- is faster than ever, and faster than 92% of portable PCs. But that's not all. We didn't just think about the iPad or the accessories, but how they all connect. That's why there are 102 magnets, all precisely aligned to create a perfect system. So you can do this -- and charge your Pencil at the same time. Drawing or writing will feel as natural as -- well, a pencil -- only better, because its cylindrical touch sensor gives you more control, like switching tools with a double tap. There's also a new keyboard that snaps into place like this -- and this -- which is perfect for Group FaceTime. And with USB-C, this now connects to that, that, that, and that. This makes things easy even if what you do is complex. iPad Pro is more versatile, more portable, more capable. It's like a computer but unlike any computer. This is the new iPad Pro. [ Applause ] >> The new iPad Pro, it's such a huge leap forward for iPad, and for computers. Now of course, like all of our products, every iPad Pro is made in ways that are good for both our customers and for the environment. And in fact, the excess aluminum that was created in the process of making these iPad Pro enclosures is recycled back into the material that's used in the MacBook Air and the Mac mini. The 11-inch iPad Pro is offered in these four storage options and it starts at $799. [ Applause ] And there is nothing else out there that comes close to this combination of performance and portability. The 12.9-inch iPad Pro is offered in these same storage options and it starts at $999. [ Applause ] And of course, both models are available in LTE configurations as well. Customers can start placing orders today and they're going to be showing up next week on the 7th. [ Applause ] Now, in addition to the new Pro, the current 10.5-inch Pro will continue to be available alongside the 6th-gen iPad and iPad mini 4. This is the new iPad Pro and we could not be more excited about it. Now back to Tim. [ Applause ] >> These are the most exciting iPads we have ever created. This doesn't just change the way we think about iPad, it changes the way we think about computers. Now, before we close out, I have one quick update -- iOS12 is off to an unbelievable start. It's been installed on more systems in the first month than any version in history. This is incredible. And it's remaining on a tear. In fact, an amazing 60% of all iOS devices out there are already running iOS12. This is just unheard of! And today, we're shipping 12.1. This update includes Group FaceTime, with up to 32 of your friends simultaneously -- as well as some other great new features, including dual-SIM support for iPhone X-S and iPhone X-R with eSIM. There's also over 70 great new emojis where you can express yourself any way you would like. This is the best iOS version ever. Check it out. [ Applause ] What a huge morning! The all-new MacBook Air thinner and lighter, now with Touch ID and this beautiful retina display. And our most loved Mac is now our greenest Mac. And the new Mac mini, it's the mightiest and most versatile Mac mini ever. And our Today at Apple sessions in our retail stores, designed to help our customers take their creativity even further. And the incredible new iPad Pro, with its beautiful all-screen design, chock-full of advanced features and the A12X Bionic, the most powerful chip we have ever created. You're going to be amazed by what you can do with this product. Now, at Apple, we love how people use our products to create truly wonderful things and put them out into the world. This has been our mission from the very beginning. We've always believed deeply in the power of creativity to change things, to push the human race forward. And it's such a great honor for us to be a part of what people create every day, all around the world. Now what better way to celebrate that creativity than with an amazing musical performance. I'd like to introduce an artist that's used her unique talent to make brilliant and evocative music that defies genre. The Apple music team is proud to have worked with her from the earliest days of her career, and she's gone on to sell over 15 million albums around the world. But most importantly, the creativity and emotional honesty of her work is undeniable. She is one of our favorites. So please join me in welcoming this New York native, the wonderfully talented Lana Del Rey! [ Applause ] >> Well, thank you so much. Thanks to Tim for asking us to come down and sing a couple of songs for you. I'm lucky enough to have Jack Antonoff with me, playing on the piano. [applause]. And I just wanted to say, we're really honored to be playing for Apple and it's a company that's done so much to change the way that we consume music but also, for people like me and Jack, the way that we make music and record, whether it's at home and in the studio. So with that, they told us not to swear so, for that reason, I can't tell you the name of the upcoming record that me and Jack made. But the first song that we're going to do from it is the last song we recorded for it, and it's called "How to Disappear." [ Music ] [ Applause ] Thank you so much. Again, in the name of swearing, I won't say the title of the second track. I'll call it Venice for now and it's a song we released a couple -- couple of weeks ago. [ Music ] [ Applause ] Thank you very much. [ Applause ] >> Lana Del Rey! [ Applause ] I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today in New York and everyone that's been watching online, and I'd like to thank everyone at Apple who made today possible and makes every day possible. It couldn't be done without you. We've got a hands-on area with these amazing products just down the road at One Hanson Place. We'll have people escort you over there. I encourage you to go try them out for yourselves. They are amazing! Thanks again. I may see you in your neighborhood. See ya'. [ Applause ] ♪♪ (kids giggling) Wake up, monster.

what is considered now a modern timeless pop classic Selena Gomez over the course of 10 years has been through many challenges and also many triumphs she finds herself today sitting here with a brand new album called rare and we're here to discuss it Selena hello hello that was really impressive I could do it I just don't want it [Music] Happy New Year happy new decade happy 2020 how did you feel in the context of knowing that you were stay in 2020 really hitting the ground running super fast like the album's out I know and it's barely gotten started and so I suppose in a weird way that means that you end the year with a sort of really mixed emotions like can you relax knowing that's coming I can yeah I mean this is four years of my life and I think I'm completely okay with releasing it but there had always been something that was preventing me or scaring me from doing it and I'm so glad that I followed that gut instinct because it's so crazy that every single moment counts down to literally loozy to love me and look at her now is out but we were still like the last day writing music that the song I personally think is gonna be one of our biggest as well it's just that's the kind of magic that happens and I and I know that happens with other artists but the people I'm surrounded by it just happens and I'm so grateful plus the songs pretty awesome yeah I mean and it seems to me like good people were the difference this time no disrespect to Hewitt with before but it feels like you really chose your collaborators very deliberately on this hour yeah well I think my role thank you I think my role you know has been I don't want to work with anyone who doesn't want to work with me hmm I think I just found my group and I think I'm getting better and better but I only know that that that means it's because of the people I'm surrounded by that inspired me that challenged me and I think the past few years or hell decade if you want I think I was really kind of hurting and I think that prevented me from doing a lot more creatively or even content-wise what I wanted to say I'm interested and I went I was in the studio last night like I actually just kinda wanna keep going which I never do now I get to have more say - when it comes to even putting the music chill I was always so scared to speak up with producers now I know most of them so well that I just give them [ __ ] and I'm always just like well I don't you know i-i've never done that really before I to have a conversation and it was an important experience for me were there times when you were making the record during that four years when you were like you say in pain where you wondered whether or not you would ever get another album or body of work out or that it would take even longer than it has the you wanted to throw in the towel and maybe just walk away from that process maybe but I was under contract so maybe but when I would have those moments it never lasted it was almost like I'd had the low moment and be like no forget I gotta like keep going I've got to now I feel like I need to say something and then there's period where I don't have anything to say and it just would pick up quickly when I needed it to happen who was some of the people that you aside from your collaborators that the small group of people that you kind of I suppose went to to say is this good like am I on the right path am I making sense I'm like am i speaking my truth is it good enough I didn't I didn't have anyone listen it needed to be something that I liked for you to take on that that challenge to a degree yourself was going through this challenging time like that that can be you know ultimately fulfilling but at the time I'm sure there were lonely moments you know were you like you say that makes the doubt even more kind of privileged doesn't it when you come on your own trying to work out navigate your way through this the static to find some clarity of vision a I reinstate to say that I I was sad it's like whatever but I think to me it's it's such a distant thought hmm I'm not in that place anymore and I think maybe before I used to lie and say that so that people would get it but I kind of show everything that I'm feeling in my face yeah but it's it's not even like I can't even go anymore if I try it it just doesn't seem like it's a part of me anymore any of those ties soul ties are mental stuff everything going on it's I'm it's all of its under control and this is where I'm going and I see it very clearly so there's a lot of liberation on this record mmm and even the moments when you know you're diving into subject matter to resolve it for yourself it feels like you're doing so with the purpose of trying to get to a place a liberated place and so I wonder you know at the end of the process what you what did you let go of what did you no longer need in your life once you'd kind of been through this process of writing this album and getting out the other side well I definitely had to get probably the most toxic thing out of my life first then it started becoming being being a bit more vocal I am naturally a people pleaser so just more kind of saying no this isn't what I'm going to do I started noticing you know people were putting that were like setting up sessions it seemed like favors or something it just it kind of got confusing for me and I think that's why I tend to one of the many reasons why I tend to just always go with and Julia and Justin trust loyalty trust understanding don't give a [ __ ] about the industry then believe in the art and believe in music and believe in what I'm saying I have the greatest label I'm so grateful for John and all of that that's not really what I'm describing I guess it's just it is weird and especially being in the position that I'm a now as a pop artist it is harder when it's like oh we're having all these things because we think you should sound like this yeah I learned a lot this past year about how to navigate that so when you write a lyric like people go from people you know to people you don't surely that's like a great moment for you among will you recognize that's just a part of humanity that one's funny because it was actually my friend Liz was her friend that had the hook until it was actually Brandon because it came out of nowhere take it which was really fun yeah everyone goes to it you know we go through seasons people are meant to be in your life or some others they're not I think if you accept that though that's ultimately positive thing isn't it when you realize that if you stop holding on so tight yeah to the idea he did change I mean I kind of still do but every time I'm on the other side I'm like oh I get it thank you for that one needed that what did you get like what do you get from when you come out of this I what do you recognize what do you realize what do you know for me okay a good example is I would say it's about eight ten years it was really painful and I think when lose you to love me came out and the reaction it got I definitely knew it was a special song I didn't know that it was gonna become so first number one people responded to in such a huge way I think when that happened I had a moment where I said I completely get it the agony the confusion the self-doubt all of that wrapped up into that song that was a moment where I got it I got I needed that I went through that for something like this for other people and that was a really special moment I can't think of anyone who's lived the kind of life you've lived and you still any 27 years old it to be launching a music career at 17 with what you'd already done and then to go through the process of growth and identifying and understanding who you are all in the space of the public eye and you worked the whole time how hard was it to find a ballot was that to bring the biggest challenges find the balance between work and you cuz you didn't start working even when you were getting sick you still worked yeah I think I needed to because it kept me going mm-hmm so sometimes I pushed myself too far when I when I did have to take moments and step back I didn't find that it was is embarrassing or that I was letting myself down or letting fans down it meant that I I needed to make sure I didn't want it basically I didn't want to get to a certain age where it was almost too late that I didn't figure this stuff out and I had been going through all of these different emotions not specifically within relationships it's personal it's you know bigger than that it's people at home it's theirs there was a lot there and I'm grateful because it has brought me through all of it but I have this relationship with my job and my work that keeps me going I know it's kind of stupid but I always say to my fans that they have saved me from a lot of situations you know you're built up just for them to knock you down it keeps going it's gonna keep happening but what stayed consistent in my life was that and because of social media which I'm able to have more of an intimate relationship with them and that's you know my I draw my boundaries to a specific point but it's literally people that I've known for years and that meant so much to me so do you sometimes go and read things and dial into the timeline when no one knows just to kind of see what people you don't do that yeah I didn't have social media for Kier's you mentioned that you had to been on social media at the start of the last conversation we had and I kind of wished that we'd sort of dive in a little bit more into that because I just out of a pure personal never want to know what that's like like what it's like when you don't look at it because I still find myself i screen time still creeps up I still find myself owning that habit I don't know you just got to do it my eye I was driving myself crazy first off there was a million things that I didn't want to see yeah and I would see them over and over and over again yeah then I'm comparing then I'm looking at these people and I'm like how did it it just it's all the things that people say right it's nothing new it's that you usually sum times Felix you have FOMO everyone's life looks amazing and that happens to me too I'm like well what am I not like I'm missing the plot here like write some things how come it's so fun for everyone else then it just started getting dark like there were accounts that were dissecting me down to my body to my face and my features choices I've made telling stories and it drove me crazy because I don't I honestly just wanted to be like none of you are qualified like no no if you even know what you're talking about and it just destroyed me so I stopped and I tell every single person everything changed yeah and I'm also I'm also I'm living in that time where there's a specific look that's going on within females so that would get in my head as well you know yeah I do look young so there's nothing I can do about that of course I am 27 but sometimes I'm like oh I look like a baby which is stupid and I don't fit into that look which isn't a bad thing and it's not bad that that's what people enjoy and like it's whatever makes you feel comfortable of course but like when I was out of social media I was so much happier with with just me myself how I looked and that helped a lot during those reflective times you know when you're getting into a place and you you find yourself going into a personal space where you can just have the freedom to think about what you want not be distracted what's the one thing the prevailing question or prevailing anchor you kept coming back to that you knew you had to get through I just needed to let my old self go I was purging multiple different things but it was specifically how I who I was then I would like to say that this is a fresh start and I started with this album but I I'm gonna continue to just do better and do everything I can to make it great I mean it's a it's a complete human experience this album from start to finish you know it starts with a song called rare and which is just a I mean I've never heard that a song I love with that that actually is a word that's sums up what the purpose of my position is which is letting people know that they are completely unique within who they are so that's the biggest thing right it's like they don't fit in or they feel like they need to be a certain way and who are they looking up to is very scary also to know who they're looking up to him and I think it was such a perfect description of how I think girls or women are meant to feel you know it's it's it's even acknowledging I don't have it all but I do know that I'm worth something I'm not gonna settle and I'm gonna wait because there is something out there though that is gonna give me that feeling that I deserve and that I want you to get the best out of your collaborators in the best out of each experience in a recording studio you know you have to be as honest and open with each other as possible how was that for you knowing that you were gonna dredge up details and examples and stories and even people and even people by name and share that with people in a trusted environment like I don't see how you could have made rear without doing that the subject matter on the record as well as you as well as you're hiding and keeping it to yourself and letting us work it out I figure you got to go there to be able to to dress it up different it would be they didn't even need to it didn't even needed to be booked said yeah and it's not because I wanted any sort of spotlight on that situation if anything I'm wanting the spotlight completely separated yeah but it wasn't in a vindictive way it was simply like okay I actually have my part to say and I waited I wasn't just you know rationally doing something to just be like coming from a place of well yeah like I'm over it that that's not where I was when it all came together it just felt right and I was okay with that other than the fact that they pay attention a bit more to my personal life than maybe others it's gonna be you know it's gonna be gone in a day there's gonna be another story there's gonna be something else so people will ultimately know yes where the inspiration came from but then it kind of ends there moving away from any particular individual and just talking about the concept of having a normal human relationship as long as you've been interested in forming any kind of bond with anyone it's been visible for the most part you know and I just I figured that's got to distort at some point your concept of what a normal relationship is or what the possibilities are whether you acknowledge that at some point and decided no I need to get back to a place where this recognize this is just an unusual and strange environment well I can be honest of course always it is so cliche it's just everyone dates everyone it's so it always seems to be within a little bubble and and it's because it's safe right it's you know you're you're wanting someone to understand what you're going through you're you're almost wanting a counterpart of creativity as well and it's you know interesting and fun but the problem with that is that you end up the whether you admit it or not you're having a relationship for four people and not even for yourself there's almost this point where it's like oh we're we're making it known that we're together or whatever who you know whatever it is it's like you just need to decide within our world it fits for you or is it for show yeah right is the song on the record it comes in second which is in a pants again which is you know borderline kind of house techno throw yourself on the dance floor that's so much fun and and what's cool about it is it it has all the emotion that you want from a right dance record it's not just this kind of like bolster as' hands in the air bang I like cliche right it's like nah man it draws you in and it makes you really think it gave you a moat when you listen to it and you'll a moat when you dance to it which i think is the perfect kind of dance music yeah and and it kind of complemented vulnerable because when we when we wrote the record it was very we were just talking about the next kind of chapter of when I step into meeting someone it's like if I were to give you all of these things are you able to do that I expect that if not I'm totally okay letting that go but I'm still gonna remain vulnerable I'm still going to remain open and okay with my emotions okay with being pissed or sad or upset about it so it kind of complemented that dance again is saying I'm able to get back to that was that it that's Justin come and sit down let's talk about this record and dive into it [Music] and welcome back as you heard Selena Gomez is releasing a brand new album which is called rare we're now joined for part two by her steamed colleagues Justin treinta Julie Michael was great to see like good afternoon this is part of a loyalty Crew hell yeah this is part of the crew that if I may say someone who not just be you're honest with me I'll be honest with you up until revival I can't say I was an expert in Selena Gomez as a musician yeah it was your collaboration as the three of you that really got my attention yeah it was when I felt like oh wow there's something really unique going on here and there's like my favorite kind of subversion which is taking what I thought I knew about somebody and ripping it to shreds I loved that love - I said that to me 2015 was when it kind of started for me and I wonder what those kind of first days for you guys were like and how you got to a place where you could start to rip it to shreds I mean I'll just be personally my intro to Selena came from from this little booboo I was in a band for a long time which we've talked about many times but when I first started writing songs with and for other people she was like the first clogger I met who was like oh you want to talk about really weird and she and Selena had already worked together and she was like Selena likes to talk about weird too and so then you also just wanted to talk about real yeah you know what yeah it's so exciting you know for writers like us who want to write only from honest opinions and I think that they made it okay for me you know I don't like going in and felt like I go in and I'm like we usually talk for hours just about everything right and then usually we pick up things like I think you understand the ways of like a room when it comes to writing it's like the more that we talk about the more detail we go into the more it's easy for us to write about yeah and I like you know obviously it takes the level of comfort and a level of trust but you are pretty much an open book like you'll go like this is what's happening please help me make art out of my misery yeah basically yeah it was at that point I think when we had started working it just felt so natural and it felt like they believed in what I was saying not that anyone around me didn't it just it was able to take it to a place where I was so excited about the music this meant more you know and I let and I loved revival and what we did with that but then you know transitioning into what we did it's a lot more stuff to untangle - yeah it's more pain yeah right about yeah I have to ask because you seem really well and really healthy and I want to and you've got friends in the couch now so you know you've been you've been dealt with some really some real challenges with with your health and after you met Justin and Julia he went through one of those again in a significant way and and I think she had to ask Justin Julia like when Selena came back to word like came back - right did you notice a difference that you feel there was a change in the way she approached her music after she'd been faced with that we've always been so close and so honest with each other but I did definitely see you in this album like what you mentioned before that Kurt confidence and like what the album should be and what the music should be your confidence definitely like she was always like this is what I want to talk about this is what's happening but this time it was like more melodies were coming directly from her more production ideas were coming directly from her so that that whether that was more journal entries more info journal answer is it related do you think you think you came out of that going you know I well first off I'm a huge advocate for mental health um I have this dream of mine that's you know beyond all of this where I think that personally it should be required in schools to be taught dialectical behavior therapy there is something I read where and you know I think it was the 50 is the 14 year old kids of today have the same anxiety and depression as a 40 year old in the 50s that says so much and I don't know why that perhaps doesn't shake people up a bit to where maybe there should be more that accessible I am glad that it is being discussed more I'm glad that we are having the conversation but it does it saved my life yeah 1000% I need to know yeah and stopping to know that it might have been bigger than something I could control and I think to what Justin was saying it is it is a huge part of how I was able to release it and let it go and sometimes we would just even write songs that were like just to purge things out and like that's never gonna see the light of day but it's just you know that verse is not allowed to ever see things that I love that process I love the fact that you're willing to go in there and kind of clear out the tank before you actually get down to the pure stuff yes well you don't even know you're doing it you just like okay let's write this thing saying whatever whatever we're saying and then you kind of you finish and you're like okay that was really fun but no one can ever hear that for whatever reason right wait wait that's a good word fun we've covered some heavy ground in this right but this is a fun wreck which is fun songs on this rig there's one cool fun yeah of course it is I mean that's just man okay we'll get to fun in a second but I have to say like you love words and you love words like that is a perfect marriage and so when you guys first connected and start doing it it must have been fantastic and also to move into this album to like what's one of your favorite songwriting moments on this record the two of you you think if you can find a common one lose you to love me happened when I had come home from tour it was on Valentine's Day that we wrote it and I think that's probably when I was a powerful moment on Valentine's Day yeah right and it was also our first time seeing you and so long so I got that I think was just one of my favorites just because we were all like reunited again yeah and doing it again and we had you being what were you coming back from it's a treatment center mmm Wow and so when you walked in that room did you have a line or an inkling or an emotion of that you knew you had to cover or did you just let it happen naturally well usually Julia texts me it's kind of like how it works when everyone's kind of getting in the studio when she asked me I felt it was kind of overdone the the subject and I just said I'm sorry that this is what I'm gonna give you but I'm still not fully done with this she's like got it and so when I walked in and it was literally just the piano and the chorus and a bit of the first verse and I just like sat there and I tell people this too because it was also such a very raw moment a I had just gotten back but B we were in the bright daylight you know and that's not normally how you're maybe talking about something like that and then you know Julie had to leave what we did the second verse and then you guys did the bridge yeah without me but okay we know these lyrics are great for the bridge just on the outro but like we need your approval on the melody because even though she's the queen of words she also made some of the best melodies louis and she was like yet approved it was very quick I feel like the ones that come the quickest for us are usually the ones that feel the most right yes we're not overthinking it and we're just in it yeah it's a human album like I said it's a human album it covers a lot of ground of what it is to kind of feel a lot of things from the very deep right through to the frivolous you know and and there is equally important as each other yeah they can't live deep all the time you go crazy sometimes you just need to write a song like like crowded room there is this this married couple that I'm friends with they're older and they're awesome and they had told me this story which was really sweet very cheesy but adorable they do a lot socially so they're in rooms a lot or with a lot of people and one of their things that they do is that they're not always together which I love I admire they're like we don't really stay in every moment we go and do our own thing and throughout the night or day or whatever they're doing they'll just kind of make eye contact and do this and then turn away which means you're you're my number one and it's just a check-in and it's kind of cheesy but I thought that was cool and so the the concept of of crowded room and and it feeling you know that it's just you you two it's very romantic and it's fun and then to get black on it was awesome yeah I mean I you've picked your collaborators brilliantly I mean why did black come to mind I mean apart from being a great melodic writer and a fantastic artist so we we had discussed features and at first I don't I didn't want any yeah we were kind of going through what you know who would a want to do it but would sound great and compliment for me it's his tone and and and his like it's his voice as well so it's kind of the rapping part but it's the singing so I was blown away when I got his cut cuz obviously they go and do their thing and so it was awesome except for her Cuddy thing I mean the Cuddy thing sounds like it was far more of a genuine an old-school collaboration yes how did that come about I have to ask him he's one of the cornerstone artists at that time yes so I went into the studio with Emenike and Madison everyone was kind of saying maybe we should do up-tempo and and I said I don't know let's try something acoustic messed around with that I didn't like that didn't work we scratched the idea and I kinda got exhausted so I said I want to do something weird like Kid Cudi and I mean under compliment then I didn't know what that was gonna be so we were listening to different sounds but I I just had that melody when they were saying what's what does that mean you know and I'm like something where he's he's so good at storytelling but changing it up with every line it almost has a character to it and so that was when he does a very distinctive melancholic Sansa yeah I mean it's very there you know you know you're listening to you know that's when the melody came about where it has that kind of singsong like playground type of chorus and so we had nothing to it it was just that then we did the verses and my ANR came in I said this is who inspired it and you know how do you like it I was really excited about it and without my permission which will never happen again because I was I have a major fear of rejection and so I think they know that I also don't it's not take advantage it's just like I'm scared to ask artists especially certain artists that are particular so someone sent the record to his management apparently he had heard it that exact day and he loved it so then they told me and I remember exactly how it went down I was like why it's just like oh my gosh just think no you're kidding and then I was like how how the hell did he know and then it was that moment where I found out and it was kind of like yes okay amazing I'm so excited it's just so quiet no it was a bit of just I was a little annoyed but it was perfect and so he wanted to have a phone call and that's when I had told him as far as production wise I said I would trust you on this you know I've built this part up and if you like it I know kind of of course I know your ability and what you can see so I would actually love to know what you feel and hear what you feel for the record then he came to LA and we were in the studio for two days it was very very scary at one point because giving cutting notes is like the scariest thing in the world to me but I had ideas for the intro and stuff and his response to that made me feel so comfortable because it ended up working and it was so great that it happened that way surely you you can finish off an experience like and it gets you somewhere closer to not being so scared to ask yeah trust in yourself more because you've got two of the best riders in the world on your team and you got Cuddy jetway McManus is that too much she doesn't like compliments I love them by the way one of the greatest songwriters of our generation and his sidekick on your team it's I guess I'm trying to get it and I don't want to become across as overly concerned or patronizing but yeah through all the achievements of your life and all the work you've done the work and everything that journey you've been on 227 a very pivotal year an important yeah surely now you can think about this album and the kind of people that ride for you on this album and want to be a part of it based on the quality the music but also just what an honest and genuine person you are does that resonate now are you able to acknowledge and appreciate that I think that's how I've continued to have a career is that I'm very okay with speaking about that I'm speaking about myself through that I think that's truly what has sustained me and I don't do it purposefully I'd do it because it's necessary for me I came from Disney who I have the utmost respect for and has you know that they changed my life but when you're coming from a machine like that you end up losing a bit of that vulnerability because you are meant to carry something which is carrying that brand and making sure that you are being a respectful person that families are okay with and that kids can look up to and so I I had dealt with that for so long that I had been conditioned and one I chose to do Spring Breakers that was a huge moment you know and I it was very controversial and you know it was it was definitely one of those moments but it just it slowly happened where I didn't want to have to be okay I needed to say something because it got to a point where everyone else was saying something and that would drive me crazy so that's why I'm always really adamant by saying if it doesn't come directly from me it's definitely most of the time 90% of the time not true I was able to gain control of that and I think that's when everything real started happening for me and good for you was the starting point for music in that world without sacrificing vulnerability is the important point and that's why that song is so important on the record yep it's it's in your album to me deliberately it's the centerpiece of doubt my thing that's all thank you and I think that that that message that you're saying there of like all right even through all of that like I'm still gonna be that person that's gonna lay it on the line right but now I have expectations where it's like if I were to do this or if I were to give you are you strong enough are you capable of being someone that's gonna be in my life that's how I approach things now and I'm not being conceited I'm saying it's actually an honor to be with me because I think I'm a great person and I love people deeply and I won't tolerate ever being treated the way that I had been that's the song it's not just me being like I'm still vulnerable it's like well I am but I need these things for you to get that from me what was the most going down the line what's the most fun or memorable experience you had working on this project with Selina on react there was a couple I mean even though oh well look at her now was a really really fun day that was a super fun day I had just come back from seeing this one perform in San Diego and it was just like if anyone tells you they know a songs a hit that they're liar but you know wanting to feel special when you're writing it right it's like we knew like you know started playing the track you know when you're writing a song where the the chorus is mmm that's a that's a fun time that was really fun and kind of just like telling you know that was now however many months after we wrote lose you to love me and it was like this feeling of like no but actually like look at her now there's no one's crying today like business can find like it was so that was a really cool moment and we hadn't been all three of us with Ian since we did that liar so that was like so I lose you to love me was the first time us and Batman and Robin had been together in a long time and then mm and Robin did hands to myself so then this was the first time we were back with Ian so it's like kind of like both times bringing different pastas back together yeah and that was a really really fun day and I think I already had like two glasses of wine before I got there was just always makes life better yeah I was so fun it was so fun it was almost like I don't even think we were objectively like trying to be strategic like we're gonna make this song about this it was just that yeah yeah that was really fun yeah so then do you have one that jumps out that really kind of that you'll carry with you or that you think about this album now it's done and it's out and it's ours for you let it go completely like is there one kind of really special memory that you'll carry with you from the experience well what did intuit julius said definitely lose you I had an amazing time working on vulnerable the conversation that led up to what the song is and and the meaning behind it was really fun for me and special then look at her no fun was actually fun was but it was a good time yeah it was like kind of the first time when we had gone in the studio after a while where you were kind of like I don't really want to talk about anything that I'm going through anymore you're like I've done it I feel like I've done all those songs on my record you were like I just want to do something fun and I was like well okay literally like let's write a song that says fun great because it is ultimately right that's what's brought us all here together is it's fun to listen to even the hard stuff and it's fun to make and that's the trade yeah that's that's the ultimate trade you get the process we get the result you get to take what you've learned from it and apply it to your life we get to take what you've made from it and apply it to ours yeah and it's this magic trade that's been going on for so long and it never gets tired because every experience is unique for you even the songs that are sad or whatever you still have so much fun in the projects still so cathartic and magical and right yeah completely know and her bravery in the honesty in the music it also goes through everything you were talking about like how you get so scared to ask people for features and stuff my version of that is all the activism and fundraising to do I get so scared to ask people I work with you to do things and I came to studio one day and I have just gotten a phone call that I was gonna receive the ACLU award and I was like just telling her cuz I was so excited because I was an activist that's like the dream for an award and without even questioning she's like well so what can I do and I was like why like what can I do and it's like do you want to present me with the award and she was like yeah where it's like so it's like that you don't get that with you know we are very lucky to work with lots of amazing people but like this friendship is it's a pretty special thing and like I was like oh I don't have to ask for a feature which is my version of a feature it was like I just told her I to you if she were just like I'm I'll be there just tell me when and she like had to move a bunch of for me and she was there you did the same thing for my show yeah we're working on fun I was like I'm performing in LA and you're really oh my god I want to come she's like can I sing with you it was like I think she's doing you a favor she's just inviting yourself to waiters all the time not like she's doing a favor it's just like what people it's extending its extending the experience so it's and you can tell that it's just now become that and I think what's what I also want to say that's super important is I know well everyone knows that they have already on their own done insane huge monumental music where you know and I'm I'm very honored that they have chosen to be a part of moments like this with me because they mean a lot to me but it's it's also it's also them separately that makes all of it great you know our we were there when Julia was literally saying I would never be an artist like would you really do what you know really surround stuff no I would never do it then she had this song that she'd played and I was called issues I think you were like I was maybe gonna give it to someone and you're like I'm just gonna keep it and me hidden just and really she's like just keep it me like put it out like you're just gonna like keep it away from the world no like what I got was my voice on it it's like we were so excited we even have a video that you have where I think it was at the moment it came out I think it was like the day came out and we like we're all in those studios so excited but you know her single came out and to be a part of that has been incredible as well I mean you say we've done incredible things but like a lot of the things that I've done have been because of you like I've had my first platinum record with you my first number one song on the radio with you like you've been so many of my firsts I'm I'm just as grateful for you as we've learned a lot today over the course of this two-part interview we've been through triumph and tribulation a decade past that hopefully will never be dredged up and discussed again and a fresh start at 2020 with the new album called rare which promises so much and delivers even more but before we go we have one more all-important question for the fans in 2016 255 dates and you towards faithfully then I'm revival and I look back on your timeline now I'm amazed you did it I can't believe you found the strength to be able to do that to it but you did it so your work ethic is right up there thank you but you decade are you gonna tour are you feeling excited about playing live do you want to do it it's my favorite thing besides film it's my favorite thing in the entire world is actually connecting and having moments with everyone because it's theirs they've they've taken what I have and have made it theirs and to see physically what that means to people brings me to tears every time it's also mind-blowing that I am in a space with that many people as far as doing it within this year I think I need to find ways where that's possible for me and that's just about the pace and and and you know I'm gonna do something hopefully that's just not as typical and I hope it's not I don't I don't want people to think it's lazy but I just don't think some of the production and things like that need to be as big as they were for me personally I think my favorite part is just like talking to them and sometimes all that other stuff is a distraction from who I actually a.m. yeah so I think I would do it differently and I do want to so we'll see I mean I hope you're proud of the record you should be yeah you know I mean to get to where you've got to over the course of I think from 2015 to now that's the arc that's the arc that I see yeah and I hear on this record and so you know start to finish super tasteful really honest really straight-up album and you said you wanted to keep going are you gonna keep creating yeah straight back in I mean I was in last year last night I don't know yeah but it's always casual it's like it's usually available then we'll do it and if everyone wants to then we'll do it maybe some outtakes maybe some first verses and purchases have you see the light of day one day I'm particularly brave an honest moment yeah I've already been pretty honest you are an honest human being well I really appreciate that it's always more fun when someone's willing to take to move into an environment where they tell their truth but never it's sacrificed if their own well-being and I think you do that really well thanks to your time appreciatively get the best audio experience with new

with the latest news so as we know smartphones are evolving they've sort of hit their peak and well samsung is about to ignite the next big super cycle replacement which is said to be the foldable smartphones samsung is without a doubt leading this game and it's time to get everyone on board according to the recent report from october of this year samsung display will start supplying foldable oled panels to google xiaomi and vivo furthermore in early next year samsung will also be supplying its oled display to oppo and oneplus this means that we could see a swarm of foldable smartphones from multiple brands possibly by the end of this year and in 2022. the report doesn't mention apple but the biggest apple analyst aka mingxiko recently said that it's decided that samsung will be the exclusive foldable oled supplier for apple's upcoming foldable iphone in his report he further mentioned that apple is aiming big bigger than samsung has ever aimed they're aiming to launch about 15 to 20 million foldable iphone units in 2023 a number that is far bigger than samsung's 7 million units that they have allegedly planned for this year's foal 3 and z flip 3 combined apple is also expected to use the nanowire solution to its flexible oled screen which is said to be superior to samsung's why octa solution when it comes to usage is concerned ming chico further says that apple could be the biggest winner of foldable smartphone war because of the insane software and hardware plus third-party app optimization control they have the third-party app issue still persists even after two generations of samsung's foldable smartphone so this control of software and hardware will give apple a big boost i can't wait to see what all these other brands will bring to the table with their foldable smartphones and yeah it's going to be the next big war also in the news samsung has made a major announcement that they will be announcing a brand new 50 megapixel iso cell sensor that is marketed as iso cell for everyone this sensor is said to have 0.7 micrometer pixel size and is said to rely on the latest software technologies from samsung such as the dual pixel pro technology as well as iso pro for that improved low light performance judging from the marketing tag line it's definitely going to be provided to a lot of other smartphone manufacturers and some people are expecting that this might be the sensor that we could see on the pixel 6 pro previous leaks have said that google has used the imx 800 sensor for their pvt units but it might also be this new smartphone sensor that samsung is about to announce so either way pixel 6 pro is getting a huge camera hardware jump thanks to either sony or samsung so that's all the latest news the traditional smartphone is about to transform apple is aiming big and soon enough samsung will face the toughest competition but for now they're gonna move the industry and provide their oled panels to other smartphone brands let me know your thoughts in the comments section below with that being said i'll catch you guys later peace out welcome to brent's apple store holy crap [Music] all right so ben i

people are in some kind
of mental, psychological, emotional pain. PRINCE HARRY:
What words have you heard
around mental health? -Crazy?
-Lost it.
Can't keep it together. OPRAH: It's that stigma
of being labelled "the other." The telling of the story,
being able to say, "This is what happened to me,"
is crucial. (rapping)
See, I write stories.
I write them on my arm. Only I can read them,
but the doctor calls it
self-harm. So can somebody tell me
it's okay not to be okay? And do not tell me quietly, because mental health matters, and that's the reality! Just sitting down
and listening to somebody, there's joy in that. I can put a smile on but inside feel
completely broken. STEFANI: I don't tell this story
from my own self-service. I've been through it,
and people need help. It's just something I accepted. (speaks native language) PRINCE HARRY:
To make that decision
to receive help is not a sign of weakness. In today's world,
more than ever, it is a sign of strength. MAN: People that acknowledge
their mental health struggles, they're really like superheroes. I just froze, and I just-- OPRAH:
In front of us is a human being
who's suffering. Treating people with dignity
is the first act. I think it's our natural state
to be connected. MAN:
Fawzi and his friends
are heroes. I really, truly believe
that they are heroes. (laughter) The results of this year
will be felt for decades. The kids, families, husbands, wives, everybody. If we're gonna hurt,
we're gonna hurt together. Wolf, wolf, hunt them far and

their solemn oaths this ceremony is the culmination of 244 years of a democracy it is the moment when leaders brought to this stage by the will of the people promised to be faithful to our constitution to cherish it and defend it it is the moment when they become as we all should be guardians of our country have we become too jaded too accustomed to the ritual of the passing of the georgia democracy to truly appreciate what a blessing and a privilege it is to witness this moment i think not two weeks ago when an angry violent mob staged an insurrection and desecrated this temple of our democracy it awakened us to our responsibilities as americans this is the day when our democracy picks itself up brushes off the dust and does what america always does goes forward as a nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all this conveyance of a sacred trust between our leaders and our people takes place in front of this shining capital dome for a reason when abraham lincoln gave his first inaugural address in front of this capitol the dome was only partially constructed braced by ropes of steel he promised he would finish it he was criticized for spending funds on it during the civil war to those critics he replied if the people see the capital going on it is a sign we intend the union shall go on and it did and it will generations of americans gave their lives to preserve our republic in this place great legislation to protect civil rights and economic security and lead the world was debated and crafted under this dome now it falls on all of us not just the two leaders we are inaugurating today to take up the torch of our democracy not as a weapon of political arson but as an instrument for good we pledge today never to take our democracy for grant remarkable strength we celebrate its resilience its grit we celebrate the ordinary people doing extraordinary things for our nation the doctors and nurses on the front line of this pandemic the officers in the capitol a new generation never giving up hope for justice we celebrate a new president joe biden who vows to restore the soul of america and cross the river of our divides to a higher plane and we celebrate our first african-american first asian american and first woman vice president kamala harris who stands on the shoulders of so many on this platform who have forged the way to this day when she takes the oath of office little girls and boys across the world will know that anything and everything is possible and in the end that is america our democracy a country of so much good and today on these capital steps and before this glorious field of flags we rededicate ourselves to its cause thank you it is now my honor to introduce to you the senator who has worked with me and so many others to make this ceremony possible my friend and the chair of the inaugural committee missouri senator roy blunt well i should have known when senator klobuchar got involved at least there'd be a touch of snow up here this morning of all the things we'd considered i don't think snow was on my agenda until i walked out the door a moment ago but thank you senator klobuchar and thanks to the other members of the joint congressional committee on the inauguration as we officially begin the 59th inaugural ceremony i also want to thank the joint committee staff and our partners particularly our security partners for the they the way they've dealt with unprecedented circumstances when i chaired the inauguration four years ago i shared president reagan's 1981 description of this event as commonplace and miraculous commonplace because we've done it every four years since 1789 miraculous because we've done it every four years since 1789. americans have celebrated this moment during war during depression and now during pandemic once again all three branches of our government come together as the constitution envisions once again we renew our commitment to our determined democracy forging a more perfect union that theme for this inauguration our determined democracy forging a more perfect union was announced by the joint committee before the election with the belief that the united states can only fulfill its promise and set an example for others if we are always working to be better than we have been the constitution established that determined democracy with its first three words declaring the people as the source of the government the articles of confederation hadn't done that the magna carta hadn't done that only the constitution says the government exists because the people are the source of the reason it exists they immediately followed those first three words with the words to form a more perfect union the founders did not say to form a perfect union they did not claim that in our new country nothing would need to be improved fortunately they understood that always working to be better would be the hallmark of a great democracy the freedoms we have today the nation we have today is not here just because it happened and they aren't complete a great democracy working through the successes and failures of our history striving to be better than it had been and we are more than we have been and we are less than we hope to be the assault on our capital at this very place just two weeks ago reminds us that a government designed to balance and check itself is both fragile and resilient during the last year the pandemic challenged our free and open society and called for extraordinary determination and sacrifice and still challenges us today meeting that challenge head on have been and are health care workers scientists first responders essential frontline workers and so many others we depend on in so many ways today we come to this moment people all over the world as we're here are watching and we'll watch what we do here our government comes together the congress and the courts joined the transition of executive responsibility one political party more pleased today and on every inaugural day than the other but this is not a moment of division it's a moment of unification a new administration begins and brings with it a new beginning and with that our great national debate goes forward and a determined democracy will continue to be essential in pursuit of a more perfect union and a better future for all americans what a privilege for me to join you today thank you [Applause] i'm pleased to call to the podium a longtime friend of the president-elect and his family father leo o'donovan to lead us in an invocation please stand if you are able and remain standing for the national anthem and the pledge to our flag thank you gracious and merciful god at this sacred time we come before you in need indeed on our knees but we come still more with hope and with our eyes raised anew to the vision of a more perfect union in our land a union of all our citizens to promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity we are a people of many races creeds and colors national backgrounds cultures and styles now far more numerous and on land much vaster than when archbishop john carroll wrote his prayer for the inauguration of george washington 232 years ago archbishop carroll prayed that you o creator of all would assist with your holy spirit of counsel and fortitude the president of these united states that his administration may be conducted in righteousness and be eminently useful to your people today we confess our past failures to live according to our vision of equality inclusion and freedom for all yet we resolutely commit still more now to renewing the vision to caring for one another in word and deed especially the least fortunate among us and so becoming a light for the world there is a power in each and every one of us that lives by turning to every other one of us a thrust of the spirit to cherish and care and stand by others and above all those most in need it is called love and its path is to give ever more of itself today it is called american patriotism born not of power and privilege but of care for the common good with malice toward none and with charity for all for our new president we beg of you the wisdom solomon sought when he knelt before you and prayed for an understanding heart so that i can govern your people and know the difference between right and wrong we trust in the counsel of the letter of james if any of you lacks wisdom you should ask god who gives generously to all without finding fault and it will be given to you pope francis has reminded us how important it is to dream together by ourselves he wrote we risk seeing mirages things that are not there dreams on the other hand are built together be with us holy mystery of love as we dream together help us under our new president to reconcile the people of our land restore our dream and

americans this is america's day this is democracy's day a day of history and hope of renewal and resolve through a crucible crucible for the ages america has been tested anew and america has risen to the challenge today we celebrate the triumph not of a candidate but of a cause the cause of democracy the people the will of the people has been heard and the will of the people has been heeded we've learned again that democracy is precious democracy is fragile at this hour my friends democracy has prevailed so now on this hallowed ground where just a few days ago violence sought to shake the capital's very foundation we come together as one nation under god indivisible to carry out the peaceful transfer of power as we have for more than two centuries as we look ahead in our uniquely american way restless bold optimistic and set our sights on the nation we know we can be and we must be i thank my predecessors of both parties for their presence here today i thank them from the bottom of my heart and i know and i know the resilience of our constitution and the strength the strength of our nation as does president carter who i spoke with last night who cannot be with us today but whom we salute for his lifetime in service i've just taken the sacred oath each of those patriots have taken the oath first sworn by george washington but the american story depends not on any one of us not on some of us but on all of us on we the people who seek a more perfect union this is a great nation we are good people and over the centuries through storm and strife in peace and in war we've come so far but we still have far to go we'll press forward with speed and urgency for we have much to do in this winter apparel and significant possibilities much to repair much to restore much to heal much to build and much to gain few people in our nation's history have been more challenged or found a time more challenging or difficult than the time we're in now once in a century virus that silently stalks the country has taken as many lives in one year as america lost in all of world war ii millions of jobs have been lost hundreds of thousands of businesses closed a cry for racial justice some 400 years in the making moves us the dream of justice for all will be deferred no longer a cry for survival comes from planet itself a cry that can't be any more desperate or any more clear and now a rise of political extremism white supremacy domestic terrorism that we must confront and we will defeat to overcome these challenges to restore the soul and secure the future of america requires so much more than words requires the most elusive of all things in a democracy unity unity in another january on new year's day in 1863 abraham lincoln signed the emancipation proclamation when he put pen to paper the president said and i quote if my name ever goes down into history it'll be for this act and my whole soul is in it my whole soul is in it today on this january day my whole soul is in this bringing america together uniting our people united in our nation and i ask every american to join me in this cause uniting to fight the foes we face anger resentment and hatred extremism lawlessness violence disease joblessness and hopelessness with unity we can do great things important things we can right wrongs we can put people to work in good jobs we can teach our children in safe schools we can overcome the deadly virus we can reward reward work and rebuild the middle class and make health care secure for all we can deliver racial justice and we can make america once again the leading force for good in the world i know speaking of unity can sound to some like a foolish fantasy these days i know the forces that divide us are deep and they are real but i also know they are not new our history has been a constant struggle between the american ideal that we're all are created equal and the harsh ugly reality that racism nativism fear demonization have long torn us apart the battle is perennial and victory is never assured through civil war the great depression world war 9 11 through struggle sacrifice and setbacks our better angels have always prevailed in each of these moments enough of us enough of us have come together to carry all of us forward and we can do that now history faith and reason show the way the way of unity we can see each other not as adversaries but as neighbors we can treat each other with dignity and respect we can join forces stop the shouting and lower the temperature for without unity there is no peace only bitterness and fury no progress only exhausting outrage no nation only a state of chaos this is our historic moment of crisis and challenge and unity is the path forward and we must meet this moment as the united states of america if we do that i guarantee you we will not fail we have never ever ever ever failed in america we've acted together and so today at this time in this place let's start afresh all of us let's begin to listen to one another again hear one another see one another show respect to one another politics doesn't have to be a raging fire destroying everything in its path every disagreement doesn't have to be a cause for total war and we must reject the culture in which facts themselves are manipulated and even manufactured my fellow americans we have to be different than this america has to be better than this and i believe america is so much better than this just look around here we stand in the shadow of the capitol dome as was mentioned earlier completed amid the civil war when the union itself was literally hanging in the balance yet we endured we prevailed here we stand looking out on the great mall where dr king spoke of his dream here we stand we're 108 years ago at another inaugural thousands of protesters tried to block brave women marching for the right to vote and today we mark the swearing-in of the first woman in american history elected to national office vice president kamala harris don't tell me things can't change here we stand across the potomac from arlington cemetery where heroes who gave the last full measure of devotion rest and eternal peace and here we stand just days after a riotous mom thought they could use violence to silence the will of the people to stop the work of our democracy to drive us from this sacred ground it did not happen it will never happen not today not tomorrow not ever not ever all those who supported our campaign i'm humbled by the faith you place in us to all those who did not support us let me say this hear me out as we move forward take a measure of me and my heart if you still disagree so be it that's democracy that's america the right to dissent peaceably than the guard rails of our republic is perhaps this nation's greatest strength yet hear me clearly this agreement must not lead to this union and i pledge this to you i will be a president for all americans all americans [Applause] and i promise you i will fight as hard for those who did not support me as for those who did [Applause] many centuries ago saint augustine a saint of my church wrote that the people was a multitude defined by the common objects of their love defined by the common objects of their love what are the common objects we as americans love that define us as americans i think we know opportunity security liberty dignity respect honor and yes the truth recent weeks and months have taught us a painful lesson there is truth and there are lies lies told for power and for profit and each of us has a duty and a responsibility as citizens as americans and especially as leaders leaders who have pledged to honor our constitution and protect our nation to defend the truth and defeat the lies look i understand that many of my fellow americans view the future with fear and trepidation i understand they worry about their jobs i understand like my dad they lay it back wondering can i keep my health care can i pay my mortgage thinking about their families about what comes next i promise you i get it but the answer is not to turn inward to retreat into competing factions distrusting those who don't look like look like you or worship the way you do or don't get their news from the same sources you do we must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue rural versus ireland or rural versus urban conservative versus liberal we can do this if we open our souls instead of hardening our hearts if we show a little tolerance and humility and if we're willing to stand in the other person's shoes as my mom would say just for a moment stand in their shoes because here's the thing about life there's no accounting for what fate will deal you some days when you need a hand there are other days when we're called to lend a hand that's how it has to be that's what we do for one another and if we are this way our country will be stronger more prosperous more ready for the future and we can still disagree my fellow americans and the work ahead of us we're going to need each other we need all our strength to preserve to persevere through this dark winter we're entering what may be the toughest and deadliest period of the virus we must set aside politics and finally face this pandemic as one nation one nation and i promise you this as the bible says we be may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning we will get through this together together look folks all my colleagues i serve with in the house and the senate up here we all understand the world is watching watching all of us today so here's my message to those beyond our borders america has been tested and we've come out stronger for it we will repair our alliances and engage with the world once again not to meet yesterday's challenges but today's and tomorrow's challenges and will lead not merely by the example of our power but by the power of our example [Applause] we'll be a strong and trusted partner for peace progress and security look you all know we've been through so much in this nation and my first act as president i'd like to ask you to join me in the moment of silent prayer remember all those who we lost this past year to the pandemic those four hundred thousand fellow americans moms dads husbands wives sons daughters friends neighbors and co-workers we'll honor them by becoming the people and the nation we know we can and should be so i ask you let's say a silent prayer for those who've lost their lives and those left behind and for our country amen folks this is a time of testing we face an attack under democracy and on truth a raging virus growing inequity the sting of systemic racism a climate in crisis america's role in the world any one of these would be enough to challenge us in profound ways but the fact is we face them all at once presenting this nation with the one of the greatest responsibilities we've had now we're going to be tested are we going to step up all of us it's time for boldness for there's so much to do and this is certain i promise you we will be judged you and i by how we resolve these cascading crises of our era we will rise to the occasion is the question will we master this rare and difficult hour when we meet our obligations and pass along a new and better world to our children i believe we must i'm sure you do as well i believe we will and when we do we'll write the next great chapter in the history of the united states of america the american story a story that might sound something like a song that means a lot to me it's called american anthem there's one verse that stands out at least for me and it goes like this the work and prayers of century have brought us to this day what shall be our legacy what will our children say let me know in my heart when my days are through america america i gave my best to you let's add let's us add our own work and prayers to the unfolding story of our great nation if we do this then when our days are through our children and our children's children will save us they gave their best they did their duty they healed the broken land my fellow americans i closed the day where i began with the sacred oath before god and all of you i give you my word i will always level with you i will defend the constitution i'll defend our democracy i'll defend america and i'll give all all of you keep everything you i do in your service thinking not of power but of possibilities not a personal interest but the public good and together we shall write an american story of hope not fear of unity not division of light not darkness a story of decency and dignity love and healing greatness and goodness may this be the story that guides us the story that inspires us and the story that tells ages yet to come that we answer the call of history we met the moment democracy and hope truth and justice did not die in our watch but thrive that america secured liberty at home and stood once again as a beacon to the world that is what we owe our forebearers one another and generation to follow so with purpose and resolve we turn to those tasks of our time sustained by faith driven by conviction devoted to one another and the country we love with all our hearts may god bless america and may god protect our troops thank you [Applause] [Music] america [Applause] so [Applause] ladies and gentlemen please be seated ladies and gentlemen please welcome garth brooks to perform amazing grace [Music] [Music] [Music] me i was lost but now i'm fat was blind but now i see when we've been there ten thousand years bright and shiny as the sun we've known lesson days to sing god's praise then when we first begun i think ask you to sing this last verse with me not just the people here but the people at home who work as one united uh may sing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me i once was lost but now i'm found was blind but now i [Music] see [Applause] hard not to be reminded of [Applause] hard not to be reminded of president obama's singing that same song at the mother emanuel church a song that in our culture is as close to both poetry and prayer as you could possibly come and we're going to finish with those two things let me introduce amanda gorman our nation's first ever national poet laureate [Applause] mr president dr biden madam vice president mr imhof americans and the world when day comes we ask ourselves where can we find light in this never-ending shade the loss we carry a sea we must wade we've braved the belly of the beast we've learned that quiet isn't always peace in the norms and notions of what just is isn't always just this and yet the dawn is hours before we knew it somehow we do it somehow we've weathered and witnessed a nation that isn't broken but simply unfinished we the successors of a country and the time where a skinny black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president only to find herself reciting for one and yes we are far from polished far from pristine but that doesn't mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect we are striving to forge our union with purpose to compose a country committed to all cultures colors characters and conditions of man and so we lift our gazes not to what stands between us but what stands before us we close the divide because we know to put our future first we must first put our differences aside we lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another we seek harm to none and harmony for all let the globe if nothing else say this is true that even as we grieved we grew that even as we hurt we hoped that even as we tired we tried that will forever be tied together victorious not because we will never again know defeat but because we will never again sow division scripture tells us to envision that everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree and no one shall make them afraid if we're to live up to our own time then victory won't lie in the blade but in all the bridges we've made that is the promise to glade the hill we climb if only we dare it's because being american is more than a pride we inherit it's the past we step into and how we repair it we've seen a forest that would shatter our nation rather than share it would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy and this effort very nearly succeeded but while democracy can be periodically delayed it can never be permanently defeated in this truth in this faith we trust for while we have our eyes on the future history has its eyes on us this is the era of just redemption we feared it at its inception we did not feel prepared to be the heirs of such a terrifying hour but within it we found the power to author a new chapter to offer hope and laughter to ourselves so while once we asked how could we possibly prevail over catastrophe now we assert how could catastrophe possibly prevail over us we will not march back to what was but move to what shall be a country that is bruised but whole benevolent but bold fierce and free we will not be turned around or interrupted by intimidation because we know our inaction and inertia will be the inheritance of the next generation our blenders become their burdens but one thing is certain if we merge mercy with mites into mites with rights then love becomes our legacy and change our children's birthright so let us leave behind a country better than one we were left with every breath from my bronze pounded chest we will raise this wounded world into a wondrous one we will rise from the gold-limbed hills of the west we will rise from the wind swept northeast where our forefathers first realized revolution we will rise from the lake rim cities of the midwestern states we will rise from the sun baked south we will rebuild reconcile and recover and every known nook of our nation and every corner called our country our people diverse and beautiful will emerge battered and beautiful when day comes we step out of the shade a flame and unafraid the new dawn blooms as we free it for there was always light if only were brave enough to see it if only we're brave enough to be it thank you amanda gorman now for our benediction i'm pleased to introduce reverend dr sylvester beeman the pastor of the bethel african methodist episcopal church in wilmington delaware a friend of president biden for 30 years as a nation and people of faith gathered in this historical moment let us unite in prayer god we gather under the beauty of your holiness and the holiness of your beauty we seek your face your smile your warm embrace we petition you once more in this celebration we pray for divine favor upon our president joseph r biden and our first lady dr jill biden and their family we further asked that you would extend the same favor upon our vice president kamla d harris and our

the wounded and bind their wounds we will seek healing for those who are sick and diseased we will mourn our dead we will befriend the lonely the least and the left out we will share our abundance with those who are hungry we will do justly to the oppressed acknowledge sin and seek forgiveness thus grasping reconciliation in discovering our humanity we will seek the good in and for all our neighbors we will love the unlovable remove the stigma of the so-called untouchables we will care for our most vulnerable our children the elderly emotionally challenged and the poor we will seek rehabilitation beyond correction we'll extend opportunity to those locked out of opportunity we will make friends of our enemies we will make friends of our enemies people your people shall no longer raise up weapons against one another we will rather use our resources for the national good and become a beacon of life and good will to the world and neither shall we learn hatred anymore we'll lie down in peace and not make our neighbors afraid in you oh god we discover our humanity in our humanity we discover our commonness beyond the difference of color creed origin political party ideology geography and personal preferences will become greater stewards of your environment preserving the land reaping from it a sustainable harvest and securing its wonder and miracle-giving power for generations to come this is our benediction that from these hallowed grounds slaves labor to build this shrine and citadel to liberty and democracy let us all acknowledge from the indigenous native american to those who recently received their citizenship from the african-american to those whose four parents came from europe and every corner of the globe from the wealthy to those struggling to make it from every human being regardless of their choices that this is our country as such teachers oh god as such teach us oh god to live in it love in it be healed in it and reconcile to one another in it lest we miss kingdom's goal to your glory majesty dominion and power forever hallelujah glory hallelujah in the strong name of our collective faith amen please remain standing as the

I'M OUT OF IT. EAT, A BRINGER INTERNATI EAT, A BRINGER INTERNATI [Music] what's up guys I'm PHP here you know there used to be entire YouTube channels dedicated big ones to just reviewing cases you know laptop cases I phone cases I never really got super into that because I was like you know how interesting could a case really be I'm not a big case guy but this is got to be the most interesting case we've seen in a long time this is the new Apple magic keyboard case for the new iPad pro 300 bucks for the small one and 350 bucks for this bigger one and there was a lot of hype for this case right it was announced alongside this new iPad which was barely actually different from the previous iPad pro but along with the new mouse and cursor support on the iPad it Reese toked this whole fire of can the iPad pro be a full time computer so I've been using this new iPad and this magic case as my primary computer for the past couple days and all weekend and the conclusion I've gotten to is this is the best version of the iPad as a computer for sure but I would still rather have a laptop let me explain so for your money this is actually a pretty substantial like nice case there's a lot going on here it's a top part full of magnets that locks on the iPad and does not let go like it's a strong magnet pattern matching up to the iPad then there's a hinge which is like this long metal tube through the middle with a USB type-c pass-through port on the side for charging then a base which is the silicon rubberized material we've seen in Apple cases before with a full-size backlit keyboard and trackpad and it's a lot of material it's a bit thicker and heavier also than you might be imagining you ready for this iPad pro weighs this big one 640 grams and then without the iPad the case by itself weighs another 702 grams so it weighs more than the iPad so combined they are thicker and heavier than a MacBook Air and so while it's not nearly as elegant to open and close like a laptop would be the one thing you can say about this case is it is well built to get this in place basically you open this up and quickly you find that the hinge has this locking point where it gets to the locking point and it snaps into place and that's nice and on the top part continues opening like a hinge so you've opened it like this you take the ipad you lock it with the magnets into the top half everything lights up the pins are all connected and now it's floating above the keyboard as advertised now we've already seen iPad cases with keyboards before there's plenty people already using them but there's a couple things that make this one so impressive number one is that hinge it's pretty stiff like a laptop and it is limited in how far back it goes but actually find it goes just far back enough for any of my normal use it just kind of pops off the back and hovers the iPad there then the keyboard is really nice I think it's the nicest part it's scissor switches so it has a nice travel and it actually feels clicky like the new MacBook Air and 16 inch MacBook Pros keys and since the board is stiff and well built there's actually no flex at all unlike some laptops and then it's backlit which no doubt sucks a little bit of extra power from the iPads battery but I like the back light it's a nice touch it fades on and off and just generally yeah it's it's the best keyboard I've ever seen in an iPad case that's fax and then of course there's the trackpad too it's not the biggest trackpad in the world like you might find on a full-size laptop but it is nice and it definitely completes the laptop computer feel with the new iOS cursor and it clicks it really physically clicks so everywhere from corner to corner which is nice so now you have the iPad hovering above the keyboard here with just enough room to type and not really ever touch the iPad usually for me that's good and so now it feels like a computer the USB type C charging pass-through is at the bottom like where a normal computer port would be and I seem to be getting almost a hundred percent efficiency through those pins which definitely impressed me so it's like a real 13 inch laptop ish computer with a hundred twenty Hertz screen and iPad OS and all of its quartz so let me tell you there are still a lot of quirks to this the your main computer first of all weight management is something we often think about with these iPad cases in a laptop you open this by the hinge and all the weight all the guts in the computer are at the bottom and the top is just a light weight screen so opening and closing it pretty elegant not a whole lot of problems there but with the iPad in this case or any case like this the iPad is the computer and so most of that weight is up top and so it can feel a little bit top-heavy this is part of why they made this case so heavy is to try to combat this a little bit to try to make it feel a little bit less top-heavy but still it's not perfect this whole thing here it's still a pible in some positions that's a new word right laughable most of the classic laptop positions are still fine I know some people were wondering about this it's better than you might expect but from experience it's still not as flexible as a truly bottom weighted laptop where the hinge is just moving the screen weight and then if you get down to the keyboard great keyboard like I said physically speaking but there's no escape key so if I want to exit a full screen video or use anything you typically escape you have to touch the screen and you've probably noticed by now there's no function buttons at all on this keyboard meaning there's no brightness volume or even keyboard backlight brightness shortcuts here for all that you got to touch the screen in fact just to change the keyboard brightness you have to go into the Settings app into general into keyboard settings and then into keyboard hardware settings and then that's where you can manually turn up or down the keyboard backlight brightness luckily auto brightness is typically still pretty good it's using the iPads sensors by the way so that's hopefully not something you have to do very often but still you get the point here and then also I on a Mac I'm a I'm a command Q person as a lot of Mac people are whenever I want to quit an app command Q to close it it doesn't quite work the same way here if you're in an app and you hit command Q nothing happens you have to touch the screen or command H to go home but if you actually do want to close an app in your multitasking without touching the screen shout out to Peter McKinnon actually for teaching me this you go to the command tab menu and then find the app you to close in there and then command queue to close that and then you know like normal with an iPad there's a bunch of gestures from the trackpad and keyboard shortcuts to learn in fact if you hold down command at any point in anything it'll show you a list of all the keyboard shortcuts available to you at that time in that app so that's a pretty cool pro tip but that represents a little bit of a learning curve if you've come from something else with a keyboard so at the end of the day let me let me wrap it all up with this my MacBook Air spec is twelve hundred bucks this iPad pro the 13-inch the same size screen is a thousand bucks plus the $350 case that makes it 1350 now if I could only have one if I could only have a laptop with no iPad or this iPad keyboard case which is a bit more expensive but no laptop I really want to say I would rather have this I'd rather have like the ability to pop off and have an iPad at any time and then when I want to type I got the keyboard and I can go back and forth and it's much more fun it's a hundred twenty Hertz it's got way more apps there's cameras if I need them this is just more fun but I still need that laptop sometimes and for me that's especially when multitasking like if I'm writing the review on the keyboard and I have Spotify playing in the background and I just want to skip to the next song there's no button for it I have to go over into Spotify and then swipe and then come like have you ever tried to be on a zoom call and take notes at the same time in an iPad good luck it's not it doesn't work but all that being said in iPad land there are two types of people in this world those who get a case or a folio or a keyboard for their iPad and they keep it in it all the time they never take it out that's just the way the iPad is now or those who get a keyboard or case and pop it out and use it mostly like an iPad all the time and then sometimes they need to type so they'll pop it in here type away it becomes a typing machine then when they're done pop it back out use it as an iPad again for that second type of person this set up this accessory is the best possible version of the iPad this is a go this is awesome go for it spring the 300 bucks but for me I'm not getting rid of my laptop that's been it thanks

the last day at Dub Dub. Check it out. ♪ So many colors! Bye-bye! ♪ hi last year I did a video on Apple's beef with Qualcomm and vice versa you could find that here it's recommended viewing that'll make what I talked about here much simpler to digest and I also included all the sources down below long story short Apple is somewhat fed up at the fact that they have to pay Qualcomm the licensing fees that they do for using intellectual property that belongs to Qualcomm and their devices many companies have been trying to get around this for years Qualcomm are no angels I'm sure they've done many things that are underhanded and slimy and what we would expect of multi billion-dollar corporations that every now and then are gonna slip up and do something a little greedy or a little stupid but the thing that's funny here are the reasons that Apple says what they're doing is wrong one of the ways that Qualcomm x' patents and licensing agreements would work is they would base it on the price of the phone the idea is rather than charge a flat rate whether you're producing a fifty dollar blue phone or a one thousand dollar iPhone 10 we're gonna charge you a percentage of the price of the phone so that if you're making a cheap phone you can still use our patents and our chipsets in our products or if you're using an expensive phone you could still use our our stuff and that makes sense but the issue is once you start pushing the pushing the limit to the you know past 600 to 800 to 900 to a thousand and Apple is one of those first few large mainstream companies that released a mainstream popular product like the iPhone 10 that retails for $1,000 you can see why this would start to become a serious point of contention with them so they decided all right we're gonna go with another manufacturer and when they decide to go with another manufacturer Qualcomm got angry and said you still have to pay us Apple decided no these licensing fees are not fair we're not going to pay you and what I found particularly interesting with this case what I thought was interesting was where they say this phone is an iPhone 7 with 128 gigabytes of memory this one is 256 gigabytes of memory and it sells for more how is it fair for Qualcomm to charge as much as five dollars more for the same technology just because it's going into that expensive phone the same way I may wonder how is it fair that you not include an SD card slot in the phone so that I can choose how much I want to spend for the extra storage rather than you the same way I may ask how is it fair for you to say that this operating system can only run on your device the same way that I may wonder how is it fair that I get a legal call from kilpatrick in Townsend when I intellectual property that you claim is yours to show somebody how to replace a fuse because the way I see it if you can use Qualcomm is intellectual property to design a phone that you're selling and making hundreds of billions of dollars off of then surely I can use your intellectual property to show somebody how to replace a fuse in your own product if you go by Apple's definition of fairness which is what I find strange here if you go by the argument that si will is making in the post that I'll link to below it really does open up a large can of worms when it comes to their own devices why why is it that I can't buy my own SSD why is it that I am paying more for the same thing when I could get the same thing or the same hardware from another manufacturer in 2016 over 25 years after the laptop has been invented you managed to create a laptop that screws up one of the most basic elements of it which is opening the screen so that the cable which is too short wind up detaching and then you won't have any screen you create a new cable for this device which can be objectively demonstrated by simply opening them and measuring them as many people have in the newer model yet then you instruct the people at your store who are trained by you to not tell the customer that this exists if they come in with this problem they are trained to say oh yeah there's there's no design defect that doesn't exist that's not a known problem and yet you want to speak of fairness you want to use fairness in intellectual property fairness and doing business as the means by which contract law should be negotiated oh oh that's how it is because it's it's not about the contract it's not what you signed it's about what you subjectively think is fair oh great great now I understand how I should do business with you now I get it because I think how about this since I bought about 100 or 200 LP 1:33 wq1 - tje V screens for the a 1502 retina from 2013 to 2014 that worked up until the moment that you decided with the new version of your operating system to disable so that brightness doesn't work on them for no good reason other than that it's not a screen that had your blessing since I wasted money on that I would be fair if I walked into an Apple store right now started unscrewing display assemblies off of every single one of those machines until I got an amount of display assemblies back that matched the number of screens that up there that I paid over 90 dollars a piece for that are now completely useless that's what I think would be fair but see that doesn't matter fairness doesn't matter because we live in a society of laws and rules and contracts which you want enforced when it benefits you not anybody else but when it doesn't benefit you okay hey yeah I know that's the law I know that's what's legal I know that's the contract that we signed and agreed to but no it's not fair well [ __ ] you and what it comes down to is this is the agreement that you signed you may not find it fair but the deal is the deal and I think in my opinion you're either going to be fair across the board or you're gonna be unfair across the board but own it if you're going to be the [ __ ] be the whole [ __ ] say yeah we're unfair but we expect that in return don't use the word fairness when virtually nothing you've done over the past several years has been fair I don't think it is fair that you've taken the port off of the motherboard that allows people to get their data if the board fails I don't think it's fair to solder on the SSD when it's clear that you don't have the solder on the SSD and you get the same thickness as with the a 1708 versus the a 1706 I don't think it's fair that you got rid of the Apple service diagnostic that used to be built into the machine and make it so that you have to be an apple service provider that logs in with that specific serial of that specific machine and runs the test when you're not allowed to do anything with it but fair is not the contract you signed a licensing agreement if you don't think it is fair then by all means again by if you're gonna run things by your rules run them by your rules and come up with your own modem ship like have fun is the way I see it but anyway I'm kind of rambling on here what I find interesting is that tomorrow tomorrow there are supposed to be some people defying the claiming that these patents are invalid so Apple is claiming some of their patents may have been developed by an employee that used to work at Apple and according to Qualcomm they claim that you know that person had nothing to do with the creation of this patent and apparently after talking to Qualcomm that witness has said that they do not want to testify then at the last minute that witness that was an employee for Apple said okay nevermind I will testify and I am genuinely curious to hear what they have to say tomorrow because this has been going back and forth for a really long time and it's been really sort of petty stuff like Apple says we want to discount in exchange we won't challenge your patents and they say ok and then Apple kind of you know wink-wink nudge-nudge is that Samsung and says hey you should check you should check this out or you should ask your regulators to look into this so that it's not Apple challenging their patents its Samsung I am excited to see what happens tomorrow and I really am curious to see how this moves forward is Apple still going to have to pay Qualcomm tax even if they are using Intel chips is it gonna be found that these patents are invalid is Qualcomm going to be able to block iPhones from being imported into these countries kind of curious how it's gonna turn out and I just can't help but laugh the company that's saying how dare you with our intellectual property seems to be totally fine using Qualcomm's intellectual property and paying them nothing for it I've said I pay Apple frisk ematic I've said that I pay six or twelve thousand dollar subscription a year or whatever the hell they want I pay I pay Apple a markup to buy is l9 two three nines I would pay four times the retail price on store dot Rossman group.com just to be able to buy that stuff from intersil directly can I know I'm willing to pay they're not they're not even willing to pay five percent and again you may say what why should we have to pay this much well you're using their patent and you decided to make the phone $400 more expensive and I'm sure that that extra 5% that they're giving to Qualcomm is teeny tiny bit of that extra $400 that they're charging for virtually the same phone as last year just again move it closer to your face so that's it for today and let me know what you think in the comment down below I'm going to include a bunch of links to the sources that I had read up on when I was reading up on this case I am really interested for your thoughts your comments your agreements your disagreements pointed pointing out you know anything that I may have gotten wrong so that's it for today and as always I hope you learned something apple's wwdc event is coming up in just a few days and there is a ton of speculation going on surrounding what apple is going to be announcing including both software and hardware so what i'm going to do in this video is go through some recently revealed leaks rumors and hints from apple themselves to figure out what we should realistically expect and what we shouldn't so let's get right into it first off dub dub dc has always been apple's software developer event where they always reveal the next versions of their software for each of their products so we're going to be seeing everything from ios 15 and ipad os 15 to watch os 8 and even mac os monterey which apparently might be the name of the next mac os update based on recent leaks and rumors so before i get into the very juicy details about the hardware we should be expecting i want to talk about some new software features first mainly for the iphone and the brand new m1 ipad pro apple has recently been releasing teasers of their wwdc event showcasing a bunch of memojis and other things as well so i wanted to kind of dig deep into what those could potentially be hinting at looking at this first image you can see a lot of emojis of people from different races and backgrounds excited about wwdc but you'll also see some of them reacting to messages that others have sent so they're kind of interacting with each other and since there are so many of them there have been rumors of this hinting at apple releasing their new privacy focused social media network to compete with facebook and this makes a lot of sense because apple has recently been battling facebook over privacy concerns and many people have been upset with facebook over those issues on top of that the new twitter hash flag for this year's event is basically a thumbs up emoji within an imessage so the new network would likely be based on that somehow or some way so if apple does end up making their own social media network i can say for sure that i'm switching over because i trust apple way more with my personal info then i trust facebook and i have a feeling that it's not only going to be available on apple devices but android as well just so there's not going to be any antitrust issues there now on top of that if apple is going all out on this privacy thing we might even see apple release their own privacy focused search engine which has been rumored for a long time now and i'm excited about it because i know nothing is going to be able to track me across the web and as far as other features we can expect connor jewish on twitter posted that we could be seeing everything from a new food tracking feature ui changes new notification settings and look on lock screen and dark mode and messages app tweaks now in terms of the new mac os dylan dkt on twitter believes that wwdc will bring better support for iphone and ipad apps on apple silicon max by allowing developers to more easily bring them to the mac without using catalyst and this makes total sense because the ios app experience hasn't been so great so far on the m1 max and now let's get into the start of the show and something that many of you have been wondering and asking about and that's ipad os 15. as we know the new m1 ipad pro is extremely powerful compared to the previous model and i would honestly say that it is overkill for most people because even the 2018 ipad pro can run basically every app on the app store without any issues at all but with the new m1 ipad pro one problem we noticed was that in real world video editing performance we didn't really see any improvement at all in fact it was slightly slower than the previous model and that's because the software just isn't utilizing the performance well enough and then a bit later we compared two m1 ipad pros one with eight gigs of ram and another with 16 and we found that there was literally no difference at all even when we tried to max out the ram and check up on which apps stayed open and shortly after that we found out why as of right now apps within ipad os can only use up to a maximum of around 5 gigs of ram that is literally a defined limit within the software and developers cannot make an app use more than around 5 gigs even if they tried so the main question is why in the world would apple allow people to spend so much more cash on a 16 gig ipad pro if you can't even take advantage of it well i fully believe that apple is planning to remove or at least raise that 5 gig ram limit for apps within ipad os 15. and on top of that i fully believe that apple is planning to release pro apps like final cut logic and xcode and here's why first off john prosser leaked this in a tweet last year saying that those apps are 100 coming to the ipad pro second the m1 chip in the ipad pro is identical to the one in the latest max so all of the required hardware is there third if apple doesn't release those pro apps there are going to be a ton of people who will be extremely upset with apple for basically gimping their expensive ipad pro and not allowing it to use the full extent of its performance which is very clearly overkill for all of the apps that we already have and fourth in the case of final cut pro it would make total sense to have it on the ipad pro especially since it recently got support for hdr video editing and the new 12.9 inch model has the new mini led display which is perfect for that and of course beyond that there's gonna be some other improvements as well like most likely having full external display support and probably some new augmented reality features or updates for the lidar scanner and with all of that software stuff out of the way let's get into what you guys are really here for the hardware starting with the redesigned macbook pros over a month ago i tweeted that i am officially claiming that apple's redesigned m1x macbook pros will be announced at wwdc and in my explanation video i showed how all of the leaks and rumors came together for me to make that announcement so let me give you guys my main four reasons for why i initially thought that it would happen first a lot of the rumors at the time were pointing to a release date in the second half of 2021 which begins in july second since apple revealed the new imac and ipad pro at their spring loaded event but only started shipping them an entire month later i figured that apple could do the same thing with the macbook pro reveal at wwdc and ship in july third it was reported that apple had already begun production of the m1x chip and based on the timeline of when apple began the production of the m1 chip last year and the time that it actually was revealed it made total sense for the m1x chip to be ready for shipment in july and fourth everyone agrees that apple absolutely must show off these new macbook pros at an event since they're getting fully redesigned so it wouldn't make sense for apple to wait until the next october or november event to reveal the new macbook pros if the chips are basically already ready to go for a july launch and ever since i made that video there have been more and more people believing that we're getting new macbook pros at wwdc including john prosser who confirms that a macbook pro is coming maguire wood who also says it's coming at wwdc luke miyani who says he is going to start in only fans if they don't come at wwc and even the very reliable leaker mark german who says that the redesigned macbook pros are expected to debut as soon as early this summer saying that both the 14 and 16 inch models will be launched at the same time and on top of all of that apple released some more teaser images of memojis in front of macbooks and if you zoom into the reflection in the glasses you'll see three code words for eat sleep macbook possibly hinting at a new macbook coming at wwdc so based on all of that information i still fully believe that the redesigned macbook pros are going to be revealed at wwdc and yes my goatee is still on the line in case we don't see them in just a few days and just in case you guys are wondering what features and specs i'm personally expecting for the 14 and 16 inch macbook pros here's a full screenshot with all the specs that i think are going to be coming and with that said i believe that there is a good chance that the m1x mac mini could also be coming alongside the macbook pros at wwc and here's why first off when apple revealed the m1 chip in november they gave it to both the macbooks and the mac mini at the same time so i can see them repeating that method with the new m1x chip as well second the m1x macbook pros will be directly replacing the high-end intel 13-inch macbook pro and the 16-inch macbook pro which are still currently up for sale on apple's website and if you didn't already know the intel based mac mini is still also up for sale for 10.99 so it would totally make sense for apple to do it all in one sweep instead of waiting longer for the mini and third john prosser was able to get his hands on some images or cad files of the redesigned m1x mac mini and so far it looks pretty believable and matches up to what anyone would expect for the redesign so if they were able to get their hands on the leaks this early it could mean that the new mini is ready to be revealed at wwdc so with all that said let's finish off with some things that you should not expect at this year's wdc you probably shouldn't expect the 30 inch m1x imac or the m2 macbook air you shouldn't expect the new air pods and you shouldn't expect any other ipads either just the new macbook pros and potentially the mac mini now if you totally disagree with my speculations in this video go ahead and comment your thoughts down below but if you enjoyed it click that circle above to subscribe for more videos like this one definitely check out one of those two right there thanks for watching and we'll see you in the next video hey guys this is mike the detroitborg with a new ipad pros for 2021 in both the 11 inch and 12.9 inch size now as always there are some key similarities between these devices but some important differences but the big news for 2021 is the m1 chip which is borrowed from the mac lineup that brings the ipad closer to the mac range than ever before but the other big news is the new display technology on the 12.9 inch which really sets it apart from the 11 inch and we'll take a look at that difference once again the ipad pro is available in silver or space gray so no vibrant colors like on the imac or the ipad air what is new is the optional two terabyte configurations for both the 11 inch and 12.9 inch but we also get 5g for the first time which adds another 200 above the wi-fi model so that's more expensive than the lte radios from the previous generation in terms of the included accessories they're identical on both of these ipads the only difference is if you get the 5g model they'll include a sim ejection tool with your paperwork but otherwise you get the same set of white apple stickers along with a quick start guide also included is the new upgraded 20 watt power adapter this is the same power adapter that launched at the end of last year and of course a usb type-c power cable now while the 11 inch base price still starts at 7.99 the base price of the 12.9 inch is 100 more expensive at 10.99 and that's thanks to the xdr display and for the first time apple is talking about ram on their ipads so they come standard with eight gigs of ram but you can get 16 gigs on the one terabyte or two terabyte version so that's a massive increase over the six gigabyte from the previous generation and it also sounds very similar to the mac lineup in terms of design not a huge departure from the previous generation the display is still pushed to the edges and rounded off at the corners which is the reason they call it a liquid retina display because it's smoothly rounded off at the corners in terms of the basic specs and dimensions these displays are carried over from the previous generation the only real difference here is the backlighting technology on the 12.9 inch but before we get to that let's talk about the basics so both of them have the same pixel density of 264 ppi they also have promotion technology which adaptively adjusts the refresh rate of the display up to 120 hertz so you get that extremely smooth refresh rate especially within the ui of the os we also have some of the basics like true tone technology which will automatically adapt the white balance of the display to the ambient lighting conditions of the room and we get 600 nits of max brightness we also have a very effective anti-reflective coating so even though these displays are glossy the anti-reflective coating makes it pretty easy to manage it so one of the big challenges of hdr on a conventional lcd screen like the one on the ipad 11 inch is that you need extremely bright highlights and deep contrast in order to pull off the effect properly but you can't do that with a conventional backlight because in order to get those highlights you have to bring up the brightness which washes out the black level that's where an xdr display comes in with a matrix of leds behind the entire lcd display which allows them to turn off individual zones to achieve true black levels that means you get an oled like contrast ratio of a million to one now we've seen this technology before on tvs but with a device this small you need a lot more leds for it to be effective in the case of this ipad pro there's 10 000 mini leds across this entire panel and they're grouped together in local dimming zones specifically 2596. so this allows the ipad to focus light into only the areas of the screen that needs to be lit but the most important aspect of this display technology is that it's extremely bright where it needs to be without washing out the entire screen in fact this display can push out up to 1600 nits of maximum brightness in hdr so that's useful for highlights or specular highlights things that need to be bright on the display while everything else needs to be dark or black to achieve that extreme contrast that's when things really pop in hdr but of course there are some drawbacks because there's far fewer leds than there are pixels so that means you're going to still see some haloing around the areas you're lighting especially when the background is supposed to be black now this is something you really only notice in certain scenarios and it's much less obvious when you're looking at the ipad head-on especially in a semi-lit room but otherwise this display is much more immersive and vibrant than any other ipad screen i've used now there are some design differences between the wi-fi and 5g model to point out so for example there's an extra antenna strip on the 5g model at the bottom edge and if you look at the antenna stripe at the top edge of the 5g model you'll see that it wraps around the corner and there's some additional antenna stripes at the top edge but more importantly with this generation are the millimeter wave antennas which you'll find position at the top edge and bottom edge this is the same antenna design that's also on the iphone 12. apple actually had to redesign the entire chassis of the ipad pro in order to accommodate the optional 5g radios so even if you have a wi-fi model you can see the effects of the 5g design so if you compare this to the previous generation you can see that the speaker grills have been moved toward the center and they've reduced the overall width and increase the overall size of the perforations so that's one way to identify if you have a 2021 ipad just count the number of speaker holes you have the 5g ipad also has a nano sim tray along the bottom right edge although you don't need to use this because there's also an electronic embedded sim inside the ipad although the dimensions of the 11 inch haven't changed the 12.9 inch pro has gotten slightly thicker in order to accommodate the xdr display but it's only half a millimeter thicker and it's imperceptible you really have to zoom in closely like i'm doing here to illustrate the difference in fact accessories that worked for the previous ipad pro like the magic keyboard will still fit on this one now those millimeter wave patches at the top and bottom is not to be confused with the magnetic charging dock for the apple pencil along the side again which is also color coordinated with the ipad you bought speaking of accessories we still have that three pin power connector along the back of the ipads which connect with accessories like the apple magic keyboard or fuller keyboard or other third-party accessories and that works with all the magnets integrated into the design of this chassis which keep all the accessories nice and secure another feature that's exclusive to the ipad pro which really makes a difference is the quad speaker design which automatically re-orientate the sound depending on how you're holding the ipad so these quad speakers have been tweaked for the new chassis design but they still sound very similar to the previous generation which are really impressive the sound is very immersive and powerful for such a small device and you get support for things like dolby atmos and spatial audio both ipad pros also have five microphones which apple calls studio grade so we find one along the side two along the top edge near the truedepth camera another microphone right next to the truedepth camera which faces the user and another microphone built into the camera module on the back so we have all of these microphones for stereo audio pickup along with noise cancellation also upgraded is the truedepth camera which gets a new 12 megapixel sensor with an ultra wide 120 degree view this enables a really neat new feature called center stage which is able to crop in to focus on the subject as they move around the room it's a really natural result so it's able to correct for distortion especially barrel distortion because of this wide-angle lens as well as correcting for exposure as the subject moves farther away so here we are testing out the front-facing camera and the microphone array of the 12.9 inch from last year versus the m1 12.9 inch from this year which definitely has some benefits with that ultra wide angle and you can crop it in if you prefer but definitely a nice feature to have and the microphones are similar in terms of overall performance the camera hardware is largely carried over from the previous generation so we get two cameras and a lidar scanner for depth mapping so the main camera is 12 megapixels with an f 1.8 aperture without optical image stabilization we also get an ultra wide 10 megapixels with an f 2.4 aperture and both of these cameras are good for 4k up to 60 frames per second although the camera hardware is the same what's new is the m1 chip which brings with it a much more powerful isp or image signal processor so one of the new features it brings is smart hdr3 which is the same technology used on the iphone 12s so we get very similar hdr performance to those phones although i'm not a huge fan of smart hdr3 i think it tends to be a little more aggressive than i think it should be but of course a lot of people prefer something that really pops right out of the camera the lidar scanner is something we've seen on the iphone 12 pro and the previous ipad pro and this time it's combined with the m1 processor for even more impressive ar results so under the cool new demos is within the apple clips app which allows you to experiment with this feature so the lidar scanner can map every surface in the room and then apply effects to those surfaces and that's pretty fun to play with so it knows what's the table top versus what's the floor ceiling walls and objects within that area one of the other benefits of the m1 chip is that it brings usb 4 and thunderbolt to the ipad for the first time that means this port can support up to 40 gigs per second that's enough to drive a 6k xdr display at full resolution and if you're a video editor that makes it a lot easier and a lot quicker to transfer large 4k files from an sd card or an external ssd over the usb connector although we have support for an external display most apps are not optimized for it so we still have some way to go in terms of software before this becomes a really useful feature otherwise it's mostly mirroring or full screen video or photographs so we're pretty familiar with the m1 chip that's in this ipad pro because it's in the imac the macbook air the macbook pro and the mac mini and we get the full 8 core cpu and 8 core gpu model which is kind of interesting when you consider that a lower end version of this chip has a 7 core gpu which is offered on the macbook air and the imac either way this is a substantial improvement over the a12z it replaces we're up 50 on the cpu and 40 on the gpu in terms of what this means to the ipad pro it doesn't mean the whole lot right now because it really depends on the software to drive that hardware and right now ipad os and the apps aren't really optimized for this architecture just yet so hopefully we're going to see improvements pretty soon let's take a quick look at ipad os on the new ipad so you can see i'm kind of blocking the camera right there so once i move my hand it scans my face really quickly and i can swipe to get into my home screen so on the home screen i have this widget panel which i can swipe in and out of or scroll through and i can also edit as well so this will take me to my editor and i can customize the widgets that are in that panel this is always very useful to have all right in terms of the main home screen layout we of course we have our dock down below which you can customize just tap and hold until you get to the wiggle and then you can move the apps out of there you can see in the dock we have our recent apps on the right so these are our three most recently accessed apps swipe down from the upper right corner to get to your control center which you can also customize but here we have our controls for our display such as our dark mode which we can turn on and off night shift and true tone of course we get to our notifications by swiping down below and you can also swipe from that screen to get to those widgets as well in terms of multitasking there's a few ways you can do this you can use a four finger gesture on the screen to quickly swipe between your apps like so you can also swipe up to see the overview of all of your apps but you can also open up apps side by side so for example if i open up the apple tv app i can swipe up to get to the dock to dock another app on the side so let's go ahead and try the home app here so all i have to do is drag it to the side let it dock and now i have a split screen view between these two apps so i can interact with my smart home on the right side while navigating through my media on the left i can also undock this app and tuck it to the side like so and swipe it back in when i need it and i can continue using both apps side by side but the apps do need to support this split screen view and this arrangement is safe so if you go back to the app you can swipe in again to get back to your pair for the most part the software experience on both of these ipads is identical but there's a slight difference here in terms of the keyboard so because we have more room on the 12.9 inch you get a number row at the top which is not here on the 11 inch but a good tip to know about using this on-screen keyboard is that you can resize it so it's a little more manageable so i have to do is tap and hold this keyboard icon select floating and then you get the floating keyboard which you can reposition on the screen like so you can even toss it around like that now to re-dock it just swipe down and let it dock at the bottom and it expands back out so when it comes to choosing between these two sizes i think the 11 inch is ideal if you primarily intend to use this for media consumption or for traveling or just using it like a regular ipad but the 12.9 inch is pretty large and kind of cumbersome to use as a tablet so i think this is the best tablet to use as a laptop replacement the screen is certainly bigger than most laptops and i think it's the best size for an attached keyboard and the other thing is that it gives you the best display on any apple device you can buy today but as always the ipad pro seems to be overpowered for what it can do today but that isn't necessarily a bad thing because it gives you plenty of headroom for software updates in the future and for apps that can really take advantage of the hardware so just to recap the laundry list of features on this ipad from the integrated apple pencil charger to the usb4 port the ultra wide truedepth camera with face id still the only ipad that has it the quad speaker design which makes this the best sounding ipad by far the studio grade 5 microphone array and the lidar scanner for augmented reality not to mention 5g wi-fi 6 and up to 2 terabytes of storage with up to 16 gigs of ram so this is one of apple's most capable and feature packed devices but the software story could use some improvement alright guys hope you enjoyed this look at the ipad pro if you did please give it a thumbs up to let me know and i'll see you again in my next video [Music] this place is cool thank you so much i am at some point i'm gonna this wall is gonna go away and i'm gonna make a big like songwriting deck out there because i'd like to go outside we have a little mini spot out there but my mom came in here and spruced the place up and she's obsessed with putting like photos of me with all these people everywhere so this is like a mother's doing i love how you came straight in and you like and you zeroed in on the thing that i would have gone to and you've justified it without me even raising it it's my [ __ ] mother came here today i'm like yo why because my mom she just is like you know she wants me to be proud of my moments but it's just very like it's cute in her house but in my house i feel like it's kind of like a like a whole dentist you know when you go and you're like i don't really care whose teeth you clean like you go to that dentist as well yeah can you clean teeth or not i don't care about the pictures on the wall it's so lay how you doing i'm doing really good i'm happy to be talking to you you too i was thinking it's nice actually out of all the times you know covid has just been just so hard on everybody whether it's actually physically getting the illness or just mentally and spiritually or you know so many people are just experiencing anxiety and fear but the one great thing is you know to bring you to my studio bring you to my home yeah we've never been able to sit where i was thrilled the music really gets i mean when it came into my diary and it's i was like where are we doing it and they're like well it's it's at miley's place i was thrilled because you're right it started out in our place and then it was covert orientated tech talk yeah i don't like that especially with you and me you know you want to have a real conversation and i think with that i think timing is everything you know i learned that whether that was in love or relationships or just comedy i mean just even to to make people laugh to make people cry there's a timing to all of it and when you lose that timing and that connection and that awareness of okay i'm sensing what you're feeling you're sensing what i'm feeling when you lose that i think that's what's kind of been causing some of this anxiety and fear because there's an unknowingness of the response you lose that when you're talking through a screen well the core of anxiety and fears is a desire for control and we put that in the same conversation as time yeah and that's why when things happen to you it's like oh i have the worst timing yeah i can't believe this time that happened yeah and it's interesting that you would look at it from a different perspective of like actually i lean into the concept of time even if at the time it felt like a bad time also i think there's something about you kind of fall into the right timing and i think there's been times where i've wanted to rush in times where i wanted to wait and there's just seasons and that's been this record for me because this record i really was patient with and patience you could probably get a lot of adjectives of the things that i am but patient i don't think if you ask anyone around me would necessarily be you were sort of pushed in that direction right because it's so funny i was thinking back to the last time we really spoke well around the last album which was younger now album album and it's funny that title you know because i think about like you were really you were on a mission to mature and to build a life for yourself to stabilize yourself and you called that album younger now and it all just felt very at odds and then 2018 the whole thing just tips upside down as you wrote so poignantly in your note and i think about that that's a push toward patience because that's about losing control you can't control that that must have been the problem with looking back on it now the most significant one of the most significant events of your life that fire i write down everything like i my dad always says you know when you write it down when you say it out loud you give it power you begin to create it the minute that you write it down so i write everything down you know i did write about i guess it was a push into patience but it's now a part of my character and it's something that i really am proud of and it i feel it was earned um to be patient and as much as there's things that i'll miss it really what i gained which patients being one of them was worth it in a sense finding a balance of feeling detached but still being able to connect yeah you know yeah i would never want someone to say you know she just wasn't there with me she just you know i i do have a problem with people that that think being protected or guarding yourself in some way is detachment is attachment because if you don't protect yourself then like take all the locks off your house leave the keys in the car sure don't wear shoes on your feet well also you have a right to keep something to yourself i mean you or yourself before anybody came into your life ultimately outside you know the family that you have and even then the minute you're born it's your journey mm-hmm and i wonder i've always wanted to ask you this as you now get to a higher state of self-awareness through your music through your life through learning through relationships through all of it through maturity right it's called maturity do you look back now on what you were told by your parents what you how you acted as a kid the kind of kid you were from that you know they all just had the earliest memories have you always been this no i mean i am not the person i was yesterday you know last night sitting behind you cutting with stevie nicks on the phone that changed me forever you know everything changes me forever and i'll never be who i was yesterday in a way every night before i go to sleep i say goodbye to myself in a way because it's like that person's done and there's like a sadness to it sometimes because i do evolve really quickly because i'm very absorbent like i just take everything in yeah and recently i've had to do inventory of what i've owned as mine that isn't mine because i think like you're saying your parents so whether it's generational or the way that you're raised or you know you you really do get passed through dna yeah personality and character even fear yeah nature versus nurture for sure you know exactly nature versus nurture and we're all just an equation of all those things adding up you know the last three years i called it the the cocktail of chaos because it just felt like the worst bartender ever which was like as the universe yeah sometimes just kept pouring the [ __ ] and you're like oh my god like can't drink any more of this [ __ ] yeah and you're just like you know you're dizzy often that's what i mean like when we spoke in 2017 and the album was coming out and you were just like i got this like i got the relationship i got the album i got that life i'm good yeah and then and life just laughs it's like you're not done yet you know i i kind of hate the saying but also love it that when you make the plan that life you know laughs at you because i do think there's something to having an idea of what you want and like setting a goal and seeing it you know i daydream a lot daydreaming and like seeing it all happen but not letting it completely consume you to the point where there's no other opportunities you exactly and become i never let an idea or a schedule determine my creative choices so listen like i made a record you and i had talked during younger now and then i was going and making a set of three eps which were amazing i was in love with the songs you know but those two eps weren't relevant anymore and even though i loved the songs for what they were they lost their relevance so to me i can't ever release that is the only thing that you did in that equation that that doesn't play to how you would do that now is you announced it yeah when you announce it you get power that's the plan yeah exactly and then it goes upside down i didn't realize you lost stuff though oh yeah so every computer every journal every song i've ever written you know and i write a lot of songs that no one ever hears they're just for me actually yesterday i was going through i have a joan jett book and i was looking at some pictures of her getting inspired and i was like we had the exact same handwriting and i realized it was my handwriting i had used her book as my songwriting journal so if you know if i don't have anything you just pick up a record and just right i was right on it and so i was like man me and joan do have a lot in common i even have her handwriting and then i realized that's my handwriting yeah i do not remember her writing about like you know floating through space with an astronaut so that was like in my dead pet studio i had had a book sitting here on this console this console survived the fire this is from my studio in malibu and um yeah my dad actually was like can i have that i'm like dude this is what i the one thing that we really had left was my freaking console it's mine he's like i know but i just got the perfect compressor i need a place to put it like you have to get your own damn console this is like because my studio was the only thing that was left so this kind of from here and those signs those were that's a sign that's the only thing i had left was my studio that's all that was left was my music wow oddly you know i didn't have a lot of my songwriting journals in my studio because that's never i mean for me that's never where i write a song i never write a song in the studio can i ask you a really weird question i've never asked anyone because it was such a such a unique experience that you go through something as kind of traumatic and life shaking as that what is it like when you walk through what used to be a home dude i mean part of you wants to just start digging through ashes and find whatever is left you know so part of me wants to do that and part of you creates the the walls and the what was there and you can almost see pictures i mean part of you you're i guess it's somewhat of muscle memory of some kind you know it starts putting it all back together again and then a part of you is very peaceful i also am very fortunate because i knew that i would have some place to go that i would not be displaced yeah and now so your security's checked my security is fine and i know that about my life i never stop being grateful for that my life is extremely unique and i'm sometimes feel overly fortunate and i had my own guilt with that you know so being there there was a sense of peace knowing that there was nothing i could do about it because there's times where me wanting to control has been able for me to create this authentic brand i never do anything that i don't want to do my music is exactly what i want it to be being in control a lot of the time works in my favor but being obsessed with control can also be really damaging to just being in what the plan that the above has for you so i battled with that but i more so i really felt at peace knowing that there's nothing i can do about it and i've taken that piece and i try to find that space because there's a billion other times in your life that there's gonna be nothing that you can do about it having that that freedom now of not being just so in love with control has been really good for me yeah it's funny you talk about that because if i go through and i read it from an altitude and i said cherry pick the events that we've all seen and heard that's the trade of being a performer i suppose is that stuff gets put out here it does feel like the moments when things have taken you in a vastly different direction to be the moments when you've on the outside have being in complete control uh-huh yeah well i i thrive in in chaos a little bit and i also i don't like making decisions this is one thing that i don't like i do not like someone asked me to go to dinner you choose like i do not like me oh that's annoying i don't like making decisions that's because i really am kind of happy anywhere right i just am and until you're not until until i'm like this place sucks but i'm like so obviously really i really like people kind of i mean when it comes to my music into my craft i really really like making my own choices and making my own art but those aren't really decisions you know those aren't to me those aren't decisions they're probably very big decisions if you're not used to making them all the time but like putting out music to me isn't a big decision it's like it just is like it's just flowing out constantly so i liked that i never had to make a choice about saying goodbye to that house it just said goodbye to me there was no choice in it and i really liked that about about the non-decision-making process so it's been a year i mean if this is still the case and no judgment but from what i can tell it's been a year since you chose sobriety right since you decided to clear your head yeah how did it feel when you started to wake up and realize that that was working well i like a lot of people you know being completely honest during the pandemic fell off and felt really a lot of you know and i would never sit here and go i've been [ __ ] sober and i didn't and i fell off and i realized that i now am back on sobriety two weeks sober and you know i feel like i really accepted that time and one of the things i've used is don't get furious get curious so don't be mad at yourself but ask yourself what happened isn't that a step towards moderation like i'm not trying to speak for anybody here because everyone has their own battles and some things affect people in far more volatile ways i'm from new zealand yeah moderation's kind of in our blood yeah right so you know from my perspective it's like if if you're curious why why do you need to make a statement either way i guess so i didn't choose to make a statement i think that somehow i remember it was like a couple months ago and i was doing an interview and the conversation just came up and i think i said it just like i'm talking to you and sometimes i forget because like i think it might have been with me it might have been like a real conversation like how i said right now listen i [ __ ] up like i wasn't sober like over the last couple months and to me it was a [ __ ] up because i'm not a moderation person right and i don't think that everyone has to be [ __ ] sober i think everyone has to do what is best for them i don't have a problem with drinking i have a problem with the decisions i make once i go past that level of you know even even into you know i i just been wanting to wake up 100 100 of the time yeah i get that and i get dialing you know the numbers and reaching out to people that i've detached from purposely but when we drink sometimes there's almost like no future whatever you want right now i become very impulsive yeah we're all going through the same thing we're all this kind of malleable experience you came out of this world at a young age where it was like you can't be malleable yeah i know exactly yeah it's a very obvious observation yeah apologies if it's just pure cliche do you make do you personally trace it back some of how you want to break free and just live in the moment it can trace that back to this idea of like you got to button up here you got to do things the way they're done in a way i feel really grateful that i had all that like training and experience and how so because i would think of myself as a um i'm very diligent and if i want something i usually can get it and that taught me a lot about that like i'm very resilient you know i like a lot of the qualities that became embedded in me by my upbringing which my upbringing was not normal discipline i'm very disciplined yeah very disciplined that's why it's never easy but it's pretty easy for me to be sober or in and out of sobriety because like the day i don't want to [ __ ] do anymore i don't the day that i do i do you know and but when i don't want to it's really it just is i'm just very disciplined and so there's something about that that i really like and i would say that there's a level of professionalism that i would bring to any craft even if that was working at a restaurant i would be just totally obsessive about being the best one you know and so there's something about that that i really like that's a button you switch though i've seen you turn it on where it's just like i'll slay this room uh-huh right but then i've also seen you seemingly walk into a room very safe in the knowledge that you can do that disciplined thing well that's confidence and then go i'm gonna do the opposite yeah i'm gonna like set fire to it yeah well that's having like a security that i've i used to be able to call on it and find it and i guess now still you know i have moments of of my weakness and like the humanity takes over sometimes but most of the time there's like a a level of security now and i see it every time i'm scared i just picture glastonbury it makes you want to crawl into a hole where no one can find you and i did not want to go on that stage i was so terrified it's scary i had never been more terrified in my life i prayed i got on hands and knees and prayed like please like i was thinking i'm actually gonna have a heart attack like i was like oh i'm actually just gonna fall to the floor and faint like i because most of the time i envision and see myself doing it like thoroughly already like i i see everything that as if it's already been done yeah i couldn't see it and that's all i kept saying was like i don't have any premonition about this like i cannot see it that's for you i was so terrified and when i thought about it i just saw like dark like i couldn't see it and i was so terrified and you know luckily it made sense that my dad come because he did old town road but really i just wanted my [ __ ] dad i was scared and you know i haven't called on daddy because i'm scared of something in freaking 15 years and i was like yeah i i'm scared when i'm terrified and i feel the lump in my throat and i can tell my you know that lump in your throat's my heart coming up here my stomach is down here i just really picture glass and berry and i encourage everyone have that to name their glass and berry yeah what's the scariest thing you've ever done and got through yeah and that can even be a loss you know i guess probably one of my bigger fears was losing my grandmother who's tattooed on my arm she was all she ran my fan club for 10 years my grandma took me to do everything she literally opened every letter from a fan for 10 years every single one and wrote back like love miley's miami every time and losing her and so that can be your glastonbury you know it doesn't have to be that it could be anything what was the thing that you were the most afraid of and you conquered it and then find that you know so it's like finding the peace and the fire when you're standing on top of the ashes of your home and i found peace you can train your brain to find that again you know in that feeling and so i just encourage you to put a pin in moments where you feel like you conquered something and then just try to bring yourself into that place again it's so nice being in this home because it really feels like you just even just walking around these areas by the studio and looking around and ignoring the really sweet poignant photos your mama's stacked up like i know like the dentist's office they're perfectly stacked yeah it's like there's some marmity totally but it it just feels very much like you live here and i don't always get that feeling not to put anyone blast but sometimes i'm like oh no you tour yeah this doesn't feel like you're home yeah this has got you written all over it has the idea of home change to you after you lost that home and then you went through so much significant personal change like what is home now what is a home a home to me is and it can be any space any size that when someone else enters that space they know it's yours and i don't think you would think anyone but me would probably live here the reason that there's like the big screen behind us i'd like to create animation you know so i can animate in here i can do my music video editing in here and it's really just i think something about staying where the song is made because like it kind of lives in here forever you know when you walk through a historic home or like a landmark you can like feel its history i feel the same way about my studios and my spaces but then again keeping that slight protection and slight detachment to knowing it can all go away and it's all the stuff and when i'm gone it'll be someone else's guitar the acoustic guitar doesn't feel like that's my new that acoustic guitar yeah that's a 1957 martin yeah that's serious yeah that's serious and then i just got a yeah yeah she's from 1969 and i like that it was she's a blondie so i like that she was blonde it's the only color for offender 69 it's my favorite color blonde do you play them yeah i play them there's so many interesting musical references on this album are plastic cards i'm so thrilled as a fan that you pivoted away and and worked on a body of work i thought the shia's trilogy was going to be interesting but when i knew that you were making an album i was like all right now i get to hear what the complete body of thought yeah this the kind of she is era was i guess some sort of a representation of my uh i guess a little bit of a fear of commitment when it comes to having a actually what you said it's perfect when we're talking about the statement having a full body of work it's from radio here's who i am yeah and when you make a record especially the way that i used to actually make albums you have to turn that in half a year before anyone's going to hear it you're distant from it you're you're you know time heals all yeah the songs that are filled with pain or love or life or you're removed from it because your senses aren't really so attached to those memories anymore and so i always hated making physical records i'm so happy that we've moved into a new way of putting out music especially if you say goodbye to yourself every night and that's what i'm saying by the time look dude this is daily that i that i change you know and i actually really don't like when people you know say that it's being fickle or you don't get to just decide you know actually me and why we've gotten into argument about this before because i said you know if i say something five minutes ago that's what i said five minutes ago because i believed it and so i so he was like that is unfair that you live your life that way that's fine to be that way as an artist you know but as a person as a friend and you know i'm like no he's just trying to get his own way i know he's the master at that i'm taking notes but i've had that in a lot of you know friendships relationships collaborators because i evolved just really quickly and change really quickly and everything that happens changes my experience i'll be different tomorrow because of this because maybe i'll realize something or something that was in here that needed to kind of be released released does and now i don't feel that way towards it this is about the most in the moment i've heard someone describe themselves in a very long time you talk about release it comes at a you know you have to you have to just like waste the stuff and on this album on plastic i'm just going to go there man relationships get a tough time on this album yeah no doubt about it yeah like brutal yeah like there's lines on this record that are just like wow serious sense of self-awareness i will never be that person that you want me to be i will never be that faithful person you want me to be i want to be out of all the songs because never be me is a song that even mark kind of challenged when i first wrote it because mark had made this wrong for the record mark ronson had made the most beautiful arrangement it was something that was very simple you know he's not the guy it's totally different experience working with someone like watt or someone like you know mike will on bangers he does not have just like a beat library mark ronson it's you know it's an arrangement yeah yeah so he's not going through and flipping through beats and saying it's not pick one you know you're not going through the rack and trying stuff on and seeing what fits it's customized which i adore yeah and so it was something super simple and the words just literally started getting like pulled out of me and because you don't sit there and think those through no i actually had a really kind of uh intense conversation about that song the other day because men happen to notice that song on the record a lot more than i mean women do because i thought it was kind of like my bonnie tyler moment you know that's what i was really writing and i thought women go yes that's totally me but actually men are always like are you really never able to be that person you know i'm a tripper but this is how i think of songs when i write a song like that i capture something that is in inside of me i kind of call it like you know temptation or a little part of evil or a little bad even though it's totally not evil to have that thought but it's something that doesn't have to be who i am but i get to capture it and honor a feeling that i have in a moment and i can capture it like a [ __ ] firefly and have it and admire it but it doesn't have to come with me and be a part of who i am anymore because i'm really proud of like my loyalty that i have towards those that i love or you know down to the animals i mean i just like when i love i am very loyal to people i mean you could tell this by any time you see me or any of my team or you know i'm a loyal person but there's times you know where it says you know is it wrong that in my mind i walk the line i lay with fire you know and i felt that way right then and i got to capture it and i didn't have to take it with me anymore so in a way you get to kind of honor it and know that it's a part of you but that it doesn't now have to be who you are anymore this is the trade if you don't get to express yourself through that thought and commit it to music to art to expression it sits with you it can fester yeah it can get really malignant yeah it can become a problem in your life yeah you release it keeps you balanced and guess what others hear it they don't feel quite so crazy right that's the trait you feel you feel less alone when you listen to songs like that and you say like okay this is human i'm human she's human i'm human it erases that divide between the artist and the audience i don't like that divide i want to be i am my audience you know and like i don't even really like the idea of an audience you know i guess it's like the listener or i don't even really like the word fans because in a way it's like to me i i this career has been so long from the age that i started you know who you are from the time where i was introduced to my audience at 12 to who i am now they really know me pretty well you know we've had a very intimate but you fought to pull that barrier down yeah i don't i don't like that barrier at all yeah but it's an incredibly transparent space for you to live in if you're going to be transparent and remove that gap between the stage and the crowd metaphorically speaking this time you have to show it all you can't just show the good well that's actually why i created a c stage on bangers and it was low it was a couple feet lower than the stage because i didn't want people looking up at me right that felt like some weird royalty or something i didn't want this you know i want like we're connected but this goes back to that thing i said before where you said you know i sometimes i feel guilty about the level of security and what i've been able to build for myself in relation to the people that are sharing this existence with yeah and you know writing a song like never be me it's a sacrifice too and it's a choice that i commit to because some of the songs i write i am not ignorant to the pain that they can cause to the subjects and a lot of the time have to choose again is it worth it for me to release this you know and i mean release it not to everyone else but to me to allow this thought or this feeling to come out and because it's giving it power like my dad says you write it down you speak it you give it power it's real now it's something more than the thoughts in your head now one thing that i've really been into lately is the the voices in your head i think there's kind of three of us in here i think there's there's that angel there's the devil there's the one that goes well this is what i really want yeah but if you do that then the repercussion and then there's the person sitting in the back that's actually just observing so so this is kind of the theory behind it is that if you're the listener if you're the one listening to the voices inside your head they aren't you because you're observing it and it's just like you're having the same thought as me right now because i'm telling you it so you're computing it but you're not me and so the two voices in your head are not you and the only thing that they do is create your perspective for you and kind of narrate your life and help you digest i guess everything that's happening it's almost like a computer you know but it's not they're not you and so the voices inside my head i guess they're kind of the ones that also write some of this music but it's not necessarily me who's observing does that make any sense did you read a book called untethered soul appears that's where the concept comes from that's what creates the self-obsessed borderline narcissism that people realize oh there's just a selfishness there or there's an inability to see beyond your own framework and it's really just because you're consumed by these voices but until you realize that until you read that book until you start to analyze and identify what your best pathway through that is most people tend to lean into destructive ways to quieten the voices yeah do you recognize that behavior is that part of why you found yourself in and out of trouble here and there and doing things like that because you're trying to cope for sure i mean i think especially just my experimentation we'll call it you know with with drugs and alcohol i mean i mean all that was just me you know sometimes i guess also wanting to excuse them and allow them to run wild like in a way getting messed up was a way of me allowing myself to do things that i never really would allow those voices to control exactly so i think now my life has been truly changed by the concept that i'm not the voice inside my head that i'm just observing because there's like a piece to it of knowing it's actually the way that it's explained in the book is you would never hang out if those were physical beings you would never hang out with the voices inside your head they never stop when you're watching a movie yeah it's like well did i turn off the stove did i whatever if your friend was in there like did you do this today did you put a gas in the car do you be like shut up like i'm just trying to watch a movie or i'm just trying to go outside and enjoy my garden or i'm just trying to take a drive with my mom the thing that really made me just commit to this theory and really try to balance myself in it is my mom losing her mom because you know one day i was driving in the car next to the beach with my mom and i was thinking about something totally else my i was not there i was i was there with her but i was not there i was thinking about the records did i turn in the mix do i actually like the way that hate me sounds i'm still kind of annoyed with something that i chose to do on the last course i hate me it still bothers me and so i'm sitting here like ah i really you know what i should have told lubell no i don't like that and so i'm sitting there thinking about it and i'm like yo do you know what my mom would give to be in the car driving next to the beach with her mom right now the fact that these two voices are trying to steal this moment from me stay personal i am not them so the presence is the one sitting and observing that's just at peace with where i am at that moment that takes discipline though and that's where i thrive so luckily it's been a quick adjustment for me once i take it and absorb it it's pretty easy for me to apply it isn't there a part of you as well though just based on what i've read and what i've mainly what i've heard through your music that as soon as you get disciplined in something you're like yeah destructive well it's when it no longer serves or no longer feels like it's a part of me anymore i mean that's a part of the constant shift of every second is i mean every second is changing me so much which is terrifying really for everyone that experiences me i'm my best friend but i don't know if i'd want to be my best friend if i wasn't in my own body i've had to learn that it's not selfishness because i used to feel guilty terrible shame i spill a lot of shame and i learned that guilt and shame are different changes your life guilt is healthy you know guilt is if i don't wear my mask i'm going to hurt someone right and so i need to wear this mask shane is a killer shame is never going to help you i hate shame so there is no shame in the fact that this is me this is i mean there's qualities if you're destructive and you're hurting other people you have to work on yourself it's constant effort but i want to be my best friend actually i'd be my best friend because my loyalty because when i shift like that i don't leave bodies behind i take everyone with me for the journey it's just like you gotta walk fast i've asked a few artists this question and the answer is universally the same you know um in in having to focus on expressing yourself through your craft and learn about yourself in the moment and then ultimately work that moment reach people and go out and people is what is the what is the greatest sacrifice and every one of them says relationships i def i agree and i would say because see that's totally loaded that that idea is totally loaded so now we have to go through and like now i'm not a vague person anymore you'd have to go through and dissect that because in a way the relationships that i get to create and i know what kind of relationships most people are talking about because our minds and our lives revolve around love it's all we want but when you can see all the different types of love that you have in your life at times it's you know it's lonely and i get that and i get wanting to have partnership and i get that people want to create families and i i really get the longing for love and for but you know to me and only to me it's an honor to find it but i mean animals pair up you know it's instinctual it's not again a choice that's programming and i try to not be a total servant to the programming because that to me is ingrained and like embedded and probably every woman in my family line before me probably you know i've had someone had kids nothing so that's ingrained in me but i don't actually have that idea so if i can disconnect from well that's what i'm supposed to want but i don't and i'm okay with it and i do but sitting here right now i'm just happy to sit here with you there's nothing that i'm like well you know if i had this it'd be better it's like it always would be it's always going to be better and you know what i've also learned is like when someone you know talking about timing it's like well this isn't a good time for that it's never a good time it's never a good time for your house to burn down it's never a good time to go through a divorce it's never a good time for your grandma to die it's never a good time like it's gonna happen when it happens and like acceptance and it's not gonna be easy and i've also allowed myself i've made myself sit in discomfort lately and loneliness have you done that i will really turn off all my devices everything in my house no tvs no phone no computer nothing no music and just sit and let it come up because it will and it hurts it's excruciating and i did it probably three nights ago and like you know sobbed by myself and like i felt so good the next day because you cannot do this forever and we live in a society where we're asked to just compartmentalize compartmentalize departmentalization distraction distraction distraction cannot do it exactly don't look back don't look back don't go back i mean our ancestors would have had ceremonies for a month if someone passes away and i remember my grandma died on a day that it was like right midnight sky maybe had been out for two days and i was gonna miss interviews and it's like do you think you could do that one it's like are you i have to honor my grandma who my grandma my mom was adopted and like so if my grandmother wouldn't adopted my mother like you know it's okay so and also people you know have the attachment to but like you want to have your own children you want to whatever i come from a mother who is adopted who like i have such a love for those who take in children and make them their own and give them a family to be a part of because my mom that cosmic alignment is wild that must blow your mind blows my mind because she chose her and somehow it's almost i dare to say almost as or more miraculous than having your own children because the way that you really can become a mother yeah to someone who the bi you know the kind of that biology the dna that is nurture over nature yeah exactly and like there is no doubt like my grandmother is my grandmother and i am so much like her yeah so there's something i'm like really love about it so with the relationship thing instead of allowing that to just be a preset i've tried to really push the reset button on these on these like settings that were all like we're all kind of ai i guess when did you start to do that though when did you just i mean obviously you could say that that's the po that's the frog in the pot of boiling water and then it suddenly happens but the way you've described it reset not preset it's perfect so that to me is a headline you got to get to a headline you just work up to it you just go oh my god that's not me so many great lyrics on this on this album but there's a line in there where it's bad karma to have a double life to live a double life yeah whoa okay that's a big lyric yeah i wrote that sitting in traffic i wrote that sitting in traffic and i i started with um you may think i'm ghosting but the truth is i'm a liar and it's like i saw you want to tell you but you ain't a buyer and like it was just the truth and i got to the studio and mark so many times just like oh my god like i actually have cold-blooded tattooed because i heard the word cold-blooded so much when i was making this record max calling you cold this is from mike will and he goes man you man dog you are cold-blooded and i thought i'm gonna go write that so i wrote a song called cold blood and it's not on the record well if we're talking about cold-blooded let's just double down let's go at the table and talk about the line i always pick a giver yeah cause i've always been a taker yeah i have to i'd rather just do it i'll think about it later kiss me bad karma i had written this song like i think i was driving i was driving to mark's place in hollywood and then i revisited it after i hadn't thought about it for a little while when i was in new york on electric lady he started just playing through the speakers like i bet you forgot about this you know your freaking musical vomit that you've created over at my studio and he presses play and i just start hearing like ah and then with joan when i i got joan jenn on the song it was like because he kept saying like this is the most miley record of all time and i thought there's only one person who could own this record more than me it's joan jet because that's who instilled that mentality into me yeah cherry bomb yeah you know and it's like i don't give a damn about my bad reputation that's what that song is you know i own it yeah never and i just by the way you wish you had it yeah you don't like it cause you wish you were free like me yeah yeah even the bridge is saying like i don't give a [ __ ] i don't believe in luck that's why i do what i want to do i actually don't believe in karma because if karma was real i think we'd see it more play out than it does i think that sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't like i mean to me i wrote that actually i wrote that when donald trump became president because that's the day i kind of thought karma might not be real but don't you identify to some degree with buddhism yeah applied elements of that faith to your lifestyle i just haven't always seen karma play out in the life that you're in right now but that's the whole point of the camera is you know you might not see it it's probably gonna come back in another life and that's why i said i'd rather do it i'll think about it later i'll think about in the next one right whoever i come back as they can deal with that what are you hoping we look back on in 10 15 20 years time when we're older i'll be much older you'll definitely be older and we look back on this and what are you hoping that this time we got out of it what's the harvest here people originally i think it was said that coronavirus was going to be an equalizer i disagree fully it showed the divide it showed health is wealth it showed the inequality it showed the injustice and i think it was just an eye-opener and i think all the issues that came to the surface they've been bubbling i mean this volcano was bound to erupt you said it yourself where sometimes you think it's the end but it's actually the beginning yeah you know i don't think it's over until it's it's over and even then we're starting yeah it's starting again and i just never believe it's over that's what i wrote in the introduction of my record and how i announced this album itself is that when something is over we usually claim it as the end but it's the beginning and i really think i do think it's the beginning yeah well at the beginning of the album starts with uh what the [ __ ] do i know yeah which i know because a little birdie told me that that was the first song you wrote for the album yeah that is that's the first song i ever wrote on there the first three songs you ever wrote for the album one two three knocked them down it happened to just be in order and i didn't even mean for it to be that way but you know in storytelling it's like makes perfect sometimes when you you're writing a book in a way you know and it's like someone goes and cuts the pages and put it around you're like what the hell is going on will you help me lyric because i don't wanna have another conversation and you probably won't play me on your station and it's all very much of the click declaration of in case you ever won that i've always been an outlier yeah and every time that you've tried to include me in your gang it's just not where i feel comfortable i mean yeah that's what i took from it yeah when it says you know um i don't want to have another conversation probably won't want to play me on your station i'm going to pour out a bottle full of my frustration here to tell you something that i don't know it was a little bit about the frustration of the unapologetic way that i do write my songs can make them feel i don't know maybe like i guess more in an alternative space you know especially this last record i would say and me being a woman and this aggressive idea then makes it in a way i mean less mainstream because there's still there's still a politeness that's expected for me as a fan i'll make it real easy you're a disrupter that's what i think and i guess when you listen to mainstream then that means that there is a stream and i don't go with that flow you don't and yet that you keep fighting every time i watch you show up to these parties and these award shows in these rooms it's a disaster it's true it's a disaster and i'm just like that to me was the perfect musical reflection of that sort of contradiction of like invite miley and it's like you really want me to come again yeah you know what's gonna happen yeah what what are you thinking in the moment when you know that you're in the middle of something there's a thrash going on that you didn't expect but damn that's just what happens that's just how you're built so what do you mean so you mean like people's reaction to my no even before that when you know you're in a situation where something's just kind of out of control and there's been a few moments where some really well publicized moments where the party you've been at the party and the party's gone south right and what do you think are you thinking like man why did i come here again or you're thinking like this is kind of why i came to disrupt things i think that and i actually learned this from marc jacobs i did a marc jacobs show and i was talking to him about you know i'm like everybody else and that's how i want to be cheating whatever he goes no you're not he's not yet you're not and he goes i can put you in jeans and a white t-shirt and a line full of people and jeans and a white t-shirt and they're going there you are and like you will never ever blend in you will always stand out even if you decide today you don't want to be you anymore you're always going to be you you're born with that you're born with a you know there's a radiation there's an aura there's a there's a power there's a force whatever you want to call it that is you so stop fighting it 27 to me was a year that i really had to protect myself that actually kind of really made me want to get sober was because we've lost so many icons at 27. it's a very like pivotal time you kind of go into that next chapter or this is it for you and i just feel that some of the artists that almost couldn't handle their own power and their own energy and their own force it's an energy people call it fame it's not it's not it's an energy and i no matter what was born with that and whether i sat here with you and this is where i am or if i was at my friend's place which is the homeless shelter in l.a that happy hippie supports i would still be me no matter what and there would be an attraction and there would be a magnetic pool that made people want to come to me that's who i am and instead of thinking of that as like some sort of you know narcissist i need to drink myself through it i need to take drugs i need to narcissism i'm the best and no one is as amazing as me that is how i feel i have so many idols like that i look up to that i just you know like stevie nicks like joan jet like debbie harry like i am no way i will never be done perfecting my craft i will never be the best because i'll never be satisfied but that's really i think that's really what it is i i'm gonna stand out no matter what so i've just embraced it instead of trying to run from it and trying to like you know join the gang yeah i mean me being a teddy bear shaking my ass in a costume me not being a teddy bear not shaking my ass would be the costume cause that's that's what it is that's what i feel when i hear that song i see a teddy bear shaking its ass and so i have to become it because that's what it is and so it would be a lie which i can't do i can't lie you can't lie i cannot lie that's why i'm really gullible it's because i assume that most people aren't lying to me because i don't lie i can't and i cannot so even if it's like yeah but those two things you said like we said you know they don't add up it's like well there's been time between them so of course they don't add up because i'm not that same the same person what about when you say you thought i was ghosting you but i was lying well you may think i'm ghosting but the truth is i'm a liar it's just about not returning text messages or returning calls so you think like that's a white lie oh you know you must have fallen off the face of the planet i'm not a flatterer that's called self-proof i'm not a flat earther i can't fall off the face of the planet bro i'm being sketchy that's not returning text on phone calls is really called self-preservation yeah but it's interesting that you say that you you simply cannot lie i know another artist who said that to me absolutely straight face like i cannot lie it is not in me to tell a lot what happens if you do that comes out just like it does for everybody else it always does does it burn you though does it just crush you it's just like ah until then you just cannot it ends up just coming out in some wack way you know it comes to bite my ass every time and it will you know i guess maybe there's karma i guess it could be but it's like lies are too loud i mean the truth always is comes out i mean i guess for me was it like that in your house when you were growing up i don't think my parents lie my dad is almost honest to a fault like if my dad doesn't want to talk to you you're gonna know you're gonna know my dad actually told me never laugh at a joke that isn't funny because that person's gonna go torture someone else with it and they're gonna have to fake laugh and now you're gonna have you're gonna have this never-ending bad joke that makes people feel uncomfortable and you're gonna have fake you're gonna be the reason why people are fake laughing and that sucks what was it like growing up in a house like that when you have a dad like that that everyone thinks they know from some music but that is the most eccentric person i've ever met which is a wonderful thing yes again i think i think you said it by you know he is like one of one and none that's yeah that's it he's the one and only and that's like been my i guess my inspiration you know you asked me about what you feel about when you step into someone's home the way that i dress like i just i want to be the only me because everyone is the only them and that's what i really don't like about this new shift of i mean social media and like posting everything and everyone beginning to morph into the same person and the same features and like uniqueness to me uniqueness is my religion like just being the one and only and i just that is not a superpower i have now this is another theory i have is that as unique as i am i'm not special because i'm in a way we're all just special so if everybody's special then one star isn't brighter than the other there's a lot of qualities about that makes mike jacobs wrong well i think i'm always gonna stand out i'm gonna stand out i think everyone has it in them right you're a real empath you are i that's why i think i think you're just an empath you just like you just want to adopt animals and you want your friends and your family to be safe and you just want all the stuff around you but but equally you don't want that to define you right yeah and i have the artist i have the artist torture thing going on too sometimes but like i'm a little conflict seeking because it's creative and like that's another thing oh you create drama in order to write by accident i don't mean to but like i like to feel the picture of someone who believed in accidents i like to feel sad sometimes like i really like it and i really like to feel happy i really like to feel and i like it because it's inspiring to me but god how do you function right now as someone who willingly puts themselves into their feelings in order to go through that process and learn something new when there's so much to feel right now it's been really overwhelming i went like three days without sleeping at one point because the energy of everything happening was just too stimulating like it's how can you sleep at times like this you know and when there's just so much to do as an activist it would be really hard for me to just like lay my head on the pillow and go into dreamland but i think dreaming is honestly it's the like pencil sharpener of the of the creativity you know your dreams i remember a lot of my dreams i remember a lot of my dreams do you write in your dreams do i write them down or like do i write in them do i write songs yeah i really think thinking way too much from younger now in a dream i dreamt that i wrote it for my sister with justin timberlake and i woke up and i'm like i'm just gonna write it and i didn't give him songwriter credit because it was dream justin timberlake he was not actually justin timberlake but i had a dream that me noah and justin timberlake wrote thinking way too much wow yeah and it's the only song i've ever written in a dream i think how do you remember a song after a dream i can i have vivid dreams and then it's like if i don't as soon as i woke up i had it stuck in my head all day i had it in my head all day long you clearly have a deep affection for the people as you say that you love and you're loyal to and yet you've hit reset on things we were talking about your dad i've also been lucky enough to to meet your mom who's amazing and when i see them in the same room i'm like wow that is just the perfect perfect union yeah so when you're in a situation where you're saying goodbye to yourself every night and searching for a new moment to apply to put yourself into but then you see this union this this loving family you came from right see that's really different too because i actually had this conversation with my mom this morning who you love and what you want can be different so my mom loves my dad more than anything they've created this family they've like look at what they've created like they've really kind of found in a way kind of a purpose of life like they really found love but what they want is very different and to say that love and agreement on a life path is the same is not i don't think so so i think my family really worked it out my dad lives in tennessee on a farm pretty secluded tripping out his best friend's name is the face it's a tree that has a face and he talks to it all day long it's true he's like you want to come hang out with the face i'm like dad you've been hanging out with the face for 35 years like i've seen it and so that's my dad and my mom her life revolves around service like she just wants to serve people and like i mean she is a mother to us five but like she's a mother to everyone that she meets like she is just that person and she has an incredible energy she wants to live fast and like they just have different choices and so my parents really taught me that love is that feeling love is that spark love is something you can't see love doesn't mean like having a standard lifestyle where you sit and have coffee together every morning so that makes me look for something else there are some love songs on this record there's some really mo there are moments when i feel that you're really getting close to truly identifying what love means to you right angels is a real moment on the record for me and this sad because i don't feel like it's there yet like you can't grab it yet yeah but you're definitely getting it identifying what it is yeah because to let go of something like and be able to write about what it means to you and let it go means you understand what it meant to you in the first place yeah you know at first i guess a lot of my songs that i write are unapologetic and i guess are shameless but not that one so at first listen you go like man she's really putting it out there like i know you're gonna wish we never met on the day i leave you're gonna think i'm cold-blooded but then it's like it's not your fault no that's what it this song is saying it there is like some remorse to it like all these things should add up on paper to you're the one for me but i know that you're wrong for me and maybe it's part of being someone that thrives in chaos or some sort of conflict with creativity i really respect you know actors that can go in and out of character and like leave it in my love life i should maybe be more like denzel washington or something you know i should be like a really good actor that can like play all these roles and then go home and leave it but isn't that the double life i think that's really what it is i have a hard time disconnecting from like yeah yeah that character or something because it's not a character it's not written for me that's the thing someone did say that to me one time like in a relationship you know this is it's like a movie i said but it's not because like it's not written out and the ending isn't folded up in a binder in these like scenes like i'm not that person that's like a movie it's like actually i don't even like watching movies that much because i'm too embedded in the truth so when i know something is a story like i i have a little bit of a hard time more of a requiem for a dream type yeah i love a documentary i love that that's the that's the truth that i love you know i've actually looks because a lot of artists they really get inspired by films actually i was working you know with max martin at one point and he was saying he actually gets inspired by writing songs by even watching movies because he's like i could write a song for that person like i don't have to destruct my own life i can write it from his perspective it's not the same i gotta light it up you know so i gotta see it through i just that's who i am even a song like prisoner you endure coming through and i and i man i mean there's some incredible songs and my favorite songs on the record are high-end angels but the biggest song on the record is prisoner yeah i mean that is just like so far out of the stadium and the ball's gone and yeah it's gone what i love about prisoner i mean i think it's also coming at a perfect time for everybody i mean in a way yeah the synergy between the subject matter on the surface and what we're dealing with here yeah we really feel too like i mean we're just trapped in our in our emotions right now i mean really me there's no escaping it and it's like you know locked up can't get you off my mind it's like anything that you've tried to suppress or compartmentalize at that point it's coming up like it's yours to own to own it or release it you know and so in a way her and i you know we have a lot of things you know in common if you kind of look at us like you know i would say our love for fashion this is like my number one um me and dua both she's probably the only person that can rival my collection of fuzzy hats like we have a love for fuzzy hats there's a fabulousness there there there's a fabness there yeah again i think that like fashion is such it's it's your inside out you know and so i think she like kind of wears her inside out and i like love that because i like when you walk into a room like she's recognizable and to me that's a star like so when i know if i if i saw that on a mannequin and i would know that's for doalippa so i love that about her i also love that she's very direct like we edited this video on text message me and her directly as artists and i just don't want to play telephone when i'm when i'm making music i want to make it with who i'm making with i don't want to do a song with someone's manager i want to do a song with the artist and so her allowing me to have that direct line of communication and then also the ability to like just trust each other like both of us i think our egos are pretty in check that she's very willing and i'm very willing and there's just also there's a lack of competition because in the ways that we're so much alike we're very different you let her stop the song we're not yeah we're not competing i'm just not like that you know um it's like we we talked about like you know me either i decide i want to walk in and i'm going to like own the room or i can just like slink into the back and camouflage in and you won't even know that i'm there you know you might notice what i'm wearing but you you are not wearing but other than that i don't have to be i mean i i don't have to always be the loudest person in the room i like to kind of slink in and like i really like to observe so i really like you know for her and i there's just no competition that changes that's just everything and there was just a there's a true partnership and then i also like that it wasn't the first song we'd cut together we actually cut other songs and she wanted to keep going until it was right until we found the one that honors our individuality that's cool most people dial in do the part bounce out wait for it to come out exactly and say how quick can we do a video there was none of the machine in it and you know she really i mean we've recorded other songs together and we just waited until we felt like now this is a this is a do a minor song and you know and you can just everything about it reflects us i mean there's even something to me like how i talk about like fashion being a way to like flip yourself inside out the colors that i see i see when i listen to a song i'd see colors oh don't ask me to say what that is because i can never pronounce it write synthesis yeah that's why my studio looks like this on the top because that's what i see all the time wow they're actually a little hidden is that what your dad sees do you think uh hopefully these are all vaginas i'm not sure that he sees that he's a vagina yeah they're all supposed to kind of be the portal of the womb that's where i came from that's where i think i'm from that's a news flash it's where we are that's where we came from well this is the cosmic vagina the vagina before you get to the humanly yeah the green in there it's kind of what i saw when i was making prisoner like this song was it was like very green and purple and it had a lot of color like very strobey like it really wasn't like when i've written certain songs it's just this like pale blue and there's a sense of like close your eyes and this comes to you yeah and so when i close my eyes and hear it there was like a there's like a strobiness to it and like i can kind of see it now but it would go between this like really deep purple to this neon green like kind of quickly and neither of those really represent me so i didn't really know where they were coming from but like it was just i really felt it and when i think of her those are kind of like the colors that i think of like i think of like neons when i think of her maybe it's a part of like i don't know the radiance or like the power i don't know i kind of like vibe off people's levels of like charisma yeah and so like some people's charisma is really overwhelming and i see like when dew is around that her charisma there's no sense of like desperation to it of like i've got to be the best because if i'm not what if there's like a calmness to her success which i really like because i feel like when you can tell someone is too much of a trying to or like a survivalist like yeah yeah that i don't like there are some of the world's biggest pop stars have that it's in the eyes and there's this ego but it's more it's not actually an ego it's insecurity and it's it's fear yeah it's fear it's fear it's like when you're one one point down with 30 seconds to go and you've got the ball i do not like that energy for me like just doesn't work because how do you explain it's because it's not like confidence and it's not security it's something deeper than that it's like someone said to me one time too like you're such a free spirit like you can't be held down and i said that's actually not true like i really like to be anchored and i like to be weighted i actually am not a free spirit i'm probably my idea of structure is maybe a little looser than but to me i feel like i have structure in my life and i wouldn't say that i'm just a free spirit like i would like to work on maybe even my ability to go with the with the flow because i don't get a sense that after 2017 2018 was a step towards structure make no mistake about it i have the idyllic house the ideal location my marriage and that i'm writing the music but this is going to be the routine yeah that all burns to the ground and ends yeah i don't feel like the person i'm sitting here is reacting to that i feel like you're still taking the good parts of that yeah i think i mean i also like rules and i i was looking at uh when i was reading that book about joan jett she actually said that she was a rule follower and i thought that was really funny because i kind of thought it was like anti everything but i actually really like rules like if it tells me not to park somewhere i'm not parking there if it tells me to go a speed limit i will always go to speed on it like i like rules you can't drive fast i don't i drive the speed limit i'm kind of lame like i drive the speed limit i think because i've caused so much trouble i no longer have a desire to be in trouble like i hate the feeling you get when you know you're in trouble i got in trouble a lot as a kid and i got into trouble a lot like last year yesterday i don't know man i mean i've got i guess disruption is what it is and i've i've maybe even caused a little like trouble in my life but it's made the outcome worth it so like i'm all i'm all content all the time but i don't want to like i don't i don't want to go to jail you know i don't want to i don't want to do anything like that right so it's based out of fear i'd race out of fear i don't i don't want to get a parking ticket it sounds annoying you know i also think it's a sign of respect yeah i like respect so that's why i like rules because if someone is doing it by it being caring i think you know there can be overbearing obviously abusive rules like you know what some people just like to be in such control and tell you what to do i don't like those kind of rules but i like rules that are gonna prolong my life i'd like i like rules that are gonna benefit me and to protect other people and that's why i love the damn mask i love the mask because it's a sign of respect by people wearing a mask you're saying i love you you know i just think it's a sign of respect a sign of compassion a sign of you know kindness and like i just think it's about being a good person when you were 27 you needed you so brought because you felt like you were in a pathway that could have been a very sort of well-established self-destructive pathway that occurs within the artistic spirit where energy is too big to maintain and so you end up losing your balance with really tragic outcome you want to stick within the guidelines that are set for us because they keep us safe you want to be able to live a long life what's your relationship like with the idea of mortality as somebody who lives in the moment as much as you do i think that fear is just a part of instinct like we're talking about i mean a fear of of death is instinctual and it's programmed and that's you know it's it's we are all survivalists actually there's a a concept that says everybody is in it for themselves it's just the more sophisticated that do a better job of hiding it which i think is really funny are you a survivalist could you live off the land could you go and do it if so if i had to yeah if i had to yeah i mean because when someone's like i could never it's like but you would that's the thing and that's what the glastonbury concept is of a finder i would never do it do it and then find that place inside yeah and like if i had to i would do anything you know that's it there's nothing else you would do you will do anything really but maybe that's who i am look at you showing up with billy idol this is a guy i mean he was one of the first concerts i ever went to was a kid man him and steve stevens out on that stage it was just it was like to me they were like leonard mccartney i know these people are gonna be flipping out back then but it was the 80s the beatles weren't around anymore len and mccartney man it was like watching those two vibe off each other and playing those smashes it was unbelievable um what's the billy idol connection here because i know that you and joan just have obviously got to know each other over the years but how's billy idol show up on youtube so billy billy's kind of the same thing me and billy have known each other i think the first time i ever did anything for billy idol was in like 2013 right i actually think that's when i just dyed my hair platinum and like shaved my head i had like short little spiky hair and i looked like billy idol almost like that yeah kind of like that even more billy vibes like i was pretty androgynous you know and and i like really used him as a inspiration for my my kind of like the transformation that i had that was a big part of that for me like his his music because the way that he kind of married like rebellion but also his music where they had like incredible hooks and like showed me that i could have balance that i could make music that i and other people love and like sometimes i've lost that and i found it again where it's like i want to make music for me but it's like part of music is sharing like you know it's not hoarding these songs it's sharing and so eyes without a face actually followed me around for like a year anytime i would go anywhere it would be playing like in a it was really trippy i really started to think that life is just all i mean it's the truman concept i'm like who the hell keeps keeping playing on eyes without a face like i'd go to the grocery i go to a restaurant anywhere i went it would be playing and then i went to the studio with what i had said i had just been going through like all different relationships and just figuring it out and i was telling him that i felt like i thought that billy idol music videos are like porn like i think the old billy idol music videos are so sexy and i'm like yo that like that is my that is my porn preference is billy idol music videos and so i'm like oh man we got to write a song about that and he's like let's just write a song with billy idol let's just like get the real deal here thanks so we we got billy to come and um write a song and actually did you tell him about the music videos and the concept music videos i think when i fell off and was drinking there was a moment where i told billy idol check it out that is music videos are porn i did actually yeah i did um and yep over dinner this is a regular polite dinner conversation the chorus um where it says he says under the disco ball the disco ball i have is in my house in nashville tennessee and me and watt were separate for new year's i was in tennessee and he was in l.a and we were facetiming under the disco ball saying we're making the best record of all time like 2020 is our year we're gonna make this album we're so stoked and we were under the disco ball yeah so all i wanted and then my other favorite story is uh ryan tedder wrote this with us and we're like all in the studio and we're like hey billy like can we just get a couple ad-libs and he goes yeah yeah and we're like please say someone was recording this and we got it and that was his real response to it was like an ad lib you can't even say yeah without going yeah yeah yeah yeah exactly i imagine ian asked me from the cult was like that you're like do you want to be in here go yay yeah it's like it's for real it's like really he cannot just say like yeah sure yeah yeah what's the golden g string we wrote this song it probably was in 2017 2018 something like that and probably this again is kind of reflective of donald trump as president and you know the men hold all the cards and they implant jen you know and they kind of determine your fate this song which is also about kind of the um i guess like the cross i've had to bear in a way of like saying like i feel like everything that i've done has just been up for you know all the opinions and i guess people being offended and like all the [ __ ] but it's like you know our president grabs women by the and you're mad at me i'm a pop star i'm supposed to do these things i'm supposed to do things that like are sometimes make you uncomfortable or you take offense that's kind of my job that's like entertainment i don't want that in a leader you know i consider myself a leader but i would say that actually is creating the like country that we're going to live in you you you don't want an entertainer i don't i have no desire to be president because i have only a desire to create art and to be an artist and to i want to do what i do and i think that there's an idea that i've kind of focused on of mastery of like finding the thing that you love and like becoming the best at it you can't be everything i think it's great and i think i don't know what next year is about i'm really glad you're putting some out i still know artists that won't i still know artists that are just like i just can't i understand i do too i understand they just they just like i can't do it and then not bring it to life and play it and do what i do and but i live for challenges and this is creatively challenging time and i would think that a lot of the performance i've been able to pair with my music i hope are timeless like i really hope they're not coated with this covered i think i said this to what i've been on mine me saying i gave him a compliment and you were complimented mark and everyone i said this is an album where i feel that the performer and you has been set free there have been times when i've heard your music in the past and i've been trying to compare and contrast to when i see you when it's do or die when you're on the mic and you're singing and it's you and it's like if i don't get this right it's disaster and you just go somewhere else and then i hear these perfectly constructive pop songs and i it feels like you're constrained a little bit sometimes it really came with age and that's what we talked about with time we talked about timing and like i had some growing up to do you know and i did it and i am still in the process of it that was who i was and who i had been and people had loved me for making pop music you know partying the usa and like we can't stop and that was a part of a staple of my career that gave me some security i mean that's another thing we all want right so we want like love we want you know at the time when you're making those records that they were serving a different purpose that wasn't necessarily an internal journey but more a journey for security i knew that i wasn't listening to songs like that in my own time i knew that like at home i've never listened to we can't stop one time i've never but i [ __ ] love it it gives me this like look you know it gives me a platform like and i love what it gives to people i love what people feel when they listen to it i love what it meant to me at the time actually at the time so see now these are where things are allowed to change and like i can say an idea and now i don't totally commit to my idea so now the new commitment of the idea is that playing a character for so long like i was a character and people loved me as a character i have a hard time not associating that certain songs that i don't relate to anymore were just another character that people love more than they love the real me so there's like the fear base of like people will never love me as much as they love that because that level of success is is such an eclipse sometimes it can eclipse anything that i ever make because when something is so bright and something is so big like hannah montana or like pardon the usa or like we can't stop or wrecking ball and and then every time i make a music video someone wondering is she gonna make another wrecking ball right is it ever going to be like that again i may like i don't know if i'll ever make that you're giving away your narrative that that's the thing you're giving away the thing that you owned when you made it in the first place then it becomes everybody else's and then you get scared that they just want that and you don't own it anymore it's not yours to own and yet when we spoke around younger now i remember distinctly saying to you that moment when you get up in your backyard and you sing with whoever it is or on your own it is the most pure like what the [ __ ] moment like you've got this fire in you when you sing which is unbelievable second to none almost in your peer group and i think that's right how did that [ __ ] away i remember three years ago i gave you that compliment you're like yeah yeah i like to go on the beach and sing all my acoustic guitars but i also like to make big fancy part records whatever i think that's why i get sad a little bit when i put the record out is because it's really is life and death it's birth and death at the same time so like when you create a record now it's turned in it's burned on cds it's burned on thousands of cds already it's no longer mine it's everyone else's and all the ideas are out here now like they're not in its safe little place again control like it's not in its vault anymore it's not in its vault and it is not my precious secret anymore you know and that is sometimes painful because my favorite part of the process is just singing and making music because i really don't know how i sing i never really like focus much on like training or understanding or reading music or you know my grandma plays piano by ear my dad plays guitar just by what he's taught himself like it's just it's genetic and like it my voice comes from a place that i really don't know how when it comes out like my pitch is just there and i don't think about it like it just it just comes out and i don't really know where it comes from it's almost like you know like spider-man like discovering that if he goes like this he's got the web it's like you know it's that it's that like i didn't even know i mean but even even spider-man is like a he's a showman you know he's like an entertainer so like you want to see that show you want the costume you want the whole thing and so for me that's why i [ __ ] love dolly parton is because she has it all that to me is just an ultimate icon because she's never lied her songs are the truth even if they don't resonate with her now like maybe they're she's attacked from something she's written before that's what happens when you have a career like that's as expanded as hers but she just found this balance of being she is a superhero like she almost has a character but it's true and that's why i love drag queens because that's what debbie harry loves jacqueline's debbie harry when she created blondie that was creating like a drag character because she's like you know i'm like in a dirty band t-shirt in my apartment writing songs but like when i become blondie and then that makes it sound different i write songs in like all different ways but like when i write songs not only do i see color but like i'll see what lipstick i have on because i see the who's gonna whose mouth it's gonna come out of like i see not the person that's like you know last night i was in a you know a sweatshirt like recording stevie nicks but i'm not in my mind in my mind i'm not in my mind we are like in our witch realness and like i'm totally in stevie's vibe and i've got a hat on and my hair is long and i'm like the moon is full and there's like wild dogs everywhere and we're part of it and we're one of them and that's what i where i am i'm not in here so like wow really like when i write a song that's why sometimes it's even nice to write in unfamiliar places like you know i'll write i'll that's why i said i don't really write songs in here that much yeah like i don't really write songs in the studio i write songs in the car because they're just gonna come to you like you know but i think by feeling that because in a song like when you're writing a song you can go anywhere in your like imagination yeah look when we spoke three years ago i was like oh we're gonna get to this and so this is another step towards this and it's like just to be in a situation where i have no idea what time it is i haven't thought about it for a second for me it's just like been a very fluid conversation about process around this album which really just finds you at a point in your life where it's self-awareness and acceptance and freedom acceptance keeps finding me like that word it's the it's the eyes without a face of words it will not quit like everywhere i go and mindfulness yeah so mindfulness is following me also like i got just totally zoned into mindfulness over the last maybe four weeks and it's changed my life and my final thing that i'll say of what's been extremely helpful to me is the best way to stay open is to never close so last night i had to say that to myself repeatedly when i was like cutting midnight sky i don't know what it was it was something about it that i don't know what i was really getting like creatively blocked and like for some reason when midnight sky started playing i just started crying like i don't even really know why i guess maybe the the fact that stevie nicks is on the record like blew my mind but i also i don't want to be an amateur therapist but also it came out at a pretty dramatic time for your family when you lost someone close to you around the scene yeah i realized that the person that wrote it isn't the person that's recunting it now and listening to it and the way that's already and that made me sad you know because i was like i'm listening to it and a lot has changed already like when things are different i'm really affected by it and like just by losing someone relationship changes obviously there's a big change in the country going on like a exchange of power and there's just all this going on and i'm like last night when the song started playing in a way when i wrote it i mean but it's just another one we remember the past better than it was present worse than it is and future more resolved than it ever will be and so when i look at the past i'm like when i wrote that song it was simpler times and these are so complicated there was a laundry list if you would have asked me when i wrote midnight sky that's why i was writing it was i just want to be in control of my narrative so bad i i hate when the media creates my autobiography for me like no stop writing my life that's what creates the anxiety though exactly that is the root of it which ultimately man if it's one thing i'm learning as i'm growing as i'm getting on in my life and and my kids are growing up and everything else it's like as and where you can apply those two words that sit there just waiting to be used and are always at arm's reach which i'll let go yeah i love that that's why i wrote you know on my record it's like i think you're really gonna like this record but if you don't [ __ ] you because it's like i [ __ ] love it and i think there is a balance i think that is the car like to me like the best you know carly simon like i love you're so vain because i love that the chorus you know that's as iconic as happy birthday like that is like the simplest most mainstream amazing but the verses are so weird and like so storytelling and that's the one thing that i thought me andrew watt andrew wyatt mark ronson you know we really found on this album is that i dolly parton i've inherited this song writing i grew up listening johnny cash i grew up with nina john jett and i i have that in me but also like i've also grown up listening to gwen stefani who really did that kind of best you know she got to just have the best of both worlds to not be ashamed of anything yeah um she really did and how to find that merch how to be everything how to be the melting pot of everything that i've ever loved and not be ashamed of like some of my guilty pleasures of music that you know that i've wanted to that have inspired me and like how to make it my own and just a sense of like the shame just it doesn't it's not helpful so i guess what started that tangent was that originally the shame came out and now i'm just getting a little more hyper aware to go like oh no i actually don't feel that way detached attached from that i have a fear of writing new music because what i've been is so large um not anymore no i'm really excited for this record to come out because it's just i it's the most proud i could be of anything and you know again i just feel like just so much gratitude towards the collaborators who helped me create it you know here's the thing you'll make another one yeah and another one i already am i already am this song was this album was 12 songs long somehow i think it's 15 right now it's i've added three songs since it came out twelve plus two covers twelve two covers and now midnight's guys stevie nicks so now when i printed this record two weeks ago it was a twelve song album it's 15. so that's the great thing about digital you're already making another one i can just keep adding i love it [Music] watch os 8 is set to bring some new features to your apple watch including a new mindfulness app some extra workout types as well as messaging improvements so let's dive in and see what's new so first up these features will be coming to the full release of watch os 8 which is expected sometime in the fall if you are a developer though you can download the developer beta right now and the public beta will be available sometime in july and there is good news if you own a series 3 because watch os 8 will be compatible with the series 3 and later so that's good news if you are an owner of an older apple watch so let's talk about some of those smart features first up so you'll be able to use car key with the apple watch so it's going to utilize the ultra wide band or uwb chip in the apple watch series 6 and you'll be able to do things remotely with your vehicle as long as your vehicle is compatible including things like locking or unlocking your car maybe it's turning on the air conditioning or even starting your engine the wallet app will also get a bit of an overhaul as well you'll be able to add not only keys for your home and maybe even your office badge but also hotel keys you can access those on your wrist and similar to how we've seen in ios 15 you'll also be able to access your digital id if you decide to put that on your phone or watch you can use your driver's license or state issued id at certain tsa checkpoints you'll be able to use the watch and not have to physically carry your wallet if you don't want to [Music] now this came as a surprise to me the photos watch face is actually the most popular watch face for users on the apple watch at least according to apple and so now what you'll be able to do is make a portrait mode watch face so you can take a portrait mode photo taken on the iphone and put that as your watch face on the apple watch and then the watch is going to use segmentation to be able to separate the subject from the background so you'll be able to see more details that will pop out of the screen a little bit more and if you like to fidget with the digital crown and interact with the watch face you can make the subject kind of move in and out a little bit and the watch face will also know where to place things like the time so you'll probably see that on certain watch faces that the time will actually appear just behind the head of your subject which is a nice touch speaking of photos the photos app is also updated on the apple watch you'll also be able to now share images from that app through mail or messaging itself from the watch and you'll also have collections like memories and featured photos synced from the iphone to the apple watch one of the big headlines for watch os 8 is this new mindfulness app this actually houses the breathe app which you might already be familiar with from the apple watch as well as a new reflect app i like to think of reflect a little bit like a yogi or a guru on your wrist it's giving you some prompts to make you think of positive times or positive thoughts focusing on your breath or particular moments in your life for example to help you relax and also reflect both the breathe and the reflect part of the mindfulness app will give you some tips on what you can do to help improve and you'll be able to see a mindfulness minutes log within the health app on the iphone that will bring in information from those sessions that you've done on the apple watch as well as third-party meditation apps ios 15 has this new mode called focus that helps you limit distractions and only have notifications from certain people or certain apps coming through now that will also carry over to the apple watch you'll be able to see that in the control center from the apple watch just by swiping up from the home screen and of course it will sync automatically with whatever setting you already have set on the iphone there'll also be more suggestions based on how you use the watch so for example if you start say a workout it might pop up and say maybe you would want to put on the fitness focus method so not so many distractions get in the way of your workout speaking of workouts there are two new workout types the first is tai chi and the second one is pilates you might be thinking wait there was already a pilates mode in that other section on the apple watch well these two new workout types have custom algorithms that are actually determining your effort rather than the more generic movement types that were counted previously taking into account your heart rate and movement these ones are specific for these particular activities and if you use fitness plus which is apple's subscription service that is all to do with fitness classes and workouts that works directly with the apple watch there are now a picture in picture mode some new filters as well as some specific playlists based around certain artists like lady gaga some other health features to talk about include a new sleep respiration rate now we did see sleep tracking debut on the watch os 7 last year but that was really just focused on things like making you more aware of your bedtime routine and creating some healthy habits it didn't really dive that deep into data like some other fitness trackers were doing you would really be able to see things like resting heart rate and your blood oxygen level overnight if you were wearing this series 6 for example but now you'll be able to see sleep respiration rate and you'll be able to get an idea of trends over time now apple hasn't specifically said this is designed to identify anything like any potential issue it's just to give you an idea of your overall health and determine some trends but maybe potentially it could be used to help look at conditions such as sleep apnea again not a medical device and it would be used in conjunction with your doctor but the more information the better now let's talk about some of the new messaging tools you'll be able to use a combination of dictation emojis and the scribble tool to be able to send and also edit messages you can now send teeny tiny animated gifs or gifs from your wrist and the contacts app is now available on the apple watch and if you're using dictation to send a message you'll now be able to edit that message once the transcription pops up on your screen i know i will definitely be using this quite a lot because someone with an accent you know it's not 100 accurate with getting what i'm trying to say one other app that has been redesigned is the home app so you'll be able to see a lot of your home devices on the one screen it will also re-prioritize the devices and how they show up so if you use say a home pod in your living room much more than any other device in your house it will surface that towards the top and it will start to learn over time which ones that you're using the most you can control different accessories room by room on your watch and if you have a home kit camera you'll be able to see those cameras directly from the watch face itself and here's a feature to help annoy friends family children and pets in your home it is intercom you'll be able to essentially page different rooms devices in each room or the entire house itself to send your voice messages so no more being late for dinner there's just no excuse anymore [Music] [Laughter] and finally just a bit of a laundry list of all the other features that we're getting multiple timers finally thank you so much i'm so i don't know why it took this for so long but i'm just so glad that we now have the ability to set multiple timers on the watch now more of the apps are going to support the always on display so if you have a series 5 or series 6 or later you will now be able to see some other apps surface on that screen such as maps the phone app the timers and the mindfulness app and a couple more and one final feature coming to watch os 8 that we did see announced a couple of weeks ago is assistive touch now this uses accelerometers and gyroscopes and heart rate sensors in the apple watch itself to let users navigate the watch without having to physically touch the watch screen itself or interact with any of the physical controls so those are the main new features of coming to watch os 8. i would love to hear what you think are you excited about these new features or do you think that they're just incremental updates of course you can let me know in the comments below we'd love to hear your thoughts and stay tuned we will have more hands-on with watch os 8 and lots more updates from apple's wwdc or worldwide developers conference here on cnet [Music] we have the iphone 13 specs and pricing revealed and i'll be sharing the details right after this [Music] the design was leaked early on for the iphone 13 but some specs along with the pricing have still been uncertain but thankfully today we've got some news that shed some light on what we can expect before we get started though please like the video if you're an apple fan let me know in the comments what device you're actually watching today's video on and if you haven't already then don't forget to hit subscribe so you don't miss a thing so first story of the day is that model numbers have been revealed for the iphone 13 after an eec filing and interestingly enough there were seven model numbers logged now we'd expect to see four or eight given that there are actually four different models of the iphone and this is normally for 4g and 5g versions or different ones between different regions now it could be because the iphone 13 mini is not going to be appearing in all regions or it could also be that the iphone 13 pro max has higher end 5g and it supports all of the bands so there may only be one sku last week we also had battery capacities revealed by digital chat station and now we've got confirmation thanks to 3c certification now he's proved his reliability again as the certification reveals that the iphone 13 mini has a 406 milliamp hour battery the iphone 13 and the 13 pro have a 3095 milliamp hour battery and on the iphone 13 pro max we get a 4 352 milliamp hour battery so it's great news to see higher capacities across the whole range and something that was definitely needed for the pro to help with the extra consumption from 120 hertz now next up we've got a full spec sheet and price leak for the whole of the iphone 13 series the leak apparently comes from an industry insider and was reported by giz china but they give no detail of who it was the spec sheet covers ram storage display and pricing details for all four models and it's actually the first pricing leak we've had now there's no way to confirm this leak but it actually looks like they've literally just watched one of my youtube videos and copied the details into a spec sheet and even used the images from my video if we look at the iphone 13 mini it's exactly the same spec for spec as my video they've used my estimated prices and they've even used the images that i made in photoshop we can confirm this as the home screen is the same the widgets are the same and this is the screenshot i took myself and you can see from the weather widget it's bristol which is where i live when it comes to the standard iphone 13 again the specs and pricing are exactly the same and it's the same image i used in my video and then on the 13 pro and the 13 pro max the specs and pricing are the same i used in my video and i actually used the same images for both phones in my video and they've done exactly the same on the spec sheet so to summarize this leak is completely fake or some of the specs we go through are based on leaks the information we don't have is estimated i was excited to see this spec sheet and it wasn't until i started trying to verify it that i realized how fake it was now we do have more information from recent certification though so we're now going to run through the updated specs design and the pricing to help you guys decide if this is the phone for you so first up we've got the iphone 13 mini with the iphone 13 mini we get a 5.4 inch oled display it's expected to have a 2340 by 1080 resolution and this gives us 465 pixels per inch but it's only going to be a 60 hertz display on the front we get a notch that's going to house the selfie camera and face id and on the back we get a dual camera setup with a wide and an ultra wide camera it will of course be powered up by the new a15 bionic and it's expected to come with four gigabytes of ram and a choice of 64 128 or 256 storage it's coming with a 2 406 milliamp hour battery with at least 20 watt fast charge and it will support wireless charging we get bluetooth 5g and wi-fi 6 and the phone is of course going to ship with ios 15. i'm expecting the iphone 13 mini to start from around 700 but i'll update the price as soon as we get an accurate leak next up we get the standard iphone 13. with the iphone 13 we get a 6.1 inch oled display it's expected to have a 2532 up by 1170 resolution and this gives us 460 pixels per inch but again it's only a 60 hertz display on the front we get a notched house a selfie camera and the face id and on the back we've got a dual camera setup with a wide and an ultra wide camera it will of course be powered by the new a15 bionic and we get four gigabytes of ram and a choice of 64 128 or 256 storage it's coming with a 3095 milliamp hour battery with at least 20 watt fast charging and again it does support wireless charging we get bluetooth 5g and wi-fi 6 and the phone is going to ship with ios 15. i'm expecting the iphone 13 start from 800 but again i'll update the prices as soon as we get an accurate leak next up we've got the iphone 13 pro with the iphone 13 pro we get a 6.1 inch oled display but this time it's got a 2532 by 1170 resolution which gives us 460 pixels per inch but on the iphone 13 pro it's going to be a 120 hertz ltpo display on the front we get a notch to house the selfie camera and the face id and on the back we get a triple camera setup as well as a lidar scanner the configuration is going to be made up of a wide angle an ultra wide and a telephoto camera it will of course be powered by the a15 bionic and it's expected to come with six gigs of ram and a choice of 128 256 512 and even one terabyte storage it's coming with a 3095 milliamp hour battery with at least 20 watt fast charge and wireless charging is supported we get bluetooth 5g wi-fi 6 and it's of course going to ship with ios 15. i'm expecting the iphone 13 pro to start from around 1050 but again this is just an estimate finally we have the iphone 13 pro max with the iphone 13 pro max we get a 6.7 inch oled display it's expected to have 2778 by 1128 resolution and this gives us 458 pixels per inch now again this is going to be a 120 hertz ltpo display on the front we get the notch with selfie camera and face id and on the back we get a triple camera setup plus the lidar scanner the configurations can be made up of a wide an ultra wide and a telephoto camera like the pro it's coming with the a15 bionic it's expected to come with six gigs of ram and a choice of 128 256 512 or one terabyte storage it's coming with a 4 352 milliamp hour battery and again we expect at least 20 watt fast charge as well as wireless charging we get bluetooth 5g wi-fi 6 and the phone chips with ios 15. now this is the most premium and we're expecting the iphone 13 pro max to start from around 1 150 but again i'll confirm this as soon as we get a leak so it's great that we've got so much information on the iphone 13 series with launch in september it's not too long until the official reveal from apple thankfully there is expected to be plenty of stock for the iphones and apple are reportedly not going to be affected by the chip shortage that is causing so many other companies problems as always though i'd like to know your thoughts in the comments so who out there is excited for the iphone 13 and what model you're waiting for but thanks for watching the video if you liked it smash a thumbs up if you didn't hit the thumbs down twice and i'll see you guys in the next one [Music] you Phew!

[Music] apples next big product Apple glasses rumors surrounding apples AR glasses have been circulating throughout the tech world for years despite such speculations spanning over a period that feels like a lifetime it seems that we might be finally on the cusp of Apple's next big product release a recent leak has revealed the most in-depth look to date at Apple's potential wearable AR device although the majority of leaks should be taken with a pinch of salt in current types these have come from a highly respected and credible source so here's what we know so far Apple's AR glasses will be known simply as Apple glass which is a rather fitting title given the Apple watch however this name is incredibly reminiscent of Google glass which was Google's attempt at a similar device Apple glass is said to be the final name for the glasses however I wouldn't put it past Apple to change the label last-minute eye gloves would be especially in line with the brand and might make more sense when we look at how the glasses will operate but we'll get to that later in the video design wise Apple glass which is what we will label them for the time being is expected to be a sleek and stylish as any other offering from the tech giant leet prototypes look very much like a traditional pair of glasses friendly and approachable as opposed to overly futuristic in an attempt to really appeal to the masses prototypes are being manufactured in black and white plastic although this material is likely to be swapped out for something more premium such as aluminium or some sort of composite as we near closer towards production it's also a possibility that Apple will offer multiple frame materials for buyers to choose from similar to what is offered with the Apple watch in the form of different straps all of the house tech will fit seamlessly into the frames of Apple glass with the most notable being the lidar sensor which was it atop the right-hand side of the glasses for those of you who are not familiar lidar at the most basic level it's a system that can 3d map an environment by calculating the distance between different points the lidar found inside of Apple's latest products gives us a great look as to what we can expect to find inside the first gen of Apple glass advanced lidar technology will make using Apple glass a are a breeze with no need to scan your environment before placing objects measuring or virtually visualizing making for seamless interactions between the wearer and their surroundings lidar will also take care of things like reading hand gestures and translating QR codes into dimensional images on the latest iPad fro the lidar scanner and pair of cameras work hand-in-hand however Apple glass is not expected to house any camera or photographic features the general thinking behind this is that people will take negatively to talking face-to-face with someone wearing a face mounted camera that may or may not be recording this is something that I can certainly relate to however I can't help but imagine how cool it would be to have an eye level camera that can record what you see whenever you please some are saying that cameras might start to make their way onto the Apple glass as they become more popular and widely accepted but this is strictly speculation so only time will tell charging and the batteries of the Apple glass is said to happen through the use of a designated charging stand or through the use of a wireless charging case both would be a suitable companion to the glasses and seeing as the first models are expected to have a battery life on the shorter side having a convenient charging dock or carry case would be a much welcomed addition in regards to audio Apple glass is not expected to have any built-in speakers or headphones Apple's recent developments where there must have air pod pros suggests that they're converted Wireless in air headphones will instead be pushed as part of the experience this might seem as if Apple is doing all they can to snag an extra product sale however including any kind of built-in headphone will most definitely ruin the everyday wearable design not to mention add unnecessary weight to the product now getting to the important bits you might be wondering how the glasses are actually going to function the majority of data processing is set to take place on a puppet iPhone which will not only reduce the physical footprint of the glasses but will also significantly reduce their cost overall to facilitate this we're expected to see some sort of short-range Wi-Fi capability to be built into the iPhone 12 and future iPhones thereafter older devices will likely be supported as well but are predicted to offer limited capabilities or reduced performance as technology improves over time we may eventually see all processing take place independently within the classes but this will probably take a few versions as it did with the Apple watch despite a few people being hands-on with the Apple glass prototypes there is very little known about the glasses user interface what we do know is that starboard is supposedly going to be the interfaces name which is not all that different from iOS is springboard UI what most are expecting to see is a slimmed down version of the basic iOS that we are all familiar with again somewhat reminiscent of what we can see on Apple watch but with physical interactions being replaced with hand gestures and voice command a massive feature that is incredibly exciting is that Apple glass is expected to be released with embedded displays in each lens as opposed to projected ones that were seen in Google glass the result of this should amount to far crisper visuals and a more immersive experience overall the display is also said to only be visible to the wearer and will be completely invisible to any outside viewers now I'm sure that you're all wondering how much a pair of these AR glasses are going to cost so let me put you out of your misery and tell you that it's probably a lot less than you might think the first gen Apple glass is set to retail at a rather reasonable price of just 499 dollars excluding the price of optional prescription lenses this is still a premium for a device that relies heavily upon another much more expensive device but it's still low enough to be widely adopted and to gain traction as a popular mainstream purchase Apple has had very little to say about Apple glass as a whole so speculation surrounding its release date is to be expected whilst we may finally be given an official announcement by Apple introducing Apple glass as early as this year it's highly likely that we won't see them available to purchase until q4 2021 at the earliest and may even stretch into 2022 Lisey's Story is my favorite. It always has been. At its core, this is a love story. It's a story of a woman's courage, who would do almost anything
to save her husband's life and sanity. Lisey is a different thing for me. It's very close to my heart. I had pneumonia around the year 2000 and came really close to stepping out. When I came home from the hospital, my wife had cleaned out my study. and I thought to myself, "I've died. I'm a ghost." And the idea for Lisey's Story
came from that, particularly the idea that writers,
when they make things up, they go to a different world. I wanted to tell the story
that was in the book, but I wanted to make it better. I thought if somebody was
going to mess it up, I used to tell my wife,
"Nobody's going to mess it up but me." The story of Scott's childhood,
when he finally tells it, is particularly horrific. He retreats into this fantasy world. Boo'ya Moon is his secret place. It's a place that's very,
very beautiful, and at the same time,
very dangerous. It's a very scary story, in a lot of ways. It's scary in a supernatural way, but it's also scary because... there really are
dangerous people out there. Lisey's Story could only have come
from the mind of Stephen King. It's beautiful and haunting, and romantic and horrifying. When I think of Lisey's Story,
like I think of Stephen King, and how is this connected with his life. It was a lot of pressure, too. We wanted to make sure
that we did him justice, and that we did the story justice. I'm a visual writer. I'm interested in
the power of the imagination. We can talk about it as
otherworldly and fantastic. He's like,
"Oh, no, it's real. It's real." , we're taking
this versatility further, making iPad even more capable
and more intuitive, and we started right
on the home screen with widgets. They offer beautiful,
glance-able information at just the right moments, and this year,
we have a big update. Now you can freely place widgets among the apps
on your home screen. This is a huge deal! Let me show you how it works. Okay. Here I am on the home screen. You can see that I already have
a few widgets placed along the top. Let's start by adding a widget. I'll bring up
the widget gallery. Here you'll notice
some new widgets like the beautiful new
Find My widget and the Contacts widget which helps you reach family
and friends with just a tap. Let's find a good spot for this,
towards the top here. Now, I'll go back to the gallery
and grab the Parcel widget for tracking
my incoming packages right on the home screen. Perfect. Now, of course a bigger canvas
means more room for widgets, so we're adding a new,
larger format for widgets designed just for iPad's
larger display. Here's the new
Apple TV widget. I can easily dive into
my favorite shows with a tap, and here's my gaming page. The new Game Center widget lets me jump
into my games faster and discover what to play
with friends. And check out the new
large-size Photos widget. It really puts my favorite
photos front and center, and with this larger
Files widget, I can keep tabs
on all of my work projects. Now, with pages full of
these great widgets, some of my less frequently used
apps have gotten pushed
to later pages. We wanted to make it easier
to get to all of your apps, so we brought App Library
to iPad. You can see all my apps
are here, automatically categorized
for me. And what's really cool is we
built access to App Library right into the Dock, no matter where you are, you can always get to your apps. And now that you have
App Library, you can hide pages
that you no longer need... just like this. And even reorder them
right from here. That's widgets and App Library. We think this is going to change
how you get information and access all your apps
on iPad. We also have a major update for another key part
of the iPadOS experience: multitasking. This year, we've made it
easier to discover, easier to use,
and even more powerful. To give you a closer look,
here's Shubham. [Shubham] Thanks, Craig. In iPadOS 15,
there's a new control that appears
at the top of your apps. Tapping on it reveals
the multitasking menu. From here, I can take an app,
full-screen, or work with two apps
at the same time by creating a Split View
or Slide Over. I'll tap on the Split View icon, and the app slides
to the edge of the screen, giving me quick access
to my home screen, where I can easily select
from any of my apps. I've been working on a podcast,
so I'll choose Ferrite. And now I can work
with Ferrite and Notes at the same time in Split View. It's also really easy
to switch apps in Split View. If I want to replace Ferrite,
I just swipe down, and Notes moves aside, letting me pick another app
from the home screen. Let's select Mail. This works exactly the same way to choose a new app
from either side of the screen. And we brought the same
ease of multitasking to apps with multiple windows. In Mail, I can touch and hold
on this message to open it
centered on my screen. This allows me to read
the entire email without leaving my current view. And I have the same
multitasking controls here, too, so I can easily move this
into Split View or Slide Over. But I want to save this email
and come back to it later. So I can just swipe down
to minimize it into a new area
we're calling the Shelf. The Shelf gives me easy access
to all open windows of an app. Let's go to Safari,
and you'll see that the Shelf appears automatically
when I switch apps. I often have a lot
of Safari windows open, many in Split View
paired with other apps, and now I can just tap
to quickly switch between them. I can also add or remove windows
right here from the Shelf. We've also made the App Switcher
even more powerful. I can now create a Split view just by dragging one app
over another. So that's multitasking
in iPadOS 15. Now back to you, Craig. [Craig] Thanks, Shubham. These new multitasking features will help our users
be more productive and do even more on their iPad, and what's really cool is we now have a new set
of keyboard shortcuts that let you do all of this
without lifting a finger. iPadOS 15 also gives you
more powerful ways to capture and organize
your information with Notes. This year we're adding
powerful new features for collaboration
and organization. First, we're adding mentions. Just mention someone
in a shared note and they'll get a notification
linking them back. There's also an all-new
Activity View that quickly shows you
what's changed in a shared note
while you were away. And to give users new ways
to organize their notes, we're adding tags. You can add a tag
anywhere in your note then use the new Tag Browser
to quickly find your notes. But sometimes you just want
to quickly jot down a note to remember
something important for later, and that's why
we're taking Notes system-wide with a feature
we call Quick Note. Quick Note is a fast and easy
way to get to a note, no matter what you're doing. Here's Will to show you
how it works. [Will] Thanks, Craig. Starting a Quick Note is easy. When I swipe,
the note appears out of the corner of the screen. Now that I've started a note, I can type or write
with Apple Pencil. It's perfect for jotting down
something like a phone number. And when I'm done,
I just swipe it away. Let's open Safari. What's super cool
about Quick Note is that it's aware
of the app I'm using. I'll start a new Quick Note
on top of Safari... ...and now I can easily add
a link from the website into my Quick Note. I can tap this link anytime
to return to this exact site. Let's go to a website
I added a link to earlier. A small thumbnail
pops up in the corner that allows me to quickly
get back to my Quick Note containing any useful
information I found. You'll notice there's text
highlighted on the page. And I added this text
to my Quick Note. And tapping on a link
from a highlight takes me right to
the content on the page. I can add a link
from almost any app I'm using, including third-party apps. Here's a link from Yelp,
and if I tap, it takes me right
to the restaurant listing. I can swipe
across my Quick Note to see my most recent ones. And anytime I want to see
all my Quick Notes, I can find them right
where you'd expect, in Notes.

advanced technologies to this iconic design the powerful new features in Mac OS Mojave come to life on the incredibly vivid and precise Retina display it contains over 4 million pixels which provide remarkable clarity high contrast and brilliant color the eighth generation dual-core processor is powerful and efficient while helping to achieve all-day battery life the Apple t2 security chip delivers advanced security and hay theory to MacBook Air along with the touch ID sensor it enables Apple pay and allows you to unlock your Mac with just the touch of a finger the latest generation Butterfly keyboard is backlit and provides more stability precision and responsiveness and the much larger force touch trackpad has built-in force sensors that allow you to click anywhere and experience a finer level of control - LED speakers deliver significantly more volume and bass for a fuller sound and wide dynamic range Thunderbolt 3 integrates USBC into the most powerful and versatile port ever and for the first time the unibody enclosure is made from 100% recycled aluminum to accomplish this we invented a new custom alloy it's designed to use fine shavings of recaptured aluminum that re-engineered down to the atomic level this new alloy is as beautiful and robust as any we've used before and it makes MacBook Air the greenest Mac ever with powerful new technologies and an all-new design and three beautiful finishes the new MacBook Air not only reimagines but our most loved map can be but also how it can be made [Music] you you [Music] foreign [Music] foreign

our channel and oilyt technology here and hit the bell notifications and for now check out our this video so more ar abilities were shown at wwdc 2021 with ios 15. so could we be finally seeing when the apple glasses release date and price will be well today i'm going to share what the apple specs will do how they will work and when we expect to get our hands on them so let's jump right in apple are creating some vr and ar devices the vr device at the moment is being referred to as apple vr but the other device is more to do with ar and at the moment is looking likely it's going to be called apple glasses today i'm going to be more focusing on the ar device known at the moment as apple glasses giving you such details such as the release date along with what we expect the apple glasses price to be and what the apple glasses features will also be anyway let's dive on in on what we know about the apple eyeglasses so apple glasses have been talked about a fair bit in the past and we have had leaks and rumors pop up even going back to 2015 and we've also had some come up in 2017 but it wasn't until around 2019 where apple were really pushing on ar in all their keynotes and demos and that's why apple is likely to bring out an ar eyewear project and as the rumor mill released more and more early information it looks like it's coming true very soon just take a look at the ipad pro and the iphone 12 announcements from last year for example both events talked about the new lidar sensor and you guessed it the sensor is mainly to help with ar so a dedicated ar device is definitely incoming so we just had wwdc 2021 but there was also a small slim chance that we could be seeing the apple glasses at this event but nothing was shown in the end however again ios 15 is showing more ar abilities like street view ar on your iphone as you walk around the city or even the new live text feature for example the ability to take a photo or even just do a live view on your camera and then just point it at some words and then basically you can copy and paste or even translate or even look up what the words mean and then there's even a new feature called visual lookup even this is machine learning and abilities we'd expect to see in the new apple glasses i think you're getting the point here even with apple's latest software features and the introduction of the lidar sensor for example as already mentioned in the ipad pro and the iphone 12 models apple are doing far more in ar space so apple glasses are close so how close you may ask well we had a leak from ming chi quo saying that the apple glasses are looking to be released in the second quarter of 2022 but before you get upset that 2022 is a long way away it is likely that apple will preview the device before that time for apple to announce the glasses and then release the product say three or even six months later it's not unheard of either we saw the mac pro the trash can shaped device announced in june 2013 and it actually came out five months later and then again the same with the newer mac pro that was announced in june 2019 and didn't actually come out right to the very end of 2019. other sources meanwhile have said that they're still coming out but they've been delayed by years with an ar headset apparently landing in either 2021 or 2022 followed by ar glasses in 2023. as you can see it's a bit of a mess right now and there's lots of confusion and debate around when or even if we'll get apple glasses but the latest leak suggests that they might be announced not too long from now but guessing our actual hands on them that's going to be a different story entirely so no it's not the news we wanted exactly here but let's take a look at the apple glasses leaks and rumors as well as apple's augmented reality background and why ar specs seem like the next big move for the tech giant one more thing i'd like to quickly talk about is the giveaway that we are doing on this channel right now and it is for this is for a brand new macbook pro m1 and that's right guys i'm going to be giving away this macbook pro m1 to one lucky subscriber when we get over 200 000 subscribers and all you need to do in the comments below is write what your favorite ios 15 feature is even if you even downloaded the beta let me know what feature you'd love to try out and then just put them in the comments below and then when we get over 200 000 subscribers i'm going to be revealing who the winner is of this macbook pro m1 but make sure you subscribe to the channel and hit that notification bell because when we get over 200 000 subscribers you all want to get that notification to find out if you're going to be the lucky winner of this brand new macbook pro m1 so let's get the next big item cross off the list and that is the apple glasses price so cesaro suggests that apple glasses will cost around 499 us dollars and that will be around 410 uk pounds and of course that is not including any prescription charges to alter the glass lenses if needed so let's talk more about what you've seen in patent and specs so our biggest leak is none other than our channel favorite john prosser john was the first to say that apple glasses will actually be called apple glass and will be capable of displaying information on both lenses with a user controlling via gestures both on and in front of the frames jonas also said that everything will be handled by a connected iphone and apple glass supposedly won't have conventional cameras but will have a lidar sensor to power the actual ar experiences other details include that there won't be a sunglasses version as the display won't work with tinted lenses also the outside observers looking at you directly face on won't be able to see anything on the lenses and also at the same time as well that the prototype at least will be made out of plastic however this could change for the real deal prasa also said that apple was experimenting with a special steve jobs edition version of the glasses that would act like an apple watch edition where the company sells a certain style of its product for a higher price from another source mark german at bloomberg has said that the previous information isn't correct though so take all of this with a big pinch of salt what john prosser has just proposed beyond that apple has been busy picking up companies with an interest in ar which suggests it's prepping its own product and recently tim cook said that apple had several new products in the pipeline that would just blow you away and i think one of them is apple glass we've also seen a bunch of apple patents appear recently explaining how specialist lenses could be used to cast images on a user's eye and how a iphone ipad could be used as a controller perhaps the biggest leak was in fact an injury report out of apple's cappuccino headquarters and it suggests that two employers had eye injuries due to working on a prototype unit apple has also made a number of key ar talent hires over the years according to aruma from bloomberg apple has persuaded a leading employee of nasa for the project in hiring jeff norris founder of mission operation innovation office at nasa's jet propulsion lab his team is apparently 1 000 people strong and the ar glasses they're working on are said to be a high quality resolution of cameras 3d scanning and an amazing display and advanced human detection also built straight into them they're also apparently working on an ar headset which could launch first with a design like the oculus quest but a lightweight more comfortable build instead in more recent news in may 2020 apple can firmly acquired nex vr a startup that produced virtual reality content from the likes of nba and fox sports while it's unclear how this could impact apple ar glasses it's logical the startup's expertise will contribute to the product design in some way so i've been banging on about apple glasses and that they will mainly use ar and some of you have probably heard of ar but not fully understood what it actually does and have i actually seen it before so to be honest you probably actually have seen it so some of the most popular examples of ar are lenses and filters available on instagram and snapchat the ones where for example you stick your tongue out and the dog's tongue appears over the top of it or your ears change into a dog's ears or your hearts coming out of your eyeballs or for example if you're doing a video chat and you can put on a silly hat on top of your head and it follows you around they are all ar experiences another great example before the days of covert 19 when we could go out and about was pokemon go where your pokeball and your pokemon could be seen for a combination of through your phone's camera and the phone's screen so with all these possibilities that have become reality in the last couple of years imagine now if you could slip on some glasses and when you run into say a train station and your glasses automatically tell you the train times to your destination right in front of you and it will show you arrows and guys on the floor to get you to the correct platform on time to catch your train or maybe you say to siri in the middle of a supermarket how do i make a great chicken curry and then at that moment on your screen straight away it will show you all the ingredients you need and it will guide you down all the correct aisles to the right location to pick up those ingredients so you can take them home and make yourself a great curry i could think of many more examples but i think you have the idea now now i will say this the idea of ar glasses have been invented before some years ago this was none other than google glass these advanced smart glasses were tipped to change everything tech to the way we live by overlaying layers of information onto the real world but thanks to people not really into this type of tech financial problems and design challenges they never really fully came out apart from a small number of developers and testers getting their hands on them although the trouble story of google glass may sound a bit of a failure it actually taught tech companies a great deal about building ar tech enabled eyewear and the challenges of bringing a whole new product category to the market it was very soon after that google pulled the plug on the google glass that apple invested into the ar and the ar kit they offer right now that's where we've got to today with ar so are you excited about the future of apple glasses or apple glass will it be a piece of tech you're investing and get let me know below if you plan to get it of course if we get any more news about the apple glasses we will

you’ll find that they come with Apple stickers. And this has caused people to wonder why.
Which is what I’ll explain right now. So Apple has one of the most loyal fan bases
in the world, and this has been the case even as far back as 1984 when the original Macintosh
was introduced. In fact, when Apple was on the brink of bankruptcy in the 90’s, devoted
Apple fans reportedly hung around the Mac section of computer stores and recommended
them to shoppers. This brand loyalty is fairly unique to Apple, since other tech companies
like Microsoft or Google don’t have such a dedicated following. Apple recognized this
was a competitive advantage and did everything they could to strengthen their fan base. And
Apple stickers were a result of that effort. Allowing their users to display their favorite
brand, similar to wearing a shirt featuring your favorite band. Although most people today buying iPhones
probably feel indifferent toward Apple, the company wasn’t always this popular. In fact,
Apple used to be the little guy. The only company with a chance to defeat IBM. Who was
trying to monopolize the entire computer market. So showing your support for Apple by displaying
their stickers, was a signal to others that you were rooting for the underdog.  But
as Apple grew, so did their marketing. They eventually went on to create popular products
like the iPod, and the MacBook became one of the most popular notebooks among students.
Apple weren’t really the underdogs anymore. So they became the cool kids instead. Just
consider the “Get A Mac” ad campaign from 2006. The two characters served as humanized
versions of a Mac and PC. One was hip, cool, and casual. While the other was a bit nerdy,
overdressed, and uptight. This was Apple telling customers that their computer determined their
identity. And if you wanted to be cool, you had to buy a Mac. Including Apple stickers
with those products further reinforced the notion of brand identity. Since they could
be displayed almost like a badge of honor that designated you part of the cool “Apple
club.” But whether you use the stickers out of love
for the brand, or because it’s cool, it all results one thing: free advertising for
Apple. In the early days, word of mouth was what caused the Apple I to be a big hit among
computer hobbyists. And it allowed hype to build around the Apple II and Macintosh. Apple
has always understood that organic word-of-mouth marketing is the most valuable form of advertising.
Hearing a family member rave about their MacBook Air leaves a much bigger impact than glancing
at the product in a TV ad. And seeing multiple people around you with Apple stickers provides
social proof that there must be something good about their products, if so many people
are proud to be users. So while you can always throw the stickers
away, many of us Apple fans like to keep them around as a reminder of the products we love. This is Greg with Apple Explained, thanks

Sorry Sorry another um surprising i guess apple related story these beats headphones that hit me out of left field today apparently we got them over here probably take a peek sometime soon they put out these 150 dollar studio buds these are the ones that lebron was wearing the other day and we were trying to figure out if they could have been an indication for like some next-gen airpods that actually hit beats first but it's my goodness it's actually the complete opposite direction and it's clear to me now how apple will continue the beats brand moving into the future as a budget offering as a more affordable product and a more android centric product how crazy is this you have no specialized apple chip inside of here and you have some enhancements to how it interacts with over bluetooth with android devices including quick pairing to your variety of google related products or google related software and they've done some software tricks to make it to make it pair on ios sort of like the airpods do but lacking the sophistication lacking the uh the the entire what was it what do they call it the w chip or the h1 h1 i think was it called w before that yeah yeah anyway so and then by and then price as well so 150 dollars is would make this the cheapest pair of airpods or is it the same price as the i can't even remember i feel like regular airpods are 159 but i have too many i have canadian prices and american prices in my head but that seems like a key i meant the apple airpods just regular airpods i think are 159 and then yeah they're 159 regular price though they do go on sale fairly frequently is that uh i think that's u.s oh that's you're definitely going to canada now i know yeah yeah regions trapped in the regions yeah 159 so this is so this product actually goes under the regular airpods which are not an in-ear design no interchangeable ear tips no colors to choose from but free engraving though super tight integration oh this is what i want to mention but the reason you want that integration if you're on ios you get all these fancy features switching between devices quickly switching between your laptop or that's not going to have any of that on the beats side so i think this is this is crazy to say but i think it's actually an android targeted headset or at least a universal targeted headset they're just like less expensive to compete with the likes of the expanding marketplace of just general wireless earbuds and the beats branding gives it a little a couple of extra style points i suppose for some users it has active noise canceling it has some water and sweat resistance of course the other universal choice is usbc for charging right yeah that's awesome no lightning or anything like that so a really interesting play for apple and uh and and the first actually in the shift because the previous beats product did have the apple specific chip and apple specific features so to me this is an indication that they're going to take the beats bread a different direction say if you're fully apple all the way get the apple products if you're anybody else in this vast ocean of wireless earbuds get the beets ones i don't know i'm just i mean there's some speculation in there june 24th is going to be available 149.99 i'm sure lebron is going to wear them for a while they'll promote them and get them in white red or black and they have no little stem on them they actually have like a pretty kind of nice minimal design so i'm curious to test the fit and see how it all feels [Music] hey it's me blippi and look at where i'm at i'm at a super center but look at what it is it's a delicious apple i wonder how this apple got here [Music] every apple at the grocery store came from an apple field first you gotta pick the perfect fruit like this one this one looks really tasty and after you pick it you put it inside the bin with all the other apples [Music] let's try and find an apple together hmm do you see an apple oh i see one yeah look [Music] it all starts by a worker hand picking every single apple and then they dump their sack into the bins and when the bin gets full a tractor picks it up and takes it away now that the apples are all out of the fields and into the bins and the bins are full now we need to transport them to the trucks wow four giant bins full of apples and one red tractor [Music] okay the apples are now here at the semi truck [Music] now we gotta load up all the bins on top of the back of the semi-truck with a forklift [Music] the bins are loaded on the back of the truck so let's go [Music] off to the factory we go [Music] we've arrived at the factory so now we need to take a forklift and get every single bin off the back of the semi truck [Music] okay now it is time to clean and package all of the apples [Music] green apples now we need to empty the bins of all of the apples so we can clean them and package them [Music] the apples start their floating journey while the bins get emptied out look the bins are empty whoa that's a lot of floating apples then they get taken out of the water and scrubby dub dub nice and clean and clean some more look at all those [Music] bristles [Music] wee those apples look like they're having fun and then all the apples get sprayed with some water nice and clean and then they go through giant fans [Music] once the apples are all dry they get sorted they get sorted by the ones that look really tasty to eat and ones that don't look tasty to eat [Music] and remember the not so tasty looking apples yeah these are them they get to go up some fun apple escalators and then they get to go down some radical apple conveyor belts on their journey to make some tasty apple pie but we're not done there yet every tasty looking apple gets a sticker this is the sticker machine [Music] and once every single apple has its very own sticker they get put on what i like to call apple beds and then the next step is that those apple beds get put inside of cardboard boxes and some get put inside plastic [Music] [Music] bags oh looks like some of these boxes need their tops closed [Music] now that the apples are clean and packaged up we got a storm in a giant refrigerator and wait for the trucks [Music] we're inside the giant refrigerator now it is very cold in here this is where all of the apples get stored wow look at how many apples there are that's a really tall storage building [Music] yippee the semi truck is backing up to the building so it can be loaded up with a bunch of fresh apples the apples are almost ready for you to eat we're currently loading them into the back of our truck all right forklifts just a little bit more apples [Music] now that the semi-truck is all full of apples it's gonna

and seeds with you at tanaka farms in irvine california well this is the end of this video but if you want to watch more of my videos all you have to do is search for my name will you spell my name with me ready b-l-i-p-p-i flippy good job all right see you later bye so much hey today i am at a giant ranch with my good friends axe family howdy everyone this is gonna be so much fun because we're gonna check out some horses cows and other fun ranching stuff hey blippi why don't you go to get a saddle and we'll saddle up this is gonna be fun whoa look at where we are we are inside a real cow barn axe family's gonna bring in the horse and in the meantime i'll show you around look this is where cow dogs stay [Music] that's so fun oh and here's another one ah come on and another one look come here must be out working because the door's open the cowboys must have got him but look hello no one's in there [Music] whoa look at this hey no really hey this is hay and it's so tasty looking just kidding tasty to cows and horses not to humans whoa [Music] oh do you see that look take a really close look whoa yummy [Music] so [Music] whoa come on [Music] and look a squeeze shoot and a head catch this is where the livestock go right over here to go to the doctor and get all their vaccinations [Music] whoa it's like a wheelbarrow but it's really flat this is what you put the hay on wheel it out there and then go feed it to the cows [Music] i just got really dizzy okay one last place come in here this is the tack room look whoa all these saddles okay in order to ride a horse i need your help let's pick our favorite saddle okay come on [Music] this one nah this one nah yeah this one looks like a great one okay but first we need a horse pad these up top oh come here look at this one do you know what color this is yeah one of my favorite too blue okay let's grab this horse pad and we'll grab this one right here and then we also need a bridle come on okay got the bridle let's put it on the saddle okay here we go yeah [Music] okay hey thanks blippi for grabbing the tap yeah why don't you hand me the saddle pad all right we'll put those on first saddle pads what do those do saddle pads go on underneath your saddle to put some cushion for the horse the saddle is what the cowboy sits in okay and so this goes on the horse after the pads and it'll strap onto the horse so that the rider will have a place to sit the bridle or the head stall okay and a cowboy or cowgirl uses a bridle to steer the horse like a steering wheel so like this and then over its ears like this and you control the bridle with what we call reins oh so these are the steering wheel to the horse okay well does that mean that i'm ready to steer the horse i think so buppy [Music] all right blippi your turn all right whoa okay here i go that's a good ride thanks here i go whoa [Music] this horse is dark brown she is so beautiful [Music] this horse's name is fancy and she is so fancy that was so much fun not only is fancy a beautiful animal but we use her and the other horses as workhorses to move cattle around the ranch [Music] that was sure a blast riding a horse let's go see what else there is on this great ranch [Music] here we go here we go oh four-wheelers are called four-wheelers because they have four wheels one two three four whoa whoa you're riding the four-wheeler with me isn't this fun whoa on the ranch there's so many great useful machines like this four-wheeler and like this this giant dump truck and this medium-sized backhoe and now for their biggest machine at the ranch now that's a big machine now that the skidgeon is parked and it's safe to get up really close my good friend cody from axe family hey everybody he'll show you around are you ready yeah let's go okay so this skidgen is actually used for fighting wildfires it's it's like a fire truck and a monster truck combined you see these big tires this is just like a monster truck tire look how huge it is these are so the skidgeon doesn't get stuck when it's out in the wilderness let's go up here to the front up here we have the plow and we have the brush guard and this goes down to the ground and it pushes and it clears all the brush and it makes a fire line so that when the fire comes to the fire line it'll stop come on here to the back in the back we have a giant water tank right here this is full of water it's about 1100 gallons of water and there's a hose reel right here this red hose you can pull it out and run it out to a fire and put it down there's also a turret up on the top that spins around and sprays water but before i show you that let's go on inside the cab all right so now we're on the inside of the skidgeon let me show you around this is the steering wheel and this is basically what's used to drive the skidgen around and if you look right up here this is the dash where all the gauges are and if you press on this button right here that's the horn you see that now look down here by my feet this is the brake pedal and this is the gas pedal and then right here there's this little lever this controls the blade up at the front of the skidgen let me show you the coolest part this is the joystick that controls the water cannon watch i'm gonna spray some water so [Music] that was so much fun filming at this giant much to learn ranch it'll make you want to all right if the apple watch is the hottest news trust me there's a reason why as yes it looks like we're finally getting some big changes with the apple watch this year but it seems some rumored features actually won't make it samsung might be differentiating the galaxy s22 ultra from the other models and let's just say it doesn't really sound good and apple just released the beats studio buds which are well more interesting for android users than apple users i'm jaime rivera and who would have thought that apple would ever admit that android users deserve some extra love this is parker now daily of course the official news today begin with deals which you are free to skip in the time codes below let's start particularly with amazon and apple which don't seem to stop and we're not complaining starting with the brand new m1 imac which is 50 off if you go for the base model in either silver or blue the rest of the color variants are still 12.99 if you're looking for a laptop the m1 macbook pro that i'm using is 150 off leaving the base model for 14.49 and then the higher tier is also getting pretty much the same discount the latest ipad air is still 89 off leaving that 256x of storage variant for 660 and then the regular ipad is also getting a 30 discount leaving that at 2.99 now moving on from apple amazon is selling a bundle of two new echos for 120 bucks but you have to be a prime member and use the code and the screen for checkout you can also get two echo dots for 45 bucks by using the code on the screen again but you have to be again a prime member now finally if you want to save both time and money we have a special promotion on nordpass premium where you can get a 70 discount for one of the best password managers in the market we have more deals on other amazon echo speakers google nest speakers razer and logitech peripherals and more in the description now let's keep talking official news but moving on to apple and beats over the past months there's been a ton of teasers and leaks and then there was lebron showing off a pair of unreleased buds and who can argue with lebron well the company just made them official but let's just say that they're not what you think these are the new beats studio buds and think of them as a pair of neutered earpods pretty much and listen we call them airpods because they're made by apple and neutered because they have zero apple dna there is no h1 chip no w1 chip which means no proximity no auto switching between your apple devices now the reason why they're special is because they're a pair of earbuds made by apple that offer active noise cancellation transparency modes one touch pairing and all that for 150 bucks right this sort of makes even the first pair of airpods look bad but again just a bit they also bring siri support and a bit of the find my and offer up to 8 hours of listening time with the battery case bringing an extra 24 hours and that said those numbers are with anc off you'll get around 15 hours total if you have it on now even more interesting if you stick to apple music you will get spatial audio and dolby atmos so that's also great now the reason why these seem like sort of airpods for android is because well they charge through usb-c you can control anc and transparency on the beats android app and you can set your own digital assistant if you're using an android phone so yeah apple just made a cheaper pair of airpods pro that actually work well with android for less money that is kind of weird but also kind of an indication that apple has realized that their music strategy can't be a walled garden i even wonder if that's gonna be the strategy for beats going forward which wouldn't make a ton of sense if you think of it let's move on to samsung for the next couple of segments starting with things we're expecting this year with the s21 fe but we actually don't have good news before today there were a ton of leaks and reports claiming that we should expect this new s21 fe in august but uh you might have to wait a little longer that's the bad news according to a tipster called chun the galaxy s21 fe has been suspended for at least a month due to the global ship shortage so we shouldn't expect it to be released before september now he claims that if the situation gets worse the device might end up being cancelled completely now he also mentions that the battery could also be part of the problem but they don't really specify what this problem is now ice universe also claims that the battery might be the real cost for the sudden shutdown and not due to the chip so that's another twist in the same problem now the s21 fe has been tipped to bring a 6.5 inch amoled display snapdragon 88 8 gigs of ram 256 gigs of storage along with a probable 5 000 milliamp hour battery if that ends up happening we'll see how the rumors evolve over time but for now it seems that their unpacked event might be focused on foldables and wearables or i don't know probably we get the device announced but the launch dates happen later let's stick to samsung and the galaxy s series but let's just say that the bad news don't stop with the previous segment seems that the galaxy s22 rumors continue and they're not necessarily good so far we've heard that there are three variants with the ultra getting all the major camera improvements but now it seems that that's not the only thing it's getting a new report from sam mobile cites tipster tron who claims that samsung is considering having the s22 ultra be the only model with premium materials like a glass back the base and the plus models will have an improved reinforced polycarbonate plastic it's plastic now tron does specify that samsung is simply considering this and it's not really set in stone though it doesn't stop there another report suggests that the ultra would also be the only device with an ltpo panel and retain the 6.8 inch diagonal display with the other models being slightly smaller and not with the same technology now the question is if this polycarbonate would help drive the price down as i'm one of the people that actually doesn't mind the switch of the prices right i'd even say that glastic is more durable but you tell me how much you'd be willing to pay for that we'll have a poll in the community tab and let us know in the comments what would you think about a galaxy s22 flagship with a polycarbonate back or should i say two and finally for the hottest news today let's talk about cupertino and the apple watch because it seems some of the changes might be good enough to warrant the title of this being hot as we get close to september we've heard a few rumors on the apple watch series 7. 7 but we now get a report from bloomberg with a ton of details and i'm actually going to trust them according to mark german apple plans to refresh the apple watch this year by adding a faster processor improved wireless connectivity and an updated screen where things start getting cool is that apparently we can expect ultra wideband functionality which will allow for the find my features that you get with air tags along with being better for devices like digital car keys or house keys or whatever now as for the design sadly it won't become round but when it comes to the display cupertino has been testing thinner display borders as well as a new lamination technique that gets the display closer to the front cover interesting though is the fact that it might make the watch a bit thicker but german claims that it's not really noticeable not everything is fun in games though previous reports mentioned that we should be getting new biometric sensors like body temperature sensors blood sugar sensors but apparently neither of those would be ready this year now on a previous report mark german also claimed that cupertino is working on a rugged sports variant but even that will have to wait until 2022 at the earliest as a response an interesting twist is that it seems that the apple watch se will get a visual refresh to be more like a companion to the series 7 with less features so yeah ultra wideband features a display with new technology smaller bezels and a faster processor the question is would that make you want to upgrade or even buy one cause in my case i'm not sure if you've noticed but i've been back to using my garmin and it's because the fitness features and the insights provided by this company are far superior so i doubt that i would want to switch back to the apple watch even with the features that we got on the new watch os that was just announced but that's just me leave us a comment down below we'd love to know your opinion friends again if you want to get the news earlier follow us on parkingout.com and subscribe to our channel for more videos like this one you also follow us on social medias our extended coverage happens on instagram and follow me on my personal handles to see me be shocked at certain moves from cupertino please give this video a thumbs up if you liked what you saw i'm hameem rivera thanks so much for watching we'll see you tomorrow hey folks i'm mark ryan this is super review and this over here is apple music so if you were paying attention last week you probably noticed that apple recently updated apple music with lossless streaming support and i gotta say probably the most common question i'm getting is is it worth it is it is lossless streaming a sound difference that people can actually appreciate and recognize so i'll be perfectly honest folks likes folks like me audiophiles we're pretty excited about loss of streaming on apple music but i think it's worth stopping to ask should we be you know i listen to all my music here let me show you here this is the lossless streaming music player that i typically use for listening to my music library which i keep in lossless not on a streaming device or not in a streaming service i keep it locally in flack and maybe it's irrational but i kind of feel like i gotta keep it lossless and so for that reason i'm pretty interested in the fact that apple music now supports lossless but if i'm being perfectly honest with myself i'm not totally sure that i can actually hear the difference so that's kind of what i wanted to do today was actually test myself to see can i hear the difference between apple music lossless versus apple music not lossless and i'll just say up front my kind of expectations are that i might be able to pick out some differences but they also might just be a little bit of placebo but i'll show you what the test is that we're gonna do today anyway so i've got two different apple devices on hand both updated to the latest ios 14.6 and they both have apple music on them i'm going to run them both into apple dongles these are the lightning to 3.5 millimeter adapters for headphones and this is actually how you get really good sound like if you're curious about if you're new to audiophilia and you're curious about how to get really good sound out of an iphone this little dongle nine bucks that's enough so i've got those running into this switcher which this is not a hi-fi switcher but it's sufficient here and i did do some measuring some uh some some sort of like uh microphone testing just to make sure that the output on these things is actually volume match because that's really important when you do the sort of a b testing that i'm about to do and that's what this little switcher lets me do it's going to let me run two different outputs or two different inputs into the switcher and then if i hit this button it'll toggle between my ipad and my iphone and i've got the ipad set to let's see i'll show you where i've got it here um we will actually we should probably zoom in on that so i can show you for real but here in the ipad we've got lossless streaming enabled and wi-fi streaming and downloads i both have set to high resolution lossless which means when i'm listening to music on this ipad i will get apple's best quality possible here on the iphone however i've done kind of the opposite i've got it set to let's see audio quality i can go ahead and just turn lossless off and now i'm just going to get standard high quality streaming which is not quite lossless but it's still kind of like a high bitrate aac trans code apple's typical stuff and i'm really curious to see can i hear the difference between the ipad and the iphone so everything here is basically identical except for which streaming technology is being used but that's not the only component here of course i'm not going to be using air pods or any of apple's headphones for doing this test for a couple of reasons one they're just not my favorite headphones but also if you're new to this idea of lossless you should just know up front that loss of streaming can't be done over bluetooth there's no bluetooth out there right now that has enough bandwidth to support true lossless streaming so what i'm going to do instead is i'm going to listen on my favorite earphones which are these these are the moondrop s8s and i will try and throw them over here into view so you can take a look for those who are not familiar with this earphone this is actually a 700 earphone not that i'm trying to flex or anything like this but this is just the earphone that i listen to the most i'm very familiar with this so if there are differences to be picked out between these two i think i'll probably hear it on this earphone but that's not the only thing i've got here i've also got with me a set of three thousand dollar 64 audio earphones these are not mine these are to me on loan by headphones.com and you know i'm doing this test of you know maximum resolution testing and i suppose i might as well have a 3 000 earphone on hand just to see if there is a difference to be picked up i want to make sure that the earphones that i'm using are not an excuse for me not being able to hear so i'm going to warn you ahead of time this video might be kind of boring because we're just going to be sitting here watching me listen to these i have not done this listening test before in fact i have purposely not listened to lossless versus non-lossless on apple before this test because i want to make sure that this this result is kind of live and we've done this sort of live debunking attempt in the past and i thought it brought some pretty interesting results so i wanted to try and do it here and bring that to the apple music conversation that said all right i'm not going to be able to stream the music you're not going to be able to listen along with me because youtube will copyright strike me and i'll get banned hammered et cetera et cetera but i do have links in the description of this video to playlists with all of the music that i'm going to be listening to in this test and these this this playlist here that's what i've got loaded up on both of these i've got links to a an apple music version of the playlist as well as a spotify version if you just want to listen along spotify doesn't have lossless streaming yet but eventually you'll get it but those things will i think will be pretty good reference for you to kind of follow along and i'll try to in real time talk about what i'm listening for what i'm hearing or if i'm hearing anything at all so again this video you know i'm really conscious about i don't want to mislead anybody or make anyone think that lossless lossless streaming is going to be the change for them that like hd video was when we came from standard definition my honest expectation is in this test either i'm not going to be able to hear a difference or i will be able to hear a difference but it will be pretty negligible that's my expectation but obviously i'm just going to tell you exactly what i hear and if that ruins my audio file cred i'm totally fine with that just here to be honest with you and and but really if you want to make the biggest difference in your sound experience your personal sound experience i totally recommend getting into different headphones and different earphones like something like the moondrop s8 so like all my other videos this is a live stream if you're watching now live how's it going uh there's a chat box somewhere i guess it's to your right anyway there's a chat box if you have any questions for me you want to have any comments drop them in the chat and i'll try and pay attention to it a little bit in real time because this will be a slower paced video than my typical reviews if you're new here and you haven't already subscribe to the channel ding the youtube bell and then youtube will let you know next time i'm live because i do all my videos live if you want to have a conversation with me this is a pretty good chance to do that you could also join the discord server which i have linked to in the description down below i'm there chatting all the time and maybe not listening in real time this is a pretty unique experience but if you want to chat there's a good place and i guess that will do it for kind of the intro and exposition let's just go ahead and get into the testing and i will quickly show off look at this i've got picture in picture technology now you didn't think we had that but so again here's the setup here's the rig what i'm going to do what i'm planning to do is listening to the listening to these songs i'll basically start them at the exact same time and listen for a while and i can use again i can use this button here to switch between the two different devices and i guess you probably can't really tell which button or which is which so i guess you're gonna have to take my word for it but i'm gonna try and and again i'm not trying to mislead anybody i want this to be as honest and transparent as a an exposition as possible so i'm just going to be straight up with you and tell you if i got something right when i tried to guess um or if i just kind of blew it because frankly that's kind of my expectation for this test all right so i'm gonna pull out my moon drop s8s which i mentioned these are my these are my my favorite earphones that i've got um definitely the ones i'm the most familiar with and i think that will be a good test and i will plug them in down here into the bottom of the switcher and if i set these volume [Music] levels to exactly the same basically the same number of clicks let's start with one two three four five i don't know if this is actually a good volume level but one two three four five these are both at the same volume level when i start playing them i should be hearing them both at the same volume and i'm gonna go through these songs probably not like in alphabetical order or anything like that like the order is just kind of arbitrary well the order here is alphabetical but that's not necessarily how i want to listen to them but each of these tracks do kind of different things for me and i think the track that i want to start with is this song called break for lovers which is just a song i'm really familiar with by men i trust and this song it's just got a lot of really good vocal texture in it and i feel like and it's also got some higher some high frequency sounds so i think that this is a song that it might have some qualities that would stand out for me if there were differences for me to hear so let's go ahead and dive into the first track which again if you're following along we'll be break for lovers by men i trust let's plug in and attempt to play at the same time okay and i'll tell you right now volume level five it's too low so i'm going to bump it up to 10. wait let's see five six seven eight eight's pretty good five six seven eight i'll jump over here volume levels are matched well okay i'm listening to the ipad at the moment do what's up dmtr placebo i gotta be honest at this point like nothing's standing out at all i'm gonna increase the volume to volume levels i don't usually listen to or i don't usually listen at because sometimes when it's higher volume you can notice things that you might not notice otherwise so let's go 9 10. this is much louder than i normally listen paul i see you asking how it sounds they both sound excellent this song's awesome these earphones are awesome i just screwed it up um what i wanted to do real quickly is set this up so to make sure that i'm listening to these songs a loop rather than advancing to the next one um how do i do this in apple music sorry i'm actually an apple music noob if you haven't noticed um how do i set this thing this interface i don't know i don't know about it but if i do that that should loop single song okay so just initial initial thoughts here is i'm not hearing an obvious difference although i started to think at the end of that song there's like this kind of high frequency ch ch sound in there and i didn't notice it at lower volumes but at higher volumes i felt like i started to hear a difference between them and the song was about to end so then i screwed it up and let me start the song over again and see if that was a real difference or just something that yeah it's like a ghost difference these are the kinds of if you're not i don't know we'll have this cut we'll have this conversation some other time let me let me plug in and go back to here foreign so it's actually not so much the the ch sound but in kind of even behind that sound there's a a more defined clicking like with less of a little bit more defined at the sound and i feel like there is a slight difference there okay so again this could be totally a high-res placebo but i feel like i'm hearing a very slight difference um again in that that specific sound effect and then maybe even just in like a blackness of background that part i'm almost certain is placebo but here's a way i can kind of test myself is basically i can um randomly hammer this button down here to just kind of rent just land on one of these randomly and i i won't necessarily i won't know which one i'm on and then i can listen to it and guess and then i'll feel the button to see if it's pressed down or pressed up and that will confirm whether or not my guess is right i give myself about a 50 chance of getting this crap which if you're into statistics means that's just actually the same as a random chance i think i'm on the ipad and i am okay try it again i think i'm on the iphone and i'm on the ipad so there you go 50 50 chance i got it right once i got it wrong once pretty good indicator that it's a bit of placebo let's try a different song at this point i don't think break for lovers is going to show me the difference between these and there again there might still be a little bit of something there if i'm listening really closely but it's tough um but let's try something with i think dreams by fleetwood mac is a pretty good test um if you've listened to this track before and i'll be honest i'm actually not too familiar with the 2001 remaster which is the version that's on apple music but i think it'll be a good test anyway because it's got a lot of just acoustic style instruments in them a lot of guitar strums and then a lot of there's like high hats in the music but then there's also drum brushes and um and snares which i feel like that gives you this kind of high frequency sound that based on what i understand about high resolution audio that's where you would kind of expect the differences so let me try let me try that actually i just noticed too that this is not looping all right let's let's go with dreams we're going to sync up playback of dreams by fleetwood mac gotta be honest if there's a difference here it's it's definitely not obvious let me see what's going on in chat while i listen to this i saw some disagreement about whether or not this is a valid test to begin with was it um alan talking about bit perfect through a dac and like you need a you need a you need the right deck and like saying that the uh the apple dongle will kind of necessarily uh up sample everything to 48 kilohertz so now that may or may not be true i don't i don't know too much about the specifics of the electronics going on in the apple dongle um that said like if everything is being up sampled to 48 khz like that doesn't mean that they're the differences between a lossless file starting from a losses file and an mp3 or an aac in this case wouldn't have benefits through that conversion because you know maybe that conversion is not going to be a lossy conversion it's going to be an upscaled conversion it's not going to introduce more information than was there to begin with but it's also not going to reduce information so if you're starting from higher quality file and up sampling it to let's say 48khz if that's what's going on um the losses file theoretically should still sound better i know a lot of people get really hung up on whether or not something is bit perfect and i gotta be honest like again maybe this is this is my bias this is why i've got the high-res placebo t-shirt as i put a lot of time into listening for these differences before not just inside of apple music but in you know mp3 players and android players and stuff like that and it just feels to me like a lot of effort spent on something that i am not confident i can pick out in a b testing and that's kind of what i wanted to show here like i'm not trying to debunk lossless audio that's the easiest thing in the world by the way for me to debunk this because i can just say even if i heard a difference i could pretend like i didn't hear a difference but again that's not what i want to do here i don't want to mislead anyone and i don't want to i don't know i'm not trying to make a strong point here i'm really just kind of trying to explore this thing and alan i appreciate the comments about 44 kilohertz up sampling and bit perfect and stuff like that but i don't know i don't i don't i don't think it makes it i honestly don't think it makes any difference and i don't think that it invalidates this test all right songs restarting still listening to dreams i'm really struggling i'm not i'm not hearing a difference here if i'm perfectly honest with you all um i'll try another song of course but yeah i'm really struggling to hear any difference at all and this is a song that i feel like should be a pretty good test um it feels like it should be a pretty good test because it's got analog instruments it's got guitar strumming with a lot of nuance in the transients it's got that you know it's got the the very obviously positioned um hi-hat sound over here in my right ear and like i can hear the decay of it and it just it it sounds it sounds identical as i'm toggling between these two again listening through a source that is ostensibly identical into a pretty high resolution earphone at volume levels louder than i even normally listen to so that's where we're at right now let me go ahead and switch songs though um let's see what would be another good one for me to test i think let's go and go with suffer by the smashing pumpkins um this is a track that has um it it's got like this really nice depth to it this is a song that i like listening to for listening to the transients on guitar strings and stuff like that you can start to hear like the the plucks and the fingers kind of running against the guitars it's got a really nice depth from the kick drums um so i'll go with that and we'll see if there's a difference to be heard you know let's time this as best as possible i will say i'm impressed with apple music's ability to um load these files basically instantaneously there's another test out there on the internet by npr um you can check it i've probably linked to it before and i'm going to give away a spoiler a a cheat for how to win that test 100 of the time the uncompressed wave vials take longer to start playing so when you're a b testing them and you play one you click play on one and it starts immediately that's probably a low-res mp3 if you click play and and it starts maybe like a second later it's probably because it's a larger file size which means it's the uncompressed file that basically breaks that test i just ruined it for everybody but it's nice here with apple music i'm playing them both at the same time and it seems like they're pretty they're pretty synchronized transient snails saying clearly the essay is too low as well that's why we've got we've got the three thousand dollar uh 64 audio u18s which i'll test on in just a bit but i don't think it's the s8 urbidi is saying that's why audiophiles don't use apple products that's not at all the lesson that you should be taking away from this test in my opinion and not because i'm like a big apple fan and i'm i don't listen to music on apple i just have zero doubt that apple is not the limiting factor here paul i see you're saying that you've been watching some other tests some youtubers notice a difference with sennheiser headphones and a decent dac so i've got a set of sennheiser hd600s over here which i could test on but um i don't think the apple dongles here are going to really push the hd 600s to the volume levels that i'm listening to right now which again are louder than i normally listen to but i don't think the apple dongle will do that for me and because i don't have too i don't have like cop two copies of the same dac except for the apple dongle i don't think that will be a valid test now i'll also say that i would not be surprised if those same those same people that are listening and saying that they can hear a difference if you put them in a real strong a b test experience like a blind a b test i would not be surprised if they didn't pass that so like there's this low-key symbol just kind of going on in the background of this and i feel like on the decay of that there is there's variability because it's an analog instrument and the the drummer is you know not hitting at the exact same time this exact same way every time so when i'm switching back and forth between these two devices sometimes i do hear something that sounds a little bit different but then when i go back it's hard for me to verify if that's a real difference or if that's just because it's you know strike number 30 rather than strike number 28 and strike number 28 just happened to be a little bit softer or something like that this is the kind of thing where like if i was really super serious about this test i would and i do have these files i have like clip outs of like 30 second chunks of songs that i listen to on repeat that's a pretty good way to really narrow down is it like this specific sound or is it just that there's differences as the sound is played multiple times throughout a song if that makes sense um i'll just say straight up here in this test like again i'm hearing some differences but it's not big enough that i'm confident that it's down to the compression technology and it's not just the fact that they're different right it's it's drum strike number 33 instead of 27. alston macau saying this setup is not very good please let me know what you think would make this setup better in a significant manner because i know if i had like a better um i actually not too worried about the apple dolls i think these are pretty good source kind of been measured as objectively as most people could reasonably want as a very nice neutral clean source um this device right here definitely not a high resolution device but it's just passing in an analog signal i did measure i did measure the impedance that this thing adds right because all cables will have a little bit of impedance and this thing this thing seems to add about 0.1 to 0.2 ohms of impedance which is not a lot but it could be potentially enough to change the sound of let's say a balanced armature earphone but if it's doing that it's going to do the same thing it's going to do it evenly for both of these both of these sources right it's not treating one source differently than the other alston saying dongle dac don't really cut it you might be surprised or i would before being really confident in that claim uh i would do some research and honestly like test yourself i see some questions about whether or not i'm actually getting lossless and if you want to see i can confirm by pulling this up and here you'll see let's zoom in on that we got lossless label showing up here under the song and if i go over here on the iphone uh where do i see it here it's not quite there god i really just don't understand this interface very well it would appear there and there's no lossless label here but there is the lossless label down here so pretty confident that we're getting the right mix of files grant you're saying if you touch the lossless logo it tells the sample rate and bitrate so for those that are curious i will tap the lossless logo hopefully i don't change my position in the song there you go this is a 24 bit 44.1 kilohertz a lac so 24 bit that would make this a high resolution file technically somehow i knocked him out of sync but um yeah again like i don't think i hear a difference here on suffer um let's go ahead and go to the next track which will be um let's let's try so i've been mostly listening for high frequency differences because that's honestly where i expect if there is a difference to be heard it would be in the high frequency uh but let's go ahead and try something with a little bit more bass and that will be this song by fkj called blessed we'll try that out and uh see if there's a difference but again up to this point i gotta be honest like i'm trying really hard to back up my audio file cred i suppose but i'm just i gotta be honest there's there's no difference for me to hear but let's uh let's jump into blessed and i'll pull this up just so you can see we got lossless over here and no losses over here i think it's funny that a lot of people i mean i appreciate y'all watching but it seems like a lot of people are kind of in disbelief or imagine that the equipment that i'm using here is somehow insufficient for displaying the differences between them let's say maybe that is the case like to what extent does a person have to go to make out a difference between lossless and not lossless streaming is it realistic to expect that that is an extent that many people go to and is it realistic to expect that this is sort of a listening mode that most people will want to enter uh i guess what i'm trying to say is if you're just looking for a really good sounding music and you're not interested in like buying five thousand dollars worth of equipment and and a b testing and sitting here the way that i'm doing like this is not me necessarily enjoying music this is me kind of trying to dissect music and and try to listen for things and make sure i'm not tricking myself if you're not interested in that particular mode of listening i gotta say straight up lossless music doesn't matter and that's that's coming from a guy who has all of my music on in in a lossless because why not like i might as well and i'll be perfectly honest like i am definitely um more attracted to apple music because it supports lossless but again it's it's it's not a rational thing i think precog vision another i am reviewer he actually put it a really good way um he says that he uses lossless lossless music for his file storage because of fomo fear of missing out which i think is actually a really good way of putting um kind of the rash or describing the rationale that someone at least like me who i'm not at all confident i can hear a difference sometimes i think maybe there's a little bit of difference there but then when i go and a b it i'm like ah maybe not but i still choose lossless because of fomo because i just want to make sure and lossless is really nice because you don't ever have to worry about like is there a compression artifact in the music is that what's causing this glare on a cymbal strike or is that what's causing a low resolution no it's just the original recording was not that great and that's honestly true of most recordings so i'm still very interested personally in having lossless music and again i am honestly attracted to apple music because it's lossless but it's really not because i think it sounds better it's just fomo and uh i don't know again like i understand that this position that i'm taking right now is the easy one to prove right because even if i heard a difference i could lie to you and say that i don't hear a difference but i don't know why i would do that it would be harder for me to say i do hear a difference and lie about that because i can kind of show you with again not the best abx or not the best blind a b testing but i can kind of blind a b test myself here and i could show you that i actually heard the difference and and kind of prove it in a tangible way but i'm really just not hearing anything that i'm confident in uh let's go ahead and i mean that's i'm gonna keep listening for a little bit and i'm gonna keep going diving into some other songs and i am gonna pull out the three thousand dollar sixty-four audio items just in case um but if you're waiting for a conclusion i think that just about does it that's about the best that i can say if you are a casual music listener should you be excited about lossless streaming on apple music my opinion i don't think so is it a good reason to switch to apple music not necessarily but it actually is still pretty compelling to me again because of that fomo thing just do not go into this expecting the difference from going you know from 1080p to 4k right 1080p to 4k you got a nice display you can totally tell the difference of it maybe you have to be pretty close to your television but you can totally tell that difference that is an obvious difference to tell going from lossless to not losses to lossy compression this is not an obvious difference this is a difference that with the right equipment maybe you can pick out but maybe you're also just fooling yourself so yeah let me go ahead and swap over to the 64 audios again i don't i don't want any excuses here i don't want anyone telling me i've got the wrong equipment i've got the wrong deck i'm not using the right usb adapter i honestly think that if that's your explanation for what's going on here i don't think i don't think that those assertions would stand up under blind a b testing that's my honest opinion maybe you've got golden ears and you can hear way better than i can right i'm a 38 year old guy my hearing is pretty good like i do a pretty decent job like i can hear up to i've tested about 18 000 hertz not the loudest at 18 000 hertz but i could still detect up to about 18 000 hertz so like my hearing's not shot um but i know that there are definitely people out there that have better hearing than me and maybe you're one of those people but if you're gonna if you're gonna assert that this is a difference that is obvious that anyone can hear i really highly strongly doubt that that's my honest opinion but what's going with the 64 ideas and again this is a volume level louder than i normally listen i need to go to a different song um let me try this track by eddie palmieri um this is a song i like to use for testing soundstage because it's just got this really nice big and deep sound it's got a lot of high frequency stuff kind of going all over the place so it can be a little bit difficult to focus on particular sounds but maybe if there's like a difference in dynamic range or something like that this might be a good track for showing that off so go ahead and start these two and again pull these things up so that we can see that we're streaming in lossless case you were dubious there and uh well there we go they're not synced somehow so let me restart them better miranda see you accusing me of using a lossy iem cable that might be true actually that might be the one the one weakness in this audio chain it's the i am cable the song's rad by the way i hope you're listening along so i don't know i think i might be about ready to tap out on this test um this track right here is really good because it's got again a lot of um it's a very busy song and it presents a very nice sound stage but there's also like this really good sense of depth that uh i don't know i don't i don't know enough about audio production but i feel like if there was an obvious difference in dynamic range um that would kind of have the effect of compressing that sense of depth and i'm switching back and forth between these two like i again it's it's there's a thing in my head where i switch over to the ipad that has the loss of streaming and in my mind i'm like thinking to myself oh maybe there's a slight slight difference there but then when i kind of like blind flick the switch a bunch of times and try to guess which one i'm on like i'm just i'm not anywhere better than like 50 chance which means it's completely random so that's honestly i think where i'm gonna land on this test i mean i'll keep listening i'll keep hanging out with y'all if you have a conversation i think that will be maybe the next best thing that we can do is take some feedback from the chat what are what's what's on your mind what are the things that you know i've seen some people disagreeing with this methodology some other people say no it's actually pretty fine i would love to get to the bottom of this as best as possible again my point my point here is not actually to make a point i'm not trying to i did not come into this test i definitely came to the test with pretty uh pre-existing expectations and i and i was upfront with those but i wasn't trying to make that point i wasn't trying to assert that there is no difference i just really wanted to find out for myself can i hear a difference with i think a pretty good setup here um that's gonna be better than what most people will be listening to and when i say most people i mean like 99.5 percent of people listening to music on their iphone probably not going to be listening to it out of 700 or 3000 earphones but um yeah anyway let's let me uh let me dive into chat and i guess i'll go to this camera so you got something moving but i'm going to look over here chat and and see if there's some some interesting conversation jonas kayla telling me to use a lightning to usb adapter i mean this is a lightning connector that doesn't have any other like i could run this out to a usb dac like you were asserting like i've got over here to my right i've got my stack which is a ship modi with an 8 km i believe deck in there but i don't know i've listened to these different dacs and stuff before and actually this player right here has i believe that same deck um i can't hear a difference between the dax honestly and i've tried really hard again it's the same sort of thing where i'm listening super carefully i might think that i hear a difference and i think the only time i've really heard an obvious difference in a dac that i was able to repeat it like repeatedly pick out it was listening to some ess stacks and some cheaper players where there was kind of like this this bit of a glare on some of the higher frequency stuff that i didn't pick up in the other the other decks but for the most part i just i don't hear differences between them i've got a lot of stuff and i spend a lot of time doing this so if you're if you're not the kind of person that spends a lot of time doing this sort of thing i think it's pretty pretty safe to say you're not missing out on anything um if you are the kind of person that spends a lot of time listening to this stuff in this mode and you do pick out differences i don't want to tell you that you you're you're lying or that you're fake or anything like that that's not my point at all maybe you do actually hear differences maybe you've got a better ear maybe you're just a little bit more trained and you're hearing for very you're listening for very specific things that i'm missing in this kind of setup maybe you've got you know a better setup where you've got you know like i was saying like 30 second loops of the same music or maybe even like five second loops where you can really drill in yeah maybe you might be able to hear stuff i'm not here to tell you that you can't i'm just i'm just here to say that i can't hear an obvious difference and i'm pretty confident that most people out there are not missing out by not getting into lossless what's up precog nice to see you gunner gunner jones good to see you there sean always good to see you man sai how's it going adam mobius what's up adam obi is saying uh are people listening to apple buds going to here even if they're in airpods plus answer no well for starters bluetooth like i know a lot of this is kind of became a point right apple launched lossless streaming and i saw a number of uh news article headlines talking about wow shock in awe apple's own bluetooth devices don't support their own loss of streaming but you shouldn't be surprised because zero bluetooth devices out there support lossless audio because lossless audio operates at a a bit rate that is higher than bluetooth is capable of currently it won't always be that way bluetooth will get better but for now there's no there's no loss of streaming on bluetooth diego santos saying it's like me i use lossless theoretically can't hear the difference but i want to have the highest quality possible and i think that's not only perfectly fine that's exactly what i do i like to rip my music my musics my music cds to lossless flack files because i can and i don't have to have any sort of like nagging worries in the back of my head that i'm missing out on some sort of audio quality but it's not because i really believe it sounds better just because i can and i might as well paul saying you're supposed to use the apple lightning to usb camera adapter for better sound and so what that is is it's basically it would plug into here um and it has like this large box i've actually got one over here in storage actually it's down here in storage i've rearranged my room but anyway i've got one of those and it's got a like a full size usb port on the bottom of it which would allow me to ostensibly hook one of these things up to my desktop dac my desktop stack but again i'm pretty confident that would not make a difference that i could hear i have in testing been able to hear some difference between fairly different amplifiers right so i've got over here a drop thx triple a1 solid state amplifier and i did some a b testing with that versus my valley 2 which is kind of a hybrid tube amplifier and i was able to pick out some sound differences between them they're both very similar don't get me wrong but i was able to pick out some differences there so i'm not totally deaf and i'm not totally in denial of the possibility of there being these kinds of differences i just i'm trying real hard and i'm being i'm being perfectly frank like i i don't think there's a difference in dax that's significant at least 99 of the time and i don't think that hooking this thing up to a camera connection kit and then running it into my desktop dac would make any difference in this test in fact it would ruin the test because again i don't have two of them and it's important that they're both on the exact same hardware so that that there's no added variables right and if you're saying i could use the same desktop dac and then just like unplug and plug it into this one i promise you that that difference or let's say it takes three seconds to make that transition i promise you that difference is longer that gap is long enough that your audio memory will forget any difference that is there certainly mine again i don't want to speak for everybody out there um but i'm a person that does this kind of stuff a lot and that's uh that's the pattern i i see sackable offense saying try it versus title and i think you recommending title is a sackable offense um no i saw some conversation precog calling out ditch mqa there's been a lot of controversy about mqa lately and that is um one of the compression methods that are package file file types that the title uses um yeah i i don't doubt that there are actually some downgrades in in the sound file um some very measurable and observable differences um by using mqa but i also if i'm perfectly honest like i don't think i would necessarily hear that difference based on this test i don't think mqa is going to sound worse than a 256k aac file which is what we have going on over here and if i can't hear the difference between these two i'm not at all confident that i could hear the difference between an mqa and a lossless file solely asking why don't you compare it to flax well for starters the the lossless music that's going over here on the ipad is essentially a flak it's a lac it's apple's version of flack but it's essentially the exact same compression method in fact at one point so i have all my music stored in flac and at one point i converted it all to a lack so that i could put it on my iphone i gave up that pursuit so it's all back in flack but the conversion process right i don't know if you've ever converted like an mp3 from one format to another it takes you know let's say a minute per song when i converted an entire album or entire library of flack to alac it took less than five minutes so i don't think there's any like real math going on there i don't think the compression methods are really that different which is i guess a very long way of saying listening to a lock here is going to be the exact same as listening to a flac file the the basic gist with flac and alac is that they they are still compressed files but they're compressed in what's known as a lossless way right which means that when you uncompress it you have exactly the same bits the exact same file that you had before right so if you take a file it's like maybe think of it like star star trek is that the right yeah star trek's the right one right the beam me up scotty stuff right you take you you take a a a music file on one end of the beamer transporter whatever it's in lost it's in you know it's raw uncompressed form and then you transmit it with uh well i wish i if i knew star trek better this analogy might work better but basically when that person ends up at the other end of that transport they are the exact same person that they were when they started right that's kind of how lossless compression works or maybe as a way to understand the losses compression that's not the mechanics of how it works but that is a way to understand it you end up with the same exact audio file on either end when before it's compressed and after it's uncompressed how do they do it i don't know i'm not i'm not a that's that's that's a hardcore math and that's that's above my pay grade for sure easy complex saying as a musician i never trade my flac files for mp3 it's so obvious in the drums it's simple mathematics bigger file equals more info if you can hear the difference more power to you again i'm doing this test because i wanted to see if i could hear the difference and i'm listening in the drums i'm listening in all the places where these sorts of differences are likely to stand out if i was listening to a lower resolution or a lower bitrate mp3 file like a 64. let's say even a 128 kilobit per second mp3 file i'm pretty confident i could hear that difference but i'm listening for those types of differences between these and i'm not i'm just not hearing it grant patel is saying without blind testing everything is a placebo i cannot hear a difference between 192 vbr aac and flac but that's just me everyone should try blind testing at least once i think that's a really good point it's very easy for us to trick ourselves with these sorts of tests and and to imagine that we hear something better than it used to be because we're expecting it to be better there are tools out there for blind av testing yourself there's a tool called abx it's some software i've never actually used it i assume it's windows only but it also looks really tedious and like if i thought if i was confident that i could hear a difference i would use abx to test myself because it will give you results it will like completely do the blind testing for you you you have to say whether or not you picked the right or you say whether or not you hear a difference and you have to make a call and abx will tell you whether or not you're right or wrong and it'll tell you within a margin of chance versus certainty and you know if you can if you can consistently pass an abx test i believe you you can totally hear a difference if you can't pass that test there's a good chance that what you're hearing when you plug into a high-res resolution sound source it's a good chance that what you're hearing is a placebo and that's totally fine it's totally normal definitely affects me as well um just it's okay to be a little bit skeptical of yourself and and put yourself to the test your identity is not wrapped up in this right my my identity is not that i am the person that can hear the difference between flack and and um aac if you are that person and you can actually and you think that you can prove it to yourself i would go out of your way to try and prove it to yourself and if you're wrong that's totally fine like just say i did the test and it didn't work out the way i expected doesn't mean that you don't have awesome years it just means that in that day it didn't work out for you try another day and if you continually are showing yourself that you can't hear the difference it's okay to update your priors sam moya asking did i delete the older file and re-download the larger file i'm playing i'm streaming completely over apple music over online none of these files are downloaded locally and just as a reminder i'll punch in here you can see i've got the lossless label over here on the ipad and then over here on the iphone the lossless label would show up right here but it's not there so that's how we know that i'm listening to lossless here and aac over here fixing i'm saying 256 kbps aac is an extremely good lossy codec it's always sounded better than any other codex so i haven't i mean that's an interesting point to to for you to say i have not spent any time a b testing between different lossy codex right mp3 versus aac i have done that um i mentioned earlier there's the the npr test where they've got a 128 mp3 uh i think a 320 kbps mp3 and then an uncompressed wav file in that i could pretty consistently pick out the difference between the 128 and the 320 mp3s like 128 kbps is pretty low bit rate you start to notice the things that get chopped off in that compression method but between the 320 kbps mp3 and the wav file when i wasn't using the timing trick to figure out which file was larger i could not i could not reliably pick out a pick out a difference i might try comparing apple music to title to know the difference but apple music hi-fi is not available in apple music for android yet yep that is unfortunately a limitation currently i don't expect it to be a limitation forever but in some ways i'm kind of surprised that apple music enabled lossless streaming i mean i think am so title has for a long time right they've they've relied on the uh didn't have my cam on um title has for a long time relied on marketing claims of you know mqa and and their master quality etc etc and i think that's get gotten them some support but it's you know obviously not made them bigger than spotify and then amazon music came out with their own streaming with their own lossless streaming support maybe like two years ago at this point it's been a while um but again i don't think that really stole users i mean it probably got a small audience of people that are adamant are excited about loss of streaming but again it didn't i don't think it likely ate much into spotify's audience but then spotify a couple months ago announced that they would also be going with a lossless uh a lossless quality to their stream and i think that was that basically was leaving apple as the only big music streaming service out there that didn't support lossless so i guess in that sense i'm not surprised that they went ahead and enabled lossless because the the cost to them is probably pretty cheap right most people are not going to enable it the people that do enable it you know it's still just flac files the the file sizes are not that large so i think the server expense increase is probably not going to be massive so it's kind of a kind of a cheap upgrade but i'm still a little bit surprised that apple did it because they've won they've been really adamant about the quality of aac for a long time they've been big believers in aac versus mp3 for probably the reasons that you know they don't have to pay a license to mp3 and and that's one of the reasons they like it but also they developed it and and and seemed to think that it was better than mp3 but anyway i guess what i'm saying is that like the lossless upgrade just really doesn't fit into apple's marketing very well one their their headphones that they make and sell just don't support lossless at all because they're all bluetooth they've very much steered people away from connecting you know wired wired earphones and headphones to their devices and then the other big thing is that and this is this is what what's you know makes this a little bit more surprising to me is that the the the degree of difference that we're talking here again it's so minor that i am not able to pick out the difference and for apple to say here's this new feature with lots of streaming i think a lot of people are gonna see that and and they're gonna go out of their way and and spend money trying to hear this difference and i think there's gonna be some percentage of people that will either actually be able to hear a difference or will be kind of high-res placebo into thinking they hear a difference but i think for most people it's going to be disappointing it's going to be like that's the same that sounds the same because really the kind of upgrade that you should be making is not to your file formats it should be to your earphones your headphones those things are going to make really very obvious tangible differences in your sound quality file formats it just it seems like a not a not very apple thing to do in that sense affixion with an interesting point about the avx test and this is this is getting at my lack of familiarity with that particular software because i haven't used it fixion's saying i find abx tests to be misleading they tend to use tracks that don't show weaknesses when lossy or show obvious gains when lossless i remember my library back in the day being 128kbps mp3 and back then it was known as cd quality i remember that as well or both probably a similar vintage uh even though it was nowhere near uh listening back then so all right so to your point i think that's a really interesting point and this is like i said i'm not familiar with abx the fact that it is not using your own music library is something i didn't know like it's using particular tracks um and that's not the best way to do a sort of a b test because one i think ideally you want to be listening to music that you're familiar with and which is why i've got this playlist of tracks that i use a lot this is a playlist i use for comparing a lot of earphones and testing um so i think it's important to have music that you're familiar with for starters but to your point fixion it's very possible to also craft a test with either songs that are just like dynamically really flat and no amount of compression is going to make them sound worse than they started that's totally possible and and it's interesting again i haven't used abx software myself but if that's the kind of you know music files and music sources that they're using i could see how that could be you would come to the conclusion that there's no difference when maybe under certain different circumstances you would actually hear a difference herbie d if you have good ears and good equipment you should definitely be able to tell the difference and to you herbie d i would just ask is there something wrong with these ears i think these areas are decent uh and i think that this equipment is is more than decent look again you you can quibble about whether or not this is the right deck to be using look online like do some research and you'll find that like as far as all the different ways that we can measure uh the quality of a dac and out and audio output these things actually perform pretty well not saying that there's not better than an apple dongle there are some things that measure better than an apple dongle but most people don't have those i probably don't have those and this is perfectly sufficient for me all right folks well i think that's gonna do it for this live stream i really appreciate y'all joining chatting hanging out and hopefully listening along like i put those playlists in the description down below with the hope that you could listen along with me and one not be bored while i just sat here and listen to music but also to give you context for the things i'm describing so you can hear them and see like oh yeah that is a sound that i can kind of pick up and i can hear what he's describing and maybe again maybe you can actually hear a difference that i can't hear and that's would be interesting but that's going to do it for this video really appreciate you tuning in if you haven't already please hit the like button down below helps me out helps other people find the channel subscribe to the channel if you haven't already and being that youtube bell so that youtube lets you know next time i'm live and then i'll see you in the next super review have a good weekend all right the next uh the next feature i want to talk about that was taught that they uh showed off at uh wwdc this is actually the last one as far as uh things that that were talked about the event universal control this thing is kind of magic there's a point in my life where this would have been just like so useful to me maybe a little bit less so now but this is the ability to move across a variety of devices and screens to essentially move your cursor there used to be a name for this right like there was a thing called sidecar but that was exclusive to ipad anyway the point being is i could be starting a project on an ipad like an illustration and then i could bring the ipad over to where my macbook is and just drag components like first of all have my cursor populate the device the ipad my cursor from the macbook jump over onto the ipad and then drag elements from the ipad from the project onto the macbook seamlessly yeah without any menu system prompt like just boom so they're they're calling it universal control and it doesn't stop there it's even between max so in the demonstration that federighi did he then also pulled components to uh into final cut pro right which was running on the imac from the macbook so it's across this whole string of products and devices that you might have in your life i mean that's useful it sounds pretty useful if you're managing a lot of uh devices and you know using them for each use case it's also like some projects or tasks you may prefer to do on let's say a desktop based application like i'm thinking photoshop for example i might want to get started with an illustration on a touch interface like an ipad yeah and then quickly move those elements to a photoshop project yes and then continue with like a mouse and keyboard where i feel more comfortable for that portion yeah so there it is interesting that they've been able to merge i don't know how seamless it's going to be in real life it looked good in his demo but you know the demo is heavily vetted right so we got to test this out in real life but it is that's a cool feature with apple leveraging its ecosystem you see sense of trend here these are the types of things they can do they got the os moving across yeah that's really uh that's really cool welcome back wealthy people to a new episode on the wealthup channel where we discuss everything new around tesla the cyber trunk and other ev news today we will take a look at how tesla could be merging with apple make sure to leave a like if you're excited and subscribe to the channel if you haven't already let's get into it merging two worlds the tesla apple connection when tesla revoked access to a self-driving beta test for some drivers a number of people understood what was happening behind the scenes consumer data indicated that some driving practices were not consistent with the pilot program's objectives tesco vehicles are more tech than automobile at least in the traditional sense they integrate hardware and software much like apple and the technological capabilities sometimes supersede human input the tesla apple experience has a whole lot of similarities in fact last week apple launched its first imac desktop and ipro line with m1 and early reviews uploaded the models for unmatched speeds long lasting batteries and better graphics all due in part to the processor cnn says the m1 chip is so efficient that apple now has a big advantage over its competitors yet apple didn't encourage many user previews of the m1 product reportedly hesitant to have users manipulate its closed source environment or mess with its meticulous design then again the brand loyalty that both companies inspire is so powerful that apple and tesla owners are each immersed in collective linked communities that create a gestalt of devoted togetherness moving ahead with design and innovation without tesla or apple users input is occasionally okay to these fans as long as the end products are state of the technological art tesla apple connection an iphone on wheels morgan stanley tech stock analyst katie huberty who is often bullish on apple said in a 2020 investors note that analyst tends to view tesla in a way they viewed apple 20 years ago a company that thinks differently that is incredibly innovative in a category that needs a spurt of innovation that creates investor interest when apple introduced cell phones without keyboards the new look subverted people's expectations of what was normal tesla electric cars are designed similarly a minimalist pattern with the removal of redundancies add in oversized touch screens a vast propriety fast charging network and industry leading performance and tesla made the dream of electrification a reality from 2004 through to 2018 apple's growth was fueled by the release of the iphone ipad apple watch and apple store each generating sales on par with a fortune 500 company archinvest notes that apple's unique strategy of vertical integration and consumer focus allowed it to build superior products charging higher prices and command fanatical customer loyalty tesla hired managers who brought members of their team from apple importing their design language and culture tesla's head of vehicle and mobile user interface design was a senior art director at apple and former apple employee george blankenship led tesla's retail strategy in which shopping centers showcased the revolutionary all-electric vehicles similar to apple's upscale experience focus store model the tesla apple companies managed and controlled the whole customer experience throughout the sales cycle they both don't rely on dealers or franchises but use the allure of their products to inspire word of mouth and media interest an apple in your pocket a fully electric tesla trendsetter in your garage tesla electric cars and apple electronics are marketed as premium products in their fields with the aware of high-tech innovation and rationale for both companies industry-leading product lines and generally higher purchase prices tesla still go much further on a single charge than their competitors apple like tesla integrated software with its hardware so that the competition was left blindsided both tesla and apple have released open source software two competitors that also translates to the company's leadership musk who crowned himself techno king of tesla in an sec filing resembles apple co-founder steve jobs in his fascination with and emphasis on all things tech from car repairs to software updates tesco relies on technology need a performance update tesla over-the-air updates will take care of that tesla also owns and operates manufacturing facilities not a digital native consumer don't worry both companies will offer you a series of help steps to make their new technology seem quite friendly even for the non-techie in your household both companies create products always with proprietary technology for tesla it's the wide-ranging fast charging network consisting of more than 25 000 superchargers sometimes being different has a cost of course apple focuses on hardware and software integration that has occasionally resulted in higher prices limited compatibility and a little customization according to the washington post tesco's refresh of the model s this year includes a yolk steering wheel the half moon shape is less ergonomic than racing more futuristic than practical lots of folks will adore it a few will complain bitterly tesla apple writes to privacy versus data collection for brand improvement much like musk apple ceo steve jobs was known for his disdain of market research instead insisting that apple would lead customers towards innovations that would best suit them today there's no headphone jack in its smartphones pushing consumers towards locating their own connection accessories big brother isn't finding much success in unlocking either tesla systems when a crash occurs or apple devices when an individual comes under criminal investigation each tesla soldier joins a fleet of vehicles in constant communication with its manufacturer it's been argued that the most valuable asset that tesla's base generates is data tesla's advanced sensor suite installed across hundreds of thousands of vehicles gathers billions of miles of data per year the scale of its fleet and data gathering may give taser the necessary foundations to become the first company to deploy fully autonomous driving at scale when apple was preparing to store the personal data of its chinese customers on computer servers run by a state-owned chinese firm tim cook apple's chief executive insisted the data was safe apple abandoned the encryption technology used everywhere else after china would not allow it instead according to the new york times china state employees physically manage the computers and the digital keys that unlocked information on those computers are stored in the data centers they're meant to secure cook has been on the charm offensive in china making frequent states like man visits and meeting with top leaders apple's relationship with china is rife with compromise so too is tesla's china arrangement a series of concessions china hopes to use electrification as a path to be at the top of the global auto industry and its companies and engineers need the technology and experience they can gain by working with the world's ev trendsetter tesla but last month china published draft rules to ensure the security of data that it generates by smart cars after reports that china's military banned tesla from its facilities data quenching from tesla cars in china indicated that the data is actually stored in china but the story doesn't end there tesla is developing a platform that will allow its customers to access the data that their vehicle generates your car provides data of interest to insurance companies government agencies and tesla itself it will be a huge and important change when users have access to the data that your car your possession paid for by your hard end money generates and that's it for today what do you think of tesla's merging with apple make sure to let us know in the comments down below also leave a like on the video subscribe to the channel if you haven't already this video is brought to you by neil glasgow and as always see you next time wealthy people This video is sponsored by KiwiCo. Hello the internet, I am Gav. In this video, we're gonna
be recreating a viral TikTok that a lot of you have very
kindly sent me, I thank you, of an Apple being levitated
on a jet of compressed air. Due to a phenomenon
called the Coanda effect, it should just stay exactly
in place on the compressed air until eventually it goes
a little bit too fast for itself and pops. Sounds like an excellent
subject for the Phantom. So why don't we give it a go? There certainly seems to
be some technique to it. This is 150 PSI compressor but it seems to be less about the power and more about the slow
build to keep it stable 'cause if I end up just flooring it, it bounces up and down
like this and loses speed. It's all about sort of
getting it right on the edge and then you can hear it revving up. It's actually, the sound
is the only indication I have that I know I'm doing it right. And then eventually the
sound goes high enough and you just got to clench
and hope for the best. So this apple is able to
perfectly defy gravity. As the jet of air bounces
off one side of the apple, it creates an area of low pressure between the air and the curved surface. This area of low pressure
effectively pulls in the airflow allowing it to follow
the curve of the apple. At this point, as the
curve surface of the apple is putting a force on the air, the air exerts an equal and opposite force upward on the apple and that's why it's able to
perfectly float in place. Whoa, this effect only works on objects with a curved surface. So if this was a mutated cube apple, it wouldn't work at all. It's pretty crazy, to my
eye when I'm looking at it, I'm just looking at a blur and then like one frame of
my eyes later, it's gone. It's like someone's just edited out a moment of my life there. It's so fast. Bloody hell, look at
the RPM on that thing. That is baking. Well this camera's not fast enough. That is rapid. It's moving fast in slow motion. I need to cool Alabama. All right, it's been a few days and Destin has come
through with this 2511. We now have access to 28,000
frames a second at 720p which should be a lot better
for seeing the rotation and potentially seeing
where the crack starts. Make sure you subscribe
to Smarter Everyday because he's always helping me out. Just gonna do a bit of
apple art on some of these so we can better track the rotation. Damn it. Awe, it's amazing, wow. You can actually see the skin of the apple ripping in this, at this speed. That one gave me a rollicking on the hand. If I wasn't wearing gloves, that one would really hurt I think. Okay, so now we can
roughly estimate how fast the apple was spinning by
timing how long it takes for this line to come
back around to the arrow. This was the final rotation of the apple and based on the sound it was making and the fact that it exploded, I'm gonna assume this was
the fastest rotation as well. One full rotation in 9.1 milliseconds. That's 109 rotations per second, which reveals the apples nope speed to be 6565 RPM. That was something, that was very sweaty, very loud and slightly terrifying work but I do think we've got some
lovely looking footage there especially with the 2511. We saw a lot more that we didn't see at 1000 frames a second,
like the skin ripping almost as though the inside
of the apple has already split And the skin is just the
final thing to give away. Absolutely mental and I
think I do now have to invest in some sort of long handled mop to clean the ceiling and the walls. Made a right mess in this one. I think it was worth it though. I think it was worth seeing. I've never seen it that slow. Now I'd like to talk to you about the sponsor of this video, KiwiCo. KiwiCo is a wonderful

because about was it two weeks ago three weeks ago apple music announced that in june they would be extending their streaming service to include cd quality across the board and then high-res content for a small percentage of the library which is about 70 million songs i think the big news about this new service is that it's coming with no price increase however i want to tackle this because as many of you know like apple until recently streamed with the aac codec but it was still a lossy codec and then when we moved to see the quality streaming we are now at lossless so no data is being thrown away now the puzzling thing for me with apple music announcing cd quality streaming high-res streaming is that if you have a pair of bluetooth headphones even apple's own bluetooth headphones bluetooth does not do cd quality streaming not even with ldac not with aptx i feel like a broken record because i talk about this all the time but the thing is is it that's a bit of a gotcha for now but apple might solve that but here's the other thing right is that if you want to use wired headphones with an iphone you're going to need some kind of adapter so you either have this this kind of like a apple zone adapter usb here i know some people prefer the bigger one and then you need another adapter i'll show you why in a moment so we need like a usb a to usbc adapter so then we can plug in something like a zorlu stella so then we can connect headphones here look at this this is just i'm sorry i've said this before it's kind of dongle hell no i'm not down with that even even if we can get lossless or high-res out of the lightning port here to that now you might say well okay john but there are products that do lightning audio and i've got one of those here this is the audeze sign headphone and i've got the mfi approved so made for iphone this is like an inline dac so on one end oops on one end we have the lightning plug and then these are obviously connected to the headphones yes we can connect this but i'm pretty sure that this is limited to 24-bit 48. yeah a little bit of a gotcha there for high-res fanciers with this particular type of product what about if we move to an android phone now an android phone has a usb socket on the bottom or most of them do anyway and that's quite good because we can connect a little usb dongle dac like this but as i've covered before everything coming out of this is resampled to 48 kilohertz by the android operating system and that spoils the party even for cd quality now here's the thing is that if you take a 1644 file and let android resample it to even 1648 does it mess up the sound that much probably not but if you're a purist and you want bit perfect audio out of your android device and you want to use apple music i don't think there's a way around it because for tidal and kobo's you can use usb audio player pro which integrates tidal and kobo's and then loads in its own usb driver here so we get high-res coming out no problem but usb audio player pro does not integrate apple music yeah and it's unlikely too because it's such a tiny tiny bit player when sat next to the enormity i mean you can't well maybe some of you can but like the size of apple it's just gargantuan like next to apple roon is a minnow or ivana is a minnow so we're it's really unlikely we're ever going to see roon or audivana or any of these apps provide a wrapper for apple music so that limits our possibilities when it comes to hardwiring a network streaming situation into a hi-fi system like for speakers like i've got behind me so we could we could just take a three and a half mil to dual rca and tap the audio that comes out of a macbook like this but as i've covered many times before this doesn't really sound it doesn't really sound very good therefore we can obviously use a usb dac like this wrong side sorry this is a m1 macbook air so we connect that here that's usbc and then that goes out to the hifi system that will sound a bit better but that relies on using apple's own desktop app because as i've said there is no desktop app that i know of like roon or ivana that wraps apple music so this is as good as it gets you're gonna have to use you know have this in your hi-fi rack and use the mouse to choose to play music which for some people is fine for some people that's fine but audio nerds who are used to network streaming i don't know i think they might not be okay with that because many many people don't want to have a computer in their hifi rack now what about network streamers you know companies like aurelik or premier their apps that come with their streaming devices support title cobos sometimes it's yeah blue sound as well sometimes it's amazon sometimes they have that but none of them none of them have apple music there is i think the only network streamer that's currently on the market that supports apple music is a sonoff streamer so that's a problem so there isn't really an elegant way because there's no such thing as like apple music connect so getting apple music streams into a hi-fi system using a network streamer we have to rely on airplay and that means we can only use an iphone or a mac so we you know we fire up a stream on our phone like this and then we select with a drop down the airplay endpoint to which we want to send the stream but we're not handing off the stream this is the thing this is why it's different to spotify connect is that the stream travels over the air into the phone and then from the phone to the network streamer that supports airplay and if we turn the phone off or leave the house the music stops because this is an integral part of the chain it's not like spotify connect or tidal connect the other option we have is to use chromecast that's that button up there little square button that does allow us to hand off our stream to a suitably equipped chromecast supporting streamer but as you know as i've said many times before the downside of using chromecast is it's not gapless so if you're playing an album that relies on gapless playback then you're out of luck which i think for me it's a deal breaker no gapless no deal so again we're back to using a usb dac with our computer those of you thinking oh yeah i can just bluetooth from my phone to my network streamer yes you can but as we know bluetooth is lossy and there's no real point in stepping your apple music supply up to cd quality audio only to stream it over bluetooth which is lossy because you may also just stick with aac in the first place i think really and besides like bluetooth for me is only really good outside of the house or useful outside of the house and that's the thing as you probably know is as we step through all of these situations there's a gotcha so i think that apple music have a long way to go to make it easier to realize the benefits of cd quality and high res in our hi-fi system so apple music really needs like a connect type service whether they will do that i don't know um so yeah if you like this video please hit the like button down below if you like my attitude towards high-end audio in that i can just kind of just sit down and ramble through the pitfalls and the gotchas of apple music then please subscribe to this channel and as always thank you ever so much for watching >> My desk is on the seventh floor,

[ Applause and Cheering ] I'm so glad that really can't happen. Welcome to WWDC. It's great to be back in San Jose, the heart of Silicon Valley and right down the street from Apple and our new campus. It's been 15 years since we held the developer conference in San Jose and an awful lot has changed. But the one thing that hasn't changed is our commitment to the developer community and our ability to do amazing things together. This is going to be the best and biggest WWDC ever. [ Applause and Cheering ] Every year, we host WWDC to bring Apple engineers and our amazing developers together on our collective mission to change the world. And I'm pleased to tell you, the Apple Developer community has never been more vibrant. We now have 16 million registered developers in the program around the world. And we added three million last year alone. We've got 5300 developers here this morning, our largest group ever. We have attendees this morning from 75 countries across the world. It's truly a worldwide conference. And we have the most student developers with us this morning ever. [ Applause and Cheering ] In fact, one of our youngest is here this morning. His, his name is Yuma Sorianto. He's from Australia and he's just 10 years old. He started coding when he was six and he already has five apps on the App Store. [ Applause and Cheering ] I met Yuma yesterday and I can't wait to see what he's going to accomplish next. And while we've got some great up and coming developers like Yuma, we got some that got a bit of a later start, Masako. Masako Wakamiya is just 82 years old and she's from Japan and she published her first app earlier this year. So-- [ Applause and Cheering ] So, if you haven't published yet, there is still time. Let's give them a big round of applause. [ Applause and Cheering ] Now, let's turn our attention to our four incredible platforms. Of course as you know each of them stem from the same core technology, but each is uniquely expressed and designed for the best experience for where they work. We keep pushing these platforms forward giving you, the developers, powerful tools and opportunities to change the world. That's why this developer conference is so important. Now, we have a lot to talk about today. And I do mean a lot. So, I'm dispensing with the updates other than to tell you, Apple is doing great. [ Applause and Cheering ] We have six important announcements to share with you this morning. So, let's get right into it and I'll start with tvOS. We recently introduced the TV app on Apple TV, iPhone and iPad to create the easiest way to discover and enjoy your TV content from across your video channels all in one convenient place. We launched it with support from just a handful of video channels but now, we have 50 partners integrated into the TV app. And today, we're really thrilled to announce that Amazon is coming-- [ Applause and Cheering ] -- Amazon is coming to the TV app and Apple-- and all Apple TVs later this year with Amazon Prime Video. And, of course, as you know, Prime Video provides a wealth of great content, thousands of TV shows and movies and some great original content like "Transparent", "Mozart in the Jungle", "Man in the High Castle" and so much more. We are so pleased to welcome Amazon to Apple TV. [ Applause ] So that's tvOS. You'll be hearing a lot more about tvOS later this year. Number two, let's talk about Apple Watch. [ Applause and Cheering ] Apple Watch has had incredible growth this past year. In fact it's the number one selling smartwatch by far. And what's most important to us is that it's number one in customer satisfaction again by far. Apple Watch is designed to help you live a healthier life. And people are absolutely loving the fitness capabilities, the health capabilities, the quick access to information and even the ability to swim with it. We've got some exciting updates to the watchOS and to take you through them, I'd like to invite Kevin Lynch up. Kevin? [ Applause and Cheering ] >> Thank you, Tim. >> So watchOS is moving forward really quickly. And I'm very excited to introduce watchOS 4 today. This furthers the areas that people love. It also introduces new ways to make the watch more personal to you. Let's start with watch faces. Now, Apple Watch is great for quickly glancing at information. And many people are using a watch face like this today. And now, you need to choose what information shows up here. So for example weather, calendar and workouts, or maybe you'd like to look at the date and reminders and sunset. The information that you like to see actually varies based on time and your location and your routines. What if we could actually show you a selection of information that you might need automatically? Well, Siri is becoming more and more a proactive assistant knowing what information you need when you need it. And we've created a new watch face, which is powered by Siri intelligence. This is the new Siri watch face. Now, it automatically displays the information that's most relevant to you. And it can also access Siri by tapping on the new complication on the top left. And it automatically displays this information with the same type of intelligence we've applied on iOS. We're using machine learning to adapt automatically based on your routines and the apps that you use when you use them. So in the morning, I might see for example, can you time in my first meeting. And if I rotate the Crown, I can see more information from Siri. For example, reminders or even photo memories from the same time last year or maybe from this location. And throughout the day, whenever you raise your wrist, the face will dynamically update with the information for you. So for example at noon, I might see a reminder to make a call and I might get a pass to a flight that I'm taking that afternoon. So, relevant passes in Wallet can appear here right in the face including from third party apps. Now, at the end of the day, I might see what time the sun is going to set and also, I can get access to controls I tend to use in the home app at night. So this is an intelligent proactive assistant right on your wrist. And this is the new Siri face on Apple Watch. [ Applause and Cheering ] Now, sometimes you might like kind of less information and more graphics. And that's the soul of the new Kaleidoscope face. It displays a beautiful symmetrical pattern that slowly changes throughout the day. And you can rotate the Crown and you can get this kind of trippy effect whenever you want. And there's multiple styles you can choose from. So for example if you use a photo like this, you can create a variety of Kaleidoscope styles. This is the new Kaleidoscope face. [ Applause and Cheering ] Now, Mickey and Minnie have been a big hit on Apple Watch and more characters have been working to find their way in. And I'm really excited to welcome Woody, and Jessie and Buzz. [ Applause and Cheering ] They're going to be right at home inside the watch and there's so much fun. And whenever you raise your watch with the Toy Story Face, you're going to see a variety of vignettes kind of like this. [ Laughter ] There's a lot of hijinks going on in there. So these are three really lively new faces in watchOS, Siri face, Kaleidoscope and Toy Story. [ Applause ] Now, let's talk about Activity. Apple Watch has already been helping many people improve their health and fitness. And Activity is one of the most frequently used apps on the watch. In watchOS 4, Activity notifications are more personalized to you. There'll be "Close Your Rings" more often. So you might start off each day with some inspiration by receiving an update like this. This lets you know if you're close to accomplishing an achievement or what you can do to match yesterday's goals. And these are all personalized to you. And as part of the smarter coaching, we're also introducing monthly challenges. And these challenges are designed to help you either beat or repeat something that you accomplish or came close to doing and they're all achievable because they're based on your real history. And like every great coach, we want to celebrate your success so we've added a little bit more fun when you close your rings or earn an achievement. [ Applause ] So you get smaller celebrations for everyday successes and bigger celebrations for harder to reach milestones. Now, we've also enhanced the Workout App to be even easier to use and more powerful. Starting with the new UI where quick start is right up front, you can just tap and go. It's much easier. And customers have really loved the new swimming capabilities in Siris too. And we're now enhancing the pool swim workout with auto-sets. So just by taking a rest at the edge of the pool, it'll automatically mark each set of swimming that you're doing. And at the end, you'll even get your distance for each stroke type and your pace for each set that you're doing. We also are creating-- It's great, pool swim thing is very popular. We've also created some custom motion and heart rate algorithms for a new workout type called High Intensity Interval Training. Now, this is one of the most popular workouts in the world. So we know it's going to be a favorite for a lot of you when you start using it. Now, if you like to do more than one workout in a row, it's now super easy to just swipe over during a current workout and then add another one by pressing the plus button. You just press plus and I can continue with another workout. For example, I might do outdoor cycling here. I just tap and I continue, super easy now to do multiple workouts in a single session. [ Applause ] Now, many people are doing the workouts indoors at a gym. And when you use gym equipment, it has data the Apple Watch doesn't have and the watch has data the gym equipment doesn't have. So you end up with numbers like calories and distance that don't quite match. So in watchOS 4, we've come up with a great solution to this. We're enabling for the first time two-way data exchange in real-time with gym equipment. So you'll be able to simply tap your Apple Watch, on an NFC reader on the gym equipment. Your watch will automatically launch the Workout App and you can connect. And then your heart rate is read by the watch and sent to the equipment. And data like incline and speed is sent from the equipment to your watch. And when you start and stop the workout in your gym machine, it does the same thing on your watch. So now, all the information matches, it's much easier and it's a lot more accurate. Now, this is being supported by the largest gym manufacturers in the world, provided about 80% of equipment in gyms today. And Apple Watch-enabled equipment will be rolling out starting this fall. [ Applause ] Now let's talk about music. Apple Watch paired with AirPods has really become a magical combination. And where redesigning the music app and watch makes this a really great experience. With the new music app, we're going to automatically sync music for you based on what you love to listen to. So for example, it'll automatically get your Apple Music mixes like new music and favorites freshly updated on your watch. And the app simply presents some beautiful album art and playlist images and you can just navigate by rotating the Digital Crown. When you get the album you like, you can just tap and play. So you can easily play your music now and we support multiple playlist and music on the watch now. So your music that you love is going to be ready when you are and making Apple Watch and AirPods a truly magical listening experience. That's the new music app. [ Applause ] Now, let's take a look at this. To give you a quick demo of watchOS 4, please welcome Vera Carr from the Watch and Health Engineering team. [ Applause and Cheering ] >> Thank you, Kevin. Good morning. I'm so excited to be here. The first thing I want to show you is the new doc. I can now vertically scroll through my recently used apps like the new music app. Using the doc makes finding the apps I'm looking for easier than ever. Next, let's look at the new intelligent Siri watch face. Here in the morning, I could see things like the weather for today and my upcoming events. Later today, I'm heading back to San Francisco to see my parents. And in the afternoon, the Siri face will proactively update to tell me how long it will take me to get there. Tonight, we're going to see the new "Alien" movie, which I'm super excited about. No one spoil it for me. For any content in the Siri face, I could tap directly into the app for more details. Here for example, the Siri face has my ticket so tonight, I can just raise my wrist and with one tap, they'll be ready. The Siri face also shows me timely content like photo memories and news. Here's a news headline picked for me by the brand new news app now available on Apple Watch. In the app, I can view stunning photos, glance at top news stories throughout the day and save them for later to be read on my phone. We've also integrated our new Activity coaching notifications directly into the Siri face. Now, when it's near the end of your day or you're close to closing your rings, our coach algorithms will tell you how much you need to walk to get your move goal. I did a lot of nervous pacing before this so now, I just need to take a 16-minute walk. Let's close those rings. We've added something new here in Workout that's really cool. Music instantly gets me motivated and now in watchOS 4, I can pick a playlist that automatically starts with my workout. Let's do it. [ Music ] And when I'm in a workout, I can quickly swipe to the left and control my music right here. [ Applause and Cheering ] These are only a few of the new features in watchOS 4. I can't wait for you to try it out. Back to Kevin to tell you more. [ Applause and Cheering ] >> Terrific job, Vera. Thank you. There's a lot more coming in watchOS 4 including, for example, a new flashlight in the control center, which you can also use as a blinking safety light when you're doing an evening run. So, a lot, lot more happening here. Now, we of course have a number of updates that enable great apps by developers in watchOS including more support for apps running in the background, faster app responsiveness and some new UI capabilities. And we're also now supporting native Core Bluetooth on the watch, which is going to enable experiences for apps that work with small devices around you. So for example, continuous glucose monitoring, directly from Dexcom sensor to your watch, or a Zepp Tennis, which connects to a sensor on your racket for real-time swing analysis when you're playing, or a sensor which connects your watch to your surfboard so you can actually see the height of the waves you're doing and how many calories you're burning while you're still on the water. So, lots of new possibilities here for watchOS. [ Applause ] Developer preview is available today so you can get going. And there's a free upgrade for everyone across all watches this fall. And that's just some of what's coming in watchOS 4. Please welcome Tim back to the stage. Thank you. >> Thanks, Kevin. [ Cheering Applause ] WatchOS 4 is a great update. Now, let's talk about a product that in many ways is the heart and soul of Apple. And, of course, I'm talking about the Mac. [ Applause and Cheering ] There's never been a computer quite like the Mac. The Mac is so important in fueling the world's passion and creativity. It's a computer all of us love to use and no one can match the Mac's deep integration of hardware and software. And, of course, at the heart of the Mac experience is macOS. And to tell you about what's next with macOS, please welcome Craig Federighi, Craig. [ Applause and Cheering ] >> Thank you. Thank you, Tim. Hey, good morning. Well, let's talk about macOS. Now, our current release of macOS, of course, is macOS Sierra. Now, Sierra brought Siri and Apple Pay to the Mac let you put your documents and your desktop in the cloud and even let you unlock your Mac automatically using the watch on your wrist. Now, people are loving Sierra and we love it too. So, we wanted to spend this year perfecting it. Of course, the question is, what do we call it? [ Laughter ] So we enlisted once again our crack marketing team. They were giddy to hop in their mini bus and this time, venture east, deep into the Sierras but this time, ascending its highest peaks. And when they finally came back, they had a name they said felt really, really good. And it's my privilege to announce for you today, macOS High Sierra. [ Applause and Cheering ] Now, we talked to the guys and we said there might be-- this might be misconstrued but they assured us this name is fully baked. So-- [ Laughter ] Now, High Sierra is all about deep technologies that provide a powerful platform for future innovations on the Mac. But we couldn't help ourselves, we also added some refinements. And it starts with Safari. Now, Safari is known for its efficiency and it's a legendary battery life but safari is also incredibly fast. In fact, we benchmarked Safari on the same hardware running macOS and Windows with all the popular browsers and Safari smokes them in benchmark after benchmark, JetStream, Speedometer, MotionMark. Safari tops them all. That's right, Safari is the world's fastest desktop browser with High Sierra. [ Applause ] And Safari's domination continues with the new modern version of JavaScript, ECMAScript 5. We can see Safari delivers 80% faster performance than Chrome. Now, in addition to being tremendously fast, Safari also helps give you a serene browsing experience. Now, you know, sometimes you go to read an article and instead of finding something to read, you get this. [ Music ] Just some loud audio and video that autoplays and disrupts your whole reading vibe. Well, now, don't worry about it because we have autoplay blocking in Safari. [ Applause and Cheering ] Safari detects the sites that shouldn't be playing video and puts you in control. You can always push play. Now, Safari is also key in respecting your privacy. Now, have you ever had this experience where you go to buy something on the web and you even complete the purchase. And it seems like everywhere you go on the web, it just follows you around. It kind of feels like you're being tracked and that's because you are. [ Laughter ] No longer, because Safari has Intelligent Tracking Prevention. [ Applause and Cheering ] Safari uses machine learning to identify trackers, segregate the cross-site scripting data, put it away, so now, your privacy, your browsing history is your own. It's not about blocking ads, the web behaves as it always did, but your privacy is protected. Next, I want to talk about some refinements to Mail and it starts with search. So in addition to providing searches based on recency, search in Mail is now using Spotlight to identify your top hits. So the message you're looking for is almost always right there at the top. And if you're into using Mail in full-screen, well now, we support Split View for your compose window. It's a great way to compose mail. [ Applause ] And Mail is more efficient than ever. It actually uses 35% less disk space for storing your mail. Now, probably our biggest area of refinement in High Sierra is in photos. Now-- Yeah, photos has some great new organization and editing tools. There's a persistent sidebar and a new view that has all your imports in chronological order. And in any view up here on the upper right, you can filter by your keywords, by your favorites, by just media types like video so it's really easy to get to just what you're looking for. We've also improved faces. It recognizes far more faces automatically using advanced convolutional neural networks. And when you put effort into categorizing and naming people, well, that's now synchronized automatically across all your devices. [ Applause ] Now, we also have some great enhancements to editing inside a photo. So you can see here on the right-hand side, all of your editing tools array. And there are bunch of great new ones, including Curves which allows you to fine-tune the color and contrast in your image. And Selective Color will teach you modify color in a selective range. And I think you're going to like this one because if you like to do edits in a ProTool like Pixelmator or Photoshop, well now, when you punch out to that other editing tool, all of your edits automatically synchronize right back to your photo library. [ Applause ] Now, Apple pioneered printed books. Based on projects, you construct right inside of the photo application. And now, we're opening this up to third parties. They're going to offer some amazing new printing services, full-framed wall, mounted photos, and even publishing websites, all based on projects right inside of photos. So those are some quick refinements but I want to return to the main story now and that's technology, this-- because we've gone deep on the fundamentals, data, video and graphics. And when it comes to data, the fundamentals are in the file system. Now, the Mac File System has its roots actually, HFS from 30 years ago. Well, a lot has changed since then. We have a lot of flash drives or storage is a billion times larger and it's time for more modern file system. So, I'm pleased to announce that we're bringing the Apple File System to macOS as our new default. [ Applause and Cheering ] Now, APFS is a thoroughly modern file system, 64-bit top to bottom. It's safe and secure with built-in crash protection and native encryption. And it's ultra responsive with modern features like instant file and directory cloning and high performance parallellized metadata operations. Now, what does that really mean in practice? Well, let's take a look at a simple file duplication inside of Sierra. So we're going to go up to the File menu. It's like duplicate on this very large video files. And it's going to copy. And just like you'd expect, there's a lot of data to be copied here so it takes a little while, just about done, there we go. Now, let's watch that in High Sierra. Well, we're going to go up to the File menu, we're going to subduplicate, and we're done. [ Applause and Cheering ] Next up, video. Now, the current standard in video is H.264. In fact, H.264 has really enabled the revolution of streaming HD video on the Internet. But, of course, the game is moved from HD to 4K and 4K high dynamic range video. And there's a new standard to support this, it's H.265 or HEVC. And you want your video to look great, preserve all the detail and color, and HEVC does it while saving up to 40% better compression than H.264. Now, we're building in software encoder support in the High Sierra for all Macs and hardware acceleration of HEVC for the newest Macs. And we're also building it into ProTools, like Final Cut, Motion, and Compressor. Now, I want to return to our main story which is graphics and graphics are all about the GPU. The GPU has been the performance superstar of the last decade delivering incredible gains in computational performance. Now, our API for high-performance graphics is Metal. And developers have taken amazing advantage of Metal. This is Dawn of War III from Feral Interactive, incredible graphics. This is DaVinci Resolve from Blackmagic which can accelerate many editing operations. And, of course, we even use Metal inside of photos for doing machine learning in identifying your photos. But we've learned a lot working with developers and their adoption of Metal and we have a new version to announce today. And you'll never guess what we called it. It's Metal 2. [ Laughter ] Now, Metal 2 is tremendously fast. In fact, it has great optimizations and new APIs that when adopted, deliver another 10 times improvement in draw call throughput. Now, some of you remember when Metal first came out, it itself had a 10 times improvement over OpenGL. You can multiply those numbers together. That's a hundred times improvement. Now, we've also provided better-- sorry, debugging and performance analysis tools for you to optimize your app for Metal. And we're so excited about the advances in Metal 2 that we've taken the Mac Window Server and put it on top of Metal, accelerating things like Mission Control. And some of our most challenging system animations are now buttery smooth all the time. Now, Metal is not just about graphics. We're also using it for machine learning. It can now accelerate-- yes, we have Metal performance shaders to accelerate all kinds of deep learning algorithms. Another piece of Metal news today is Metal for external graphics. So, you know our MacBooks have this tremendous balance of portability and power. But sometimes for some workflows, you need even more power. You want to take advantage of the incredible Thunderbolt IO on your MacBook Pros to access external graphics. So we're going to be making this possible in Metal 2. Now, we're starting with the Developer Kit that will be available today. You can actually order a Thunderbolt 3 enclosure with a high-performance AMD GPU and tune your apps for high-performance external graphics. And then we'll be rolling out support to all of our customers in the months to come. Now, with these graphics power, we're really doubling down on our focus on Pro content creation. And that's increasingly about VR content creation. And so, we're bringing Metal for VR to High Sierra. [ Applause ] Now Metal is delivering a VR-optimized display pipeline that provides extremely high performance. And we're optimizing our Pro apps like Final Cut for doing things like editing spherical video right inside the VR environment. We're also working with Valve. They're bringing the SteamVR, SVK to the Mac. And we work with Unity and Unreal to bring their engines for VR to the Mac. [ Applause and Cheering ] It's really cool and you might just be seeing a little bit more from us later today on this topic. So that's a quick look at macOS. Some great technologies with the Apple File System, HEVC Video and incredible graphics with Metal 2 support for external graphics and VR support of the Mac and, of course, a bunch of fantastic refinements. Now, macOS High Sierra is available for all of you today as a developer beta. And if you sign up at beta.apple.com, we'll also have a public beta available later at this month and, of course, it's shipping to everyone as a free upgrade this fall on all systems that support Sierra. Now, that's your update on macOS High Sierra and I'm going to turn it over to our vice president of Hardware Engineering, John Ternus, to tell you more about the Mac. Thank you. [ Applause and Cheering ] >> Thank you, Craig. So, we have some great updates to talk about today that span much of the Mac product line. And let's begin with the iMac. Now, the iMac has been the gold standard of desktops for many years but we're going to raise the bar once again. And as always on the iMac, it starts with the display. Because the 4K and 5K Retina iMac displays with their high resolution, excellent brightness and P3 color gamut, are the best displays on any desktop. But we're going to make them even better. So these new displays are now going to be 500 nits. That's 43% brighter than the previous generation. And for the first time, we're going to support 10-bit dithering, which means these displays can reproduce up to a billion colors. So, your content is going to look more true to life than ever before. Now, in addition, we've got some great internal updates for these iMacs. So we'll start with the CPU because the whole line is moving to Intel's 7th-generation Core Processor, also known as Kaby Lake. Now, Kaby Lake gets this better base and turbo frequencies for more performance as well as hardware-based 10-bit HEVC decode which is great for playing back high quality video. In addition, these iMacs are getting a boost when it comes to memory capacity. So the 21.5-inch systems can now be configured with up to 32 gigs of memory. And the 27-inch can go all the way up to 64 gigabytes of memory. Both of those are twice what the previous generation can do. Now, fast storage has always been a key part of the iMac. And so, we're going to now make our Fusion Drive standard on all 27-inch configs. And it's also going to be standard on the high-end 21.5-inch config as well. In addition, our SSD options are going to be up to 50% faster and now available up to 2 terabytes. And the iMacs are getting an IO upgrade as well because we're giving them two USB-C connectors which support Thunderbolt 3. And we think our customers especially our Pro users are really going to love this because you can do some cool things like hook up a high-performance RAID array and an external 5K display at the same time. So now, let's talk about graphics. And as you heard earlier, we're investing heavily in graphic software technologies like Metal 2. Well, we're also investing in graphics hardware. And every configuration in this new iMac line is going to get a big bump in its graphics performance. So we'll start with the entry-level iMac. Now this system gets a boost in its integrated GPU by way of Intel's Iris Plus Graphics which now has 64 megabytes of eDRAM. And the performance that we're getting out of this is pretty amazing because this system is up to 80% faster in graphics than the previous generation. [ Applause and Cheering ] Now next up is the 21.5-inch iMac with Retina 4K display. And the big news here is that we're going to be moving to discrete graphics and making it standard on all 4K iMacs. And that's going to come-- There you go. And that's going to come in this Radeon Pro series GPUs with up to 4 gigabytes of VRAM. And again, this move to discrete graphics yield to pretty spectacular performance increase because this new system is up to three times faster than the previous generation for graphics. [ Applause and Cheering ] Now, lastly, we have our 27-inch iMAc. And this is our most popular desktop for our Pro customers. So obviously, it's going to get a bump in graphics today as well. So it's going to have this Radeon Pro 500 series GPUs with up to 8 gigabytes of VRAM. And again, we get a great performance uplift. In fact, this 27-inch iMac can now deliver up to 5.5 teraflops of graphics to you. [ Applause and Cheering ] Which makes it a great platform for VR content creation. In fact, we've seated some developers with this new iMac in High Sierra so that we could see what they can do with virtual reality on the Mac. And I'm really excited that we can give you a demo of some of this amazing work right now. So, I'd like to invite up on the stage, here from Industrial Light & Magic is academy-award winning visual effects artist and Chief Creative Officer John Knoll. John. [ Applause and Cheering ] >> Thank you, John. [ Applause and Cheering ] At Lucasfilm's ILMxLab, story, concept design and technical development are all intertwined. They come together for us to create immersive experiences for people to enjoy at home, in cinemas and at theme parks. Now, I've always done my art and development on the Mac so I'm really excited about these new iMacs. I truly love the platform so I'm especially excited to be able to share some of our VR content created on these new iMacs and Epic's Unreal Engine. I'm joined by Lauren Ridge, an Epic programmer who will be at backstage driving our demo. Working together, we can work in real-time to create an immersive experience as we step inside the "Star Wars" universe. Now, Lauren's backstage so we can show you the environment around her. >> And now, we're going to show you from my perspective. Here, we are in the planet Mustafar. Thanks to the native VR support in macOS High Sierra, I can use Unreal Engine's editor to create content inside the VR experience. And for the first time, it's all powered by my Mac. On my left motion controller, I have my Radial Menu, which accesses my artist palette. Now on the right, I have the laser I use to interact with the world and some fire here. So, let's try that out. >> All right. Very nice. Let's do some set dressing. What do you have? >> Let's see. Let me open my content browser. It has all the assets I need to dress my scene. I think I saw that landing spot for an imperial shuttle over here so let's bring one of those in. We've actually set up the smart assets so they know exactly where to come in for their landing. >> Great, all right. Can we go wide? >> Sure. I can grab on to them with two hands and scale myself up. I can also use this to rotate the world around me. >> Very cool. >> I have a TIE fighter here too so let's bring one of those in. Thanks to the more than five and a half teraflops of GPU performance, manipulating objects is super smooth and really intuitive. >> Great, all right. Can we have a squadron of those flying overhead? >> OK, what about from over there on the horizon. So, over there by the castle. >> Right. Perfect, OK. >> Right, let me teleport back down. >> Hey, seeing the castle back there reminds me, we're missing one important element. >> Right, how could I forget? >> All right. Nice. All right, that's really good. Saw that against the sky back there. Can we go in closer? >> Sure thing. It's really cool how Metal 2 unlocks Unreal's advanced rendering feature set on the map. >> Wow, yeah, really nice. All right, now let's play the scene from here. >> OK. [ Sound Effects ] [ Music ] >> Oh he's upset. That's the third one this week. [ Sound Effects ] >> Whoa, I'm glad he didn't see me there. >> Wouldn't be so sure about that. [ Music ] All right, actually, let's stop it right there. >> That was a close one. [ Laughter ] [ Applause ] >> Well, it's really nice to see in iMac rendering this level of graphics in VR mode at a smooth 90 frames a second. Really great. All right, thank you, Lauren. [ Applause ] Metal 2 and Unreal's-- or Epic's Unreal Engine would enable the next generation of storytellers. We use this technology in our filmmaking every day for virtual set scouting, for art direction and shot design. And that means that this immersive content can be made by the same people that bring you the films. That's incredibly powerful. At Lucasfilm and ILMxLab, we're looking forward to using our Macs to create new experiences as we invite people everywhere to step inside our stories. Thank you. [ Applause ] Well, thank you. [ Applause ] Thank you, John and Lauren. That was awesome. So that is our update to the iMac line. And to recap, they have the best Mac displays we've ever made, faster processors, higher memory capacity, super fast storage, Thunderbolt 3, and as you saw, incredible graphics performance. So, here is the line and-- but there's one more change because we're going to bring even more value to the iMac product line. For the first time ever, we're going to have a 4K iMac that starts at just $1299. [ Applause ] But the updates don't stop with just the iMac because we're refreshing our notebooks today as well. And together, the MacBook and MacBook Pro make up the strongest line of notebooks we've ever had. But we're going to make them even better because we're moving to Kaby Lake here as well. And we're bringing faster SSDs to our MacBook and faster standard graphics to the 15-inch MacBook Pro. So a great performance bump across the board. So here is that lineup. But just like the iMac, we're going to bring more value here as well because we're going to have a new configuration of the 13-inch MacBook Pro that also starts at just $1299. [ Applause ] So there you'd have it. We've updated seven of our most popular Macs and the MacBook Air is going to get a bump in megahertz as well. And even better, they're all shipping today. [ Applause ] Now, we care deeply about the environment. And so as with all our products, we've been working really hard to ensure that these new Macs are free of harmful chemicals, very energy efficient and highly recyclable. So that's everything we're updating today. But, it's not actually everything we want to show you today. Now the iMac line has incredible breadth. It spans from an entry level system that's perfect for use at home or in a school, all the way up through that powerhouse 27-inch model which allows professional customers to create amazing things every day. But that said, there's another class of Pro users who would love to be able to take advantage of the iMac's display and design, but they need workstation class performance that can't possibly fit into an all-in-one. Well, we wanted to challenge that assumption, and so we've been working really hard to see just how far we can push the iMac. Now, this isn't going to be shipping until the end of the year but I'm really excited to be able to give you a sneak peek of what we've been up to, and here it is. [ Music ] [ Applause ] Cool. So that is the new iMac Pro. Now, the first thing you'll notice, it features the same great design as our 27-inch iMac but it's in this seriously badass space gray finish. And with that stunning new color and gorgeous 5K display, this is without a doubt the most beautiful iMac we've ever made. But it's also going to be by far the most powerful iMac we've ever made. In fact, this would be the most powerful Mac we've ever made because-- [ Applause ] Because we actually are going to put workstation class performance into our incredible 5K iMac design. Now to do that, the team had to completely rethink the thermal architecture, and they came up with this really efficient dual centrifugal fan solution which generates significantly more airflow than a traditional iMac. In fact, the iMac Pro has a greater than 80% increase in cooling capacity. So that means we can deliver unbelievable performance while still maintaining the quiet operation you'd expect from an iMac. So let's talk about what's inside and I want to start with the CPU because we wanted to go really big here. So the iMac Pro is going to ship with an 8-core Xeon processor. [ Applause ] But it's also going to ship with a 10-core Xeon processor. [ Applause ] And then we thought, you know, we've gone this far, let's get really nutty. So we're going to offer it with up to 18-core. [ Applause and Cheering ] That is a ton of compute power. But we didn't want to stop there because we wanted to go really big on graphics as well. So the iMac Pro is going to use AMD's Radeon Vega graphics. This is a brand new workstation class graphics architecture. It features a completely new GPU core and high bandwidth on packaged memory. It's going to be available with up to 16 gigabytes of VRAM and over 400 gigabytes per second of memory bandwidth. And we aren't going to use an entry level configuration here because our implementation is going to offer up to 11 teraflops of single precision compute power. That's three times more than the best GPU in the Mac Pro. But it actually gets even better because this Radeon Vega GPU can also do half precision compute. So that means the iMac Pro can deliver up to 22 teraflops of half precision computation. This is a really big deal for things like machine learning development. So the iMac Pro as you can see is going to be a monster when it comes to graphics, but we didn't want to stop there either. So we're going to let you configure it with up to 128 gigabytes of ECC memory. That's twice what you can do on a standard 27-inch iMac. [ Applause and Cheering ] And up to 4 terabytes of 3 gigabyte per second SSD. Now, the iMac Pro is also going to have a full complement of high performance I/O including four Thunderbolt 3 ports and for the first time ever in any Mac, built-in 10 gigabit Ethernet. [ Applause ] And with all that cutting edge I/O, you can do some pretty amazing things. So you can hook up two 5K displays in two high-performance RAID arrays, no iMac before could ever do that. And when you combine that with the internal display, that means the iMac Pro can drive up to 44 million pixels. There's so much more. We don't even have time to get into things like a 1080p FaceTime camera, a user configurable VESA mount option, two times wider AVX instructions and even a UHS-II SD card slot. So with all these high-performance technologies and our incredible 5K display, this iMac Pro is going to be an awesome workstation for things like real-time 3D rendering, high frame rate, immersive VR, machine learning development, and with all those cores and all that memory, super fast code compiling. Now speaking of workstations, we wanted to compare the starting configuration of the iMac Pro to what's on the market. And so, if you were to go out and build a comparably spec system today, it will cost over $7000. And keep in mind, that's a system that doesn't have our best in class 5K display. It doesn't have the iMac Pro's incredible all-in-one design. And then obviously doesn't run Mac OS. Well, this is the starting configuration of the iMac Pro and we're going to price it at just $4999. [ Applause ] And it's going to be available in December. So that's a sneak peek at the iMac Pro. It packs workstation class performance into our incredible 27-inch iMac design with its gorgeous 5K display. And it is going to be the most powerful Mac we have ever made. So that is all of our Mac news today. Now, back to Tim. [ Applause and Cheering ] >> Thanks John. All right. So many great things happening with the Mac. And John, I agree that iMac Pro is really badass. All right, next up. Let's talk about iOS. [ Applause and Cheering ] The world's best and most advanced mobile operating system. Our customers love the latest version, iOS 10, which has an industry leading 96% customer satisfaction. And it's absolutely incredible that 86% of our customers are running iOS 10 and taking advantages of its capabilities. This blows away the other platforms that suffer from horrible fragmentation. [ Applause ] With iOS, developers can always target the latest capabilities and features of our latest operating system and be confident that there's customers there for them. Now today, we're going to take the world's best and most advanced mobile operating system and turn it up to 11. [ Applause and Cheering ] And I'd like to invite Craig back to take you through it. Craig? [ Applause ] >> Thank you, Tim. Hello again. Let's talk about iOS 11. It's a big one. Now, we have a big focus on technologies in iOS 11 but also some really big features. We have a lot to talk about. We're going to start with Messages. Now, you all know in iOS 10, we had iMessage apps and stickers. People had a lot of fun with these. And now in iOS 11, we're making them more discoverable and ever with this redesigned app drawer. You can see you have your apps accessible right there at the bottom of the screen with just a tap, you can bring them up, scroll through them and tap into any app. It's really easy. It's going to make it a lot of fun for you to use your apps and stickers. Now, the big story with messages though is messages in iCloud. Because now with your iMessages and iCloud, when you sign in to another new device, well all of your conversations are automatically synchronized. [ Applause ] In fact, they stay in sync. So if you want to delete an embarrassing message that you don't want in your transcript, well it goes away everywhere, which is kind of nice. So, this, of course, allows us to optimize your device storage because with your messages in the cloud, we only need to keep your most recent messages cached on the device and so that makes for smaller and faster backups that is available for iOS and the Mac. And, of course, your messages remain end-to-end encrypted. Next, Apple Pay. So we love using Apple Pay to buy things at retail. In fact, Apple Pay is the number one contactless payment service on mobile devices. And by the end of the year, it will be available in more than 50% of retailers here in the US. Yeah. [ Applause ] But in addition of paying at retail, we use Apple Pay in apps, we use it in the web. There was one final frontier we wanted to conquer and that's Apple Pay for person to person payments. [ Applause and Cheering ] Now, it's super simple because it's integrated right in to messages as an iMessage App. [ Applause and Cheering ] So you can send and receive money right in your transcript. Of course, when you send it, you authenticate securely with Touch ID. And if you receive money with iMessage, it goes to your Apple Pay cash card. And from there, well you can send it on to friends and family, if you are charitable, you can make Apple Pay purchases at retail or on the web. And, of course, you can pull it out and transfer it to your bank. And it's available across all these iOS devices and Apple Watch too. Thank you. [ Applause and Cheering ] So next, let's turn to Siri. Now, Siri is used monthly for more than 375 million devices. It's absolutely huge. And it's available in more languages, in more countries than any other system, 21 languages and 36 countries. So for iOS 11, we're making a big upgrade to your primary interface in dealing with Siri, not Siri's voice. We've used deep learning now to create a really natural and expressive voice for Siri and I'd like you to hear it. >> Here's the forecast for the next 10 days. Sunny, sunny, and sunny. >> Three different ways to say sunny. Very powerful. Now, Siri also has a male voice and it sounds fantastic too. >> I love machine learning especially since I'm a machine, learning. [ Laughter ] >> So, Siri is a great new visual interface as well. And it's able to provide you with followup questions and answers with just a tap and multiple results. When you make a query, it's really handy. Now, Siri also has a new capability, just translation. So, you can now ask something like, how do you say what are the most popular dishes in your restaurant in Chinese? And Siri can say, [ Foreign Language ] Totally. [ Applause ] Now, translation initially will support translation from English to Chinese, French, German, Italian, and Spanish and we'll have more language combinations coming in the months to come. Now, when it comes to using Siri to access your other applications, we have SiriKit. And SiriKit can now do more than ever in iOS 11. So now, you can do task management by using Siri to make tasks and OmniFocus your things, take notes in Evernote, do banking in Citi Mobile or even bring up a QR code in WeChat. Now, Siri isn't just a voice assistant, because with Siri Intelligence, Siri not only understands your voice, it understands the context. It understands your interest. It understands how you use your device. And this allows it to ultimately understand what you want next. Now, we've all experienced this where Siri can help us predict what apps we might want to use next, give us a time to leave notification based on our calendar and where we are, help us respond to a text message. In iOS 11, Siri uses on-device learning to understand more about topics of interest to us. So it can actually suggest topics we might be interested in learning about in news. It can help us respond with our location for getting to an appointment to someone in messages. And even help us make a calendar appointment based on something we've just booked inside of Safari on the web. And what Siri learns about you on device is now kept synced across all of your devices. So you're dealing with one Siri but of course this is kept completely private, readable only by you and your devices. [ Applause ] Next, let's talk about the camera. People love the fantastic cameras in the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. And in fact, our customers now take a trillion photos per year. It's absolutely amazing. And they take a lot of video too. And today, they do it in H.264. But now with our latest iPhones in iOS 7, they get or using HEVC, which is giving us up to two times better compression for camera-captured videos, which means less storage space used on your device and less space used in the cloud. And we're applying these same techniques to replace JPEG capture with what we call HEIF, High Efficiency Image Format. It's based on HEVC and it also provides awesome quality images at half the size on your device. [ Applause and Cheering ] And, of course, you can still share completely compatibly with others. Now, with the iPhone 7 Plus, we love taking these beautiful portrait photos. And now, with iOS 11, we can take low light photographs using optical image stabilization, True Tone Flash, HDR delivers incredible image quality. And we're taking the depth information that we can capture with two cameras and exposing it to developers with a new Depth API which has allowed them to do incredibly fun and artistic photos, like this, using the Depth API. Now, when you're done taking your photos, you go to enjoy them in the Photos app. And one of the ways I love enjoying them is with the Memories feature because Memories is able to scan my library and find all kinds of fun events. And now, it can do more than ever. It uses a machine learning to identify things like sporting events, even weddings, anniversaries, memories of your babies. It's really great. And when you go to play those back, you can see them not just in normal landscape orientation but now watch them in portrait taking full advantage of the height of your display. Now, when it comes to live photos, we have some great enhancements as well. So, you can now trim your live photos, the video around the still. You can mark any part of the video as your key photo and so much more. So, these are some of the big features in the iOS 11. There's one other which is a major redesign, the Control Center. Rather than show in slides, how about we do a demo? [ Applause and Cheering ] All right, let's take our first live look. No, I don't want to do that. Let's take our first live look at iOS 11. Now, I'm going to just bring up Control Center as always and what you'll notice is Control Center is now a single page. It packs all the features into a single page. Now, of course, it has simple switches, I'll just do an orientation lock. It's got a beautiful little animation there for the orientation lock. It has sliders available so you can adjust volume like this. But it provides greater depth because with 3D Touch, 3D Touch on slider like this and get access to more controls. And this allows us to pack lots of capabilities really easily into the design. So you see, we have our wireless control so I could just tap on Airplane Mode. But if I 3D Touch on the platter, I get access to even more features. And this is really great with your music because you can operate them here or jump in for even more information. So it's a really great new Control Center and I think you're really going to love it. [ Applause and Cheering ] Now, we've also taken this opportunity to redesign lock screen and notification center by making them one. So now, when I'm on my lock screen, if I unlock the device, just like that, I can actually now swipe back down. I'm actually on my lock screen seeing those notifications, but I can get at all my other notifications just by scrolling up, like that. It's a really great unification and you still have access, of course, to your widgets on the left and your camera on the right. Now, let's take a look at photos, this beautiful portrait photos but also these great live photos. And, you know, live photos capture a still, but then also a bunch of video automatically captured around it and sometimes the best shot wasn't the still. Well, now, we can go in to Edit Mode, we could trim this video if we want but we also can capture just the frame we want and make that our key photo. [ Applause ] Now, we can do other really fun things with live photos. Now, here is one great shot, this girl blowing a bubble. But would it be greater-- great if she could just keep blowing that bubble? Well, now, she can. We actually use computer vision to compute a seamless loop around this live photo. It's really fun. [ Applause ] And we have another great effect. So here's a fun jump in the pool. But wouldn't it be better if it bounced? There it is. [ Applause ] Now, we can really do some artistic things with live photos as well. So, you see, this is a shot where we have a still landscape but then there's movement in the water. Now, if you wanted to capture this kind of motion, traditionally you'd have to get a tripod and figure out how to configure a long exposure on your high-end camera. But now, you can actually just go into the effects here and select Long Exposure. And check it out. [ Applause ] It's really gorgeous. [ Applause ] Now, let's take a quick look at Memories. Because you see, memories can now capture things like activities, like scuba diving. It can spot your anniversaries, these really touching memories of your children growing up, and most importantly, your pets. Let's play a movie about, you know, these pets. And what we'll see is that we play them of course traditionally here in landscape which is a great way to watch video. And, of course, Memories is using computer vision to actually identify photos of your pet and pick the best scenes. Now, what's great is I can also rotate my phone now into portrait and it automatically reformats to take full advantage of the height of the display. [ Music ] And that's a quick look at Memories. [ Applause ] Now, with Memories, we're using machine learning to help learn more about you and what you're interested in by looking at your photo library. But now in iOS 11, Siri does so much more in learning how you're using your device. So for instance if I'm in Safari here and I'm reading about Iceland, maybe I'm considering taking a trip there. Here's Reykjavik as a nice location. Well, now, Siri actually on my device spots my interest. So when I go let's say into News, Siri automatically surfaces for me a recommendation that I might be interested in news about Iceland. I could just tap in and heart this one like this. And if I tap into a particular article, we can see it mentions certain locations in Iceland. I think this one is called Snaefellsnes. I hope it's OK with anyone who speaks Icelandic. But what's great is now Siri is learning this vocabulary. It knows it might be something I'm going to use in my communication in the future. So when I go into messages and start typing a message and let's say I start typing Reykjavik, well check it out. It learns that Reykjavik is probably a word I might type. And what about-- there it is, Snaefellsnes. [ Applause and Cheering ] Pretty awesome. [ Applause ] Now, let's take a look at stickers. Because you notice now, right on the bottom of the display, we have access to all my sticker packs. I can tap in in the bottom here to my Star Wars sticker pack, I can tap and slide and say select Music. And we now have Apple Pay right here as a messages app. But what's so cool is if I receive a message saying that I owe someone money, well you notice the quick type keyboard automatically surfaces Apple Pay as an option and picks the amount out as what I might want to pay. I can just tap the Pay button, send, and authenticate with my finger print. And just like that, I've paid with Apple Pay. And that is a quick demo of iOS 11. [ Applause and Cheering ] But wait, there is more. It starts with maps. Now, in iOS 10, maps brought beautiful new clarity to navigation. And we're now giving you enhanced information for when you get there to the mall. So, we have detailed floor plans now of malls with place cards, directory and search. And we let you browse by floor. And we're going to be supporting malls and all of these cities out the gate and hundreds more per month thereafter. And we're also bringing the support to major airports. You can see where security is so you can plan. [ Applause ] Now, we'll be supporting all of these airports to start, and again building out more over time. And, of course, we have more improvements to navigation. So now on the upper left, you can even see your speed limit, I hope you're paying attention to that, and lane guidance so you know which lane to be in to make your next move when navigating. [ Applause ] Now, we know in addition to navigation, people like to do more with their phones sometimes while driving. And our safest solution for doing this is CarPlay, lets you keep your eyes on the road while you're doing things like asking Siri to play music. Well, we wanted to bring this same level of safety to everyone who maybe doesn't have one of the 200 models of cars that currently support CarPlay. And we're building on "Do Not Disturb" with a new feature we call "Do Not Disturb While Driving". And it's all about keeping your eyes on the road. When you're driving, you don't need to be responding to these kinds of messages. In fact, you don't need to see them. So now, when you install iOS 11, we're going to use Bluetooth to understand if you're connected to a car. Or even if you don't have Bluetooth, we're going to use WiFi Doppler effect to measure that you're moving in a car. And when you finish that first drive, we're going to suggest, hey how about we activate "Do Not Disturb While Driving". And when we do, instead of seeing all those notifications, we have this new user interface for you. [ Applause ] Now, if you're tempted and you try to turn on your phone, you're actually going to receive this, a little reminder that you're not receiving notifications while you're driving. But, of course, you might be sitting in the back seat in which case, you can tell us, "I'm not driving and you could get through." But what if you are driving and someone sent you a message? Well, they can now get an automatic response saying, "I'll see your message when I get where I'm going." And you can also enable Select People to break through if it's especially urgent. You can have the peace of mind that you can get contacted and they can reply urgent and that message will go through. We think this is going to be a real important step in safety in the car. [ Applause and Cheering ] Next up, HomeKit. So HomeKit provides a secure and private way to automate all of your devices, your home accessories and you can do it right inside the home map and control them here. And also, of course, use your voice with Siri. Now, almost all of the major accessory makers are providing great HomeKit accessories across all of these categories, from security cameras and door locks to lights and fans. But there's one category really close to our heart that we wanted to add to HomeKit. And that's Speakers. [ Applause ] You'll now be able to configure your speakers inside of HomeKit and access them via our new AirPlay 2 protocol. It builds multi-room audio in throughout iOS. [ Applause and Cheering ] So, you can play music to select speakers throughout your home right from the Music app. And with Apple Music, we have a new feature called Shared Up Next. So if you have a friend over and you have a playlist going and maybe your friend wants to contribute to that playlist, well they can do that without interrupting the music. You all compile into that party playlist. Now, the-- all these speaker makers have announced upcoming support for AirPlay 2, but, of course, many of us already own a great AirPlay 2 compatible speaker and those are the ones connected to our Apple TV. Because now, your Apple TV can be played to from your iPhone or iOS device in Mac anywhere in the home. And, of course, if you turn on your Apple TV, it can control playback homewide including using Siri. And we're providing a great developer API, so third party audio apps in iOS can all get in on the multi-room audio fun. Next is Apple Music. Now, last fall, we introduced the all new design for Apple Music which brought greater clarity and simplicity to the Apple Music experience. We now have 27 million customers who are really enjoying the curation as well as the personalization of Apple Music. But, of course, a lot of the way we discover music is to ask one of our friends, "What have you been listening to lately?" So now, in Apple Music, you'll be able to find out right inside the application. [ Applause ] For all the music served up and for you, you'll see indicators if this is the music your friends are listening to and they can configure their profile either to be public or private and control what playlists they share or what are all the music they share they want to make available to their other friends. Now for developers, we're also providing a new API MusicKit for Apple Music. This allows apps full access to the Apple Music service, both on device and from your cloud service. And you can do a tremendous amount with this. Now, Nike has done great exercise playlists using the full Apple Music catalog. With Anchor, anyone can be a DJ using all 40 million songs. And Shazam can automatically add songs to your collection that it identifies. But, you know, one of the biggest stories today for iOS 11 is about the App Store. Now, to give you the big news with the App Store, I'd like to hand it off to Phil Schiller. Thank you. [ Applause and Cheering ] >> Thank you, Craig. Well, good morning everyone. Let's hear it from the way back of the room. Come on. Good morning, everyone. [ Cheering ] Yes. I am so excited to be able to talk to you this morning about the App Store. The App Store is turning nine years old and it is going so well. There are 500 million weekly visitors to the App Store who come to see your amazing apps and to download them. They have now downloaded over 180 billion apps to date. That's incredible. That does not include auto re-downloads and updates. Amazing. And just recently, we passed $70 billion paid out to developers today. [ Applause and Cheering ] Yes. Thirty percent of that in the last year alone, the apps are incredible. And customers are doing things with them that none of us have ever imagined. Like this. These are people in Hong Kong playing Pokemon Go. Pokemon Go is from Niantic. It was one of the big hits from last year and there have been a lot of big hits last year from big developers and indie developers alike. And together, the developers at Apple, we've made this the best app platform in the world. So thank you. [ Applause ] Yes. Thank you for the incredible apps you make that we and our customers all love. It's not by chance that the App Store has become such a great place. From the beginning, we've had two very important goals, to make the App Store a trusted and safe place for users and to make it a great opportunity for all developers. We continue to work really hard at that. Over the last year, the team has done a lot of great things to make the App Store an even better store for all of us. There's many things we can talk about but I think one stands head and shoulders above the rest, faster app review times. [ Applause ] Yes. I'm sure you're well aware that the majority of apps are all now reviewed in under 24 hours, many in just one to two hours. The team is going to keep working hard at that. And we have a lot more coming for the remainder of the year. I've highlighted a bunch of things here. I'll just point out one of them. You can read some of your favorite things up there. A big request in developers is called phased releases. Now when you-- >> Woo! >> Yes, woo for phased releases, come on. Phased releases means, when you submit an app, you can choose if you want it to be phased over time so it doesn't hit your infrastructure all at once and you can see how customers are responding to that update. So it's really great feature for you to take advantage of. And there are a lot of things coming this year but there is one that is incredibly gigantic. And that is we're going to do something that we've never done before in the nine years of the App Store. We're going to completely redesign it, a brand new App Store. [ Applause ] It is absolutely beautiful. [ Applause ] The App Store starts with a brand new tab called Today. Did you remember back the first time you started downloading apps when you use the App Store and it was so much fun to go in every single day and discover the new apps that were appearing? I mean, that's an amazing feeling. And we're bringing that back again with this brand new tab called Today, a whole new way to discover apps. It's a place where we can feature the apps we all love and the stories about the developers who created them. It's going to be such a great place for customers to discover your apps every single day. There's another new tab, Games. Games, the biggest area of the App Store has its own dedicated space now. So for all of us who loves gaming and finding the best featured games of the day and seeing charts about gaming, this is now a place to go to experience all that's happening with games. And not only can we feature games, but for the first time in the App Store, we can feature in-app purchases as well. A big part of your business is now there in the App Store so the next time you have a brand new level, you have a brand new character, customers can see them right in the App Store and click on them and start the process to get them right away. And since Games have their own tab, now Apps have their own tab. This is everything that we love about apps besides games with dedicated features and charts all there for customers to enjoy. And every app and every game, of course, has its own product page in the store. These are more beautiful than ever, more engaging with incredible videos. You're going to love all the features on your product pages and there're sessions here at WWDC to learn how to take advantage of all those great new app page features. These are just some of the new things in the all new App Store, the new Today tab, new Games tab, new Apps tab. And we'd love to show it to you live for the very first time. So please welcome Ann Thai, Product Marketing Manager for the App Store to the stage. Ann. [ Applause and Cheering ] >> Thanks Phil. I'm so excited to show you the new App Store. So let's get to it. I'm going to open the store and I land right here on the Today tab, the new front of the App Store that updates every day. The first thing I see is our top story, the world premiere of Monument Valley 2 is finally here. [ Applause and Cheering ] Let's check it out by tapping on the card. This opens a story view where we can learn more about the game and what makes it so great. It looks like this is going to be even more beautiful than the first. I can watch videos that show me what the game play is like. And here's a cool quote from Dan Gray at Ustwo Games about what inspired them. I can share the story with a friend and what's incredible is that we can actually all download this today, only on the App Store. [ Applause ] Let's see what else is happening today. What have we got here? Here's a how to guide about VSCO. I use this app all the time. Let's check it out. This is packed full of useful tips. So even if you have an app already, you still might learn something new like I didn't know you could use it to make animated GIFs or GIFs. Anyway, you can make them. I just scroll back up and pull down on the card and I'm back in the feed. Every day there's a new app of the day and a new game of the day and the daily list. These are great because they're focused on a theme or a goal like meditation. I've actually been trying some of these out to get ready for this and it's totally working. If I'm busy and miss a day, I can scroll down and see stories from earlier in the week. So that's the Today tab. If I only want to see games, now I can go to the New Games tab. This is huge. Let's check it out. Up at the top I can see the biggest new releases or just what the game editors are playing this week. If I scroll down I can watch a whole bunch of game videos. And it's not just previews but also tips and gameplay videos by editors too. If I scroll down, I can see charts that only feature games. So it's really easy to see what the most popular games are separate from apps. And now I can browse by game categories too. This page is just packed full of recommendations. This artsy game looks fun. Let's check it out. I'm going to tap on the icon and it opens up a redesigned app page. It's more beautiful and more useful. I can watch more videos that show me how fun this is. And this badge at the top tells me it was named editor's choice. If I scroll down, I can see ratings and reviews front and center so I can see what other customers think before making a choice. Like this review, it tells me this game is great for killing time. Thanks, FuriousPotatoFace. For all the incredible apps on the store there's a new tab too, the Apps tab. Let's go there. It shares the same great design as the Games tab but with a focus just on apps. So that was just the first day on the new App Store. Now you can see why we're so excited to have a beautiful new place to share apps and games we love with you. Back to you, Phil. [ Applause ] >> Thank you, Ann. So that's your first glimpse of an entirely new App Store. We hope you love it. We hope customers love it and visit it every single day to download your incredible apps. And that's it for the App Store. Back to you, Craig. [ Applause ] >> Thank you, Phil. The App Store looks just fantastic. So those are some of the big features in iOS 11. But of course, there's also core technologies. Now, Metal 2 and HEVC coming to iOS as well, but there's more and it starts with machine learning. Now, you've seen the way we've used machine leaning throughout the experiences on Apple Watch, for instance, and the predictive Siri watch face. We use it on the iPad for palm rejection when you're writing with Apple Pencil. Of course, we use it to extend your battery life by predicting how you're going to use your device. And you've seen it throughout photos with memories and face recognition. Well now, for all of you developers, we want to make powerful machine learning easy for you to incorporate in your apps. And we're doing it via set of new APIs. Starts with the vision API which provides face tracking, face detection, landmarks, all of these core features we use inside of our apps. And the natural language API that provides capabilities like tokenization and named entity recognition. Now, these are all built on Core ML. And Core ML provides high performance implementations of deep neural networks, recurrent neural networks, convolution neural networks, support vector machines. And they allow you to take models that you've built with any of these popular third party tools. And using our machine leaning model converter, execute them with tremendous performance on device to give you all the data privacy benefits and all of the carefully tuned compatibility with all of our platforms, and the performance really is incredible. You look at this benchmark called Inception v3. It's a popular photo recognition benchmark. iPhone is six times faster than Google Pixel and the Samsung S8 using Core ML. [ Applause ] Next, I'd like to turn to AR. Now, with Multi-Touch, it really changed the way that you interact with the world on the screen of your iPhone. And with the camera, it allowed you to capture the world around you. But when you bring these things together, the results can actually be quite profound. Now it's called the augmented reality and we have a new core technology called ARKit to bring it to all of you. And I'd like to show it to you in a demo now. [ Applause ] So, we've all seen a lot of carefully edited vision videos on this topic recently, but in this case I'd like to show you something for real. So, what we see here is an iPhone that's-- look, using its camera but using computer vision it's actually able to identify surfaces such as this table and I can actually just add an object. This is a developer application, a test application that you'll all be getting code for that allows you to do these things. Now, this is a virtual object on this table. Now-- [ Applause ] Get some steam in there coming off the cup. Now I can add other objects to the scene and these things can actually interact. Let's add a lamp and I want you to watch when I turn the lamp up on the dynamic shadows here. I'm going to move the cup and watch how the shadow moves in relationship to the light here. It's really pretty incredible. Now, I can add additional objects. Let's add a vase to the scene. I mean, isn't that just incredible? Well, you guys are actually in the shot here with these objects all in augment reality. So it gives you a little bit of an idea of the technology involved. It's really pretty incredible. Now, how do we do it? [ Applause ] Well, ARKit provides fast and stable motion tracking and it uses all of the sensors and the camera in your device to do this. It actually finds planes like floors and tables. It's able to estimate ambient light which helps us with the rendering and also helps with scale. You notice that cup hit the table looking the size of a cup, not the size of an elephant. And we've brought integration to all kinds of third party frameworks to help you with your rendering. The implementation is possible because we're able to take advantage of the awesome hardware in iOS devices, the cameras, the high performance CPU and GPU, and the motion sensors. And when you bring the software together with these devices, we actually have hundreds of millions of iPhones and iPads that are going to be capable of AR. And, in fact, that's going to make overnight ARKit the largest AR platform in the world. [ Applause ] We've had some third parties in to take a look at ARKit and they are totally excited and we are just blown away by what they've been able to accomplish. IKEA, of course, is placing furniture everywhere and it's really super awesome, but check this out. What you can do with Batman Lego, I mean how fun is this? Right on the table a Lego with a live-- Lego Batman, and you can explode the Lego like you can never do in the real world, pan around it and interact with Batman right there. It's really awesome. And then Pokemon GO, we've all seen it before but check it out with ARKit. The Pokemon is so real, he's right there on the ground. As the ball bounces, it actually bounces right there in the real environment. It's AR like you've never seen it before. Now-- [ Applause ] There's one of these that I think you just really need to see, see live. Now, Wingnut AR is Director Peter Jackson's new production company. It's dedicated to producing AR content. We all know Peter Jackson from his incredible cinematic work on movies like The Lord of the Rings series. But he's now really excited about AR. And to show you what he has in the works, I'm thrilled to introduce Wingnut AR's creative director, Alasdair Coull. Alasdair. [ Applause ] >> Thanks, Craig. We're really excited to share an exclusive sneak peek of something we've been working on. With the ARKit, you don't need any special equipment or tracking markers, it just works. Dan is here with me for Wingnut AR, so let's take a look. Here we're using ARKit to detect the plane of the table, estimate its size and lock our content on the surface. And since this is augmented reality, you folks are all in the shop table. [ Applause ] This is all rendered in real-time using the power of Unreal Engine 4. We're in a remote air post in a desolate world where supplies are scarce. Airships come here to refuel, get repairs and to trade. These are our townsfolk. They're expecting some visitors soon so they're all starting to get ready for their arrival. Except for this guy down here apparently. Who hired him? [ Sound Effects ] That's our airships arriving now. And what's really cool here is that with the ARKit's tracking, you can get on really close and choose how to view the action. It's like you're the director of your own experience. Looks like some raiders are attacking. [ Sound Effects ] [ Gunshots ] [ Music and Noise ] Oh, I guess that takes care of that guy. [ Music and Noise ] Wouldn't it be cool to have airship battles like this in your own living room? Oh, I think they're going to regret attacking this air post. [ Music and Noise ] And another one down. And we got him. Oh, geez. Well, that didn't end well for anyone. But our heroes are limping away to fight another day. So that's one of the things we've been up to, Wingnut AR. And the fact that ARKit-- Thank you. [ Applause and Cheering ] Thank you. [ Applause ] The fact that ARKit enables hundreds and millions of people to enjoy experiences like this opens up so many possibilities. I think it's a real game changer. Look out for an AR experience from us in the App Store later this year. Thank you. [ Applause ] >> So what do you think? [ Applause and Cheering ] So those are some of the major features in iOS 11. Of course, there's much more than we have time to talk about today, but I want to highlight some features of special interest to our customers in China, like QR codes that are integrated right into the main camera, accessible from the lock screen, super use-- Yes, super useful for customers in China. So that's our update for iOS 11. I'm going to turn it back to Tim. Thank you. [ Applause and Cheering ] >> That's right. [ Applause and Cheering ] iOS 11 is absolutely jam-packed with great features and I can't wait for you to get your hands on the new App Store and ARKit. Number five. An important part of the iOS story is, of course, iPad. [ Applause and Cheering ] iPad has completely changed the way we work, play, teach, learn and create. It's truly a magical piece of glass that transforms into anything you want. We've been pushing the boundaries on iPad. And today, we're going to push them further than ever before. And to tell you all about it, I'd like to invite up Joz. Joz [ Applause and Cheering ] >> Thank you, Tim. And good morning, everybody. I'm so excited to talk to you today about iPad Pro. When we first introduced iPad Pro just 18 months ago, it completely redefined what you could do with your iPad. Along with your incredible apps, it allowed our users to do really amazing things, from professional design and illustration to fashion, to architecture, to engineering and so much more. We're really excited about what can be real in your world today with iPad Pro. Well, as you know, there's two models to iPad Pro today. There's a 13-inch and a 9.7-inch. And the 9.7-inch is our most popular model. It has a screen large enough to get your work done, but it's in a thin and light enough package that allows you to take it with you everywhere you go. Well, today, we're going to introduce an all new iPad Pro. It's going to take everything you love about the 9.7-inch and give you a whole lot more to love. Let's take a look. This is the new iPad Pro. [ Applause and Cheering ] It's the first iPad Pro with a larger 10 and a half inch Retina display. Now, why 10 and a half inch? Well, for one, it's a lot larger. It's 20% larger than a 9.7-inch. But we are able to reduce the borders by nearly 40% which allows us to submit it in this incredibly compact design that still weighs just one pound. And of course, 10.5-inch also allows us to do some other things. It's the perfect size to allow us to display a full-size on-screen keyboard. [ Applause and Cheering ] It's also the perfect size to allow us to have a full-size Smart keyboard as well. And when we deliver the Smart keyboard, we're going to have support for more than 30 languages at launch including Chinese, and for the very first time, a Japanese JIS keyboard. [ Applause ] Now, iPad Pro has always had the best displays in the industry. And both sizes are going to get really incredible new displays today. They're the best displays that we've ever made. They're packed with incredible features like True Tone for automatic white balance, P3 wide color gamut for the best color, ultralow reflectivity, the best in the industry. And they're 50% brighter with 600 nits. And this extra brightness and the P3 wide color gamut means that with iOS 11, you'll be able to display HDR video for the first time in an iPad for really immersive cinematic experience. They're truly awesome displays. But our biggest breakthrough is a feature we call ProMotion. So what is ProMotion? Well, we were able to take our unique hardware and software capabilities and dramatically improve our display performance. Now, typically, up until today, mobile displays have refresh at 60 hertz, means they update the content 60 times every second. Well, on the new iPad Pro, we've doubled that maximum refresh rate to an incredible 120 hertz. [ Applause ] So what does that mean to you? It means that all of your motion content on your screen is going to be smoother, crisper, more responsive. Now, this is something you have to really touch and feel yourself to appreciate because our projection systems just aren't capable of doing those type of refresh rates. But I'll tell you the difference is dramatic. And when you scroll, it's buttery smooth. Now, the higher refresh rate also means it works even better with the Apple Pencil. We already have the industry-leading performance for drawing and writing with the Apple Pencil, but with ProMotion, it gets even better. It's more responsive and it reduces our latency to an industry best 20 milliseconds. [ Applause ] So drawing is incredibly fluid and even more natural, you're going to love using the Apple Pencil of the new iPad Pro. Another breakthrough of ProMotion is that these become the first mobile displays to be able to dynamically adjust the refresh rate, depending on what you're looking at. This is a really big breakthrough for both display quality, as well as for power savings. So when you have dash-moving content, they can update quickly. But they can also update slower when you don't need that type of refresh rate. For example, a still image, this allows us to save a lot of energy and give you better battery life. So, hopefully you see why these are not just the best displays that we've ever made, but we think they're the most advanced displays in the planet. Next, let's talk about performance. iPad is already best in class for performance. But we're not resting on our laurels. These are the fastest we've ever created. Inside them, they're powered by the A10X Fusion chip. The A10X has a six-core CPU, three high-performance cores, three high-efficiency cores, all automatically managed by the Apple performance controller. It also has a 12-core GPU. This is a powerhouse. And it delivers 30% faster CPU performance over our already industry leading A9X and 40% faster graphics performance. [ Applause ] Our chip team has done just an amazing job over the years with the performance improvements and results have been staggering. They're delivering an industry-leading graphics performance that's more than 500 times the original iPad from just a few years ago. But of course, numbers only tell part of the story. To demonstrate the real-world performance of the A10X in the new iPad Pro, I'd like to invite Ash Hewson of Serif to give you a demo of their new Pro photo editing app called Affinity Photo. Ash. [ Applause ] >> Thanks, Joz. So I'm thrilled today to be able to show you the iPad version of Affinity Photo. This is a truly high-end professional photo editing tool. And on this latest iPad Pro, we can achieve levels of performance which is simply unattainable on any other device. And I'm going to try and show you that today by creating a movie poster. I've already set up a few layers. I've kind of got this great background of some stormy sky. I've got a turbulent sea and this ship. Now, the first thing you'll notice when you're using this is as you're kind of moving layers around, rotating them or even just sort of panning and zooming around your work, I'm seeing all of these now at 120 frames a second. So it just feels incredibly smooth. But when you come to edit layers, because of Metal, we can achieve performance more than four times than i7 quad core desktop PC. And I'll show you what that means. On this sea, I'm going to apply a 12 filter. And look, just with my finger, I can kind of push this sea around, or I can even just like flick away right over the side of the ship. It's a totally new way to kind of interact with your designs. And actually, everything is this fast. So let's-- So I wanted to set this ship on fire, for example. I've got this fire up all here. I can move this over the back of the ship. But to make that look more realistic, I need to apply blend mode. Now normally, blend modes is something that takes a lot of trial and error. But now, look at this. So I can just scrub down here and I'll get an instant preview of all the different blend modes. So it makes it really, really easy to select the right blend modes that I want. Now of course, everything I've done so far, I've done using touch. But with iPad Pro, we have the best stylus that's ever been made. And we can do some great stuff with Apple Pencil, too. A really good example of that is our lighting filter. So here, I'll choose lighting, and make that a bit bigger. And look, I can actually control now the angle and the tilt of that light using Apple Pencil. There's no latency, whatsoever. So it's a really immersive way to work. Now, I said at the start, I was creating a movie poster. And in fact, what I'm actually doing is creating a pirate movie poster. So now, I need a pirate. And I've got Captain Jack Sparrow here. But at the moment, of course, he's on the wrong background. So what I need to do is cut him out. And I'm going to use some selection tool to do that. So, to start with, I'm just going to do-- and you can see how quick it is to do a really quick selection with pencil to sort of snap around the edges. But of course, with selections, what often happens is you need to do a much more accurate selection around hair. And to do that, we're going to do a selection refinement. This is something that takes a huge amount of CPU power, but on this latest iPad, it's twice as fast as ever before. And you can see pretty much instantly, I'll get a selection down to individual strands of hair. [ Applause ] And that's it, that's my poster complete, a professional looking poster created on a device that I can hold in my hands. It's really incredible. I really think that iPad Pro, alongside Affinity Photo, is a truly game-changing experience for professional photo editing. And the best thing of all is that you can now experience it now, because I'm delighted to announce that Affinity Photo for iPad is available on the App Store from today. Thank you. [ Applause and Cheering ] >> Wow. Thank you, Ash. That's amazing performance, again, especially for a device that's so thin and light in a simple one-pound package you could take with you everywhere you go. And what's also cool is despite all this performance to new, iPad Pro still delivers the same all day 10-hour battery life that our iPad users love. Next, let's talk about cameras. The new iPad Pro features the latest camera system from our iPhone 7. That means the same high performance 12 megapixel sensor with optical image stabilization. And it has the ability to even capture and, of course, edit 4K video on the go. They're absolutely fantastic cameras. The front-facing cameras from the iPhone 7 as well got all these great features, like wide color gamut capture, auto image stabilization and the entire display can light up to become the world's brightest and largest Retina flash. We have great accessories as well. The iPad Pro supports USB 3, which means that you're going to get faster transfers with your USB and SD camera adapters. And this also-- We also support fast charging, means any of our USB-C charge adapters will now allow you to charge at half the time. And we have great new Smart covers we have available in polyurethane and then we're bringing back the popular leather as well. And then we've designed an all new leather sleeve with a built-in storage for your Apple Pencil. So that's the new iPad Pro family, a line-up with the world's most advanced displays including a brand new 10 and a half inch size and incredibly compact design, powerful new A10X Fusion chip, incredible new cameras. And of course as you would expect, we make all this in incredibly environmentally friendly ways. We're also going to double the amount of memory that comes at the beginning of these configurations. Both sizes will now start with 64 gigabytes of memory. [ Applause ] And the 10 and a half inch with 64 gigs will now be at $649 and it's just $150 more to move up to the bigger display at $799. We're also going to have configurations in 256 and 512 gigabytes, half a terabyte of storage in an iPad. And as always, you can get any of these models with LTE as well. So this is the new iPad Pro. You can order them today. They'll start shipping next week. And of course because they're shipping now, they're going to ship with iOS 10 but you'll be able to easily update to iOS 11 as a free update this fall. But you haven't heard the full iOS 11 story yet as relates to iPad. So I'd like to invite Craig back to the stage to tell you about some incredible iPad features coming on iOS 11. >> Thank you. Hey, everybody. [ Applause ] Yes, there is more iOS 11. If you love iPad like I do, well, buckle up for -- You're in for a wild ride. We are taking iOS to the next level. This is the largest iOS release for iPad we've ever done. Now, it starts with the dock. Now we all know that dock hovering down there at the bottom of the screen, it is more powerful than ever. You can fill it with apps. On the right there's a predictive area, figures out what you're going to use next including your continuity apps. And now you can summon the dock from anywhere right from the bottom of the screen and use it for switching apps just like that. And what's incredible is how it's used for multitasking. So now if you're in an app and you swipe up, we can pull an app out just like that into Slide Over. [ Applause and Cheering ] Now of course you can snap your apps into Split View, but what's really cool is the new app switcher, because it preserves all of your spaces with your app pairings. It's really great. Now, the iPad of course is the ultimate multi-handed, multi-touch device and so we're so excited to bring drag and drop to iPad. [ Applause and Cheering ] You can drag images, you can drag text, you can drag URLs, you can multi-select and multi-hand drag, it's a drag fast. Now, it's incredibly productive. But of course sometimes you have to type and so we made the keyboard even more productive as well. You can now flick on keys to access punctuation and numbers all without switching planes. It's super fast and super easy. [ Applause ] Now, we have a new app to introduce to you today, and it's called Files. [ Applause ] Files brings together all your files in your iPad. It supports everything you'd expect, nested folders, spring-loading, list view, favorites, search, tags and it has this beautiful Recents view that pulls it all together across all of your sources. Because it supports not only iCloud, it also supports third party storage providers like Box, Dropbox, OneDrive and Google Drive. And they're all right here in your sidebar. You know what, let's do a demo. >> All right. [ Applause ] Let's take our first look at iOS 11 on iPad. So here we have our new dock at the bottom. Now I can easily drag right into the dock just like this. It's a great way to launch apps as always. But now it's also a great way to switch apps. Just tap like that. Now, if I want to multitask, check this out, drag it out, it's right there. Now I can slide it off the screen. I can now slide it over here. Both these views are completely live. I can go into Split View just like this. But I want you to check out the new app switcher. I'm just going to swipe for up from the bottom and keep swiping, goes back like that. Let's do that again, that is so great. It's that easy. [ Applause and Cheering ] Now you notice my spaces are preserved. So over here on the left I have mail in Safari. In Split View I can just tap those open like this. Let's try some drag and drop. So I'm going to drag the URL from the top of Safari here right into this mail message. Drag it and drop it. Now I can drag it, yup. Let's drag an image. Yup, just like that. Now, I want to focus just on mail, because I'm going to show you dragging across spaces. So let's go in to Photos. I have some great photos here of some potential drone protection options for the new campus. So I'm going to start to drag. But watch this, with my other hand I'm going to tap. I can add to this selection just like that. And I can even swipe up with my other hand in the multitasking, move over to mail and drop. [ Applause ] Now I want to show you files. I can bring up files of course right from the dock and Split View just like this. And it's a great way to deal with attachments because I can take this attachment and this mail message, pick it up and just drop it right into this folder of top secret projects. [ Applause ] Now let's dive all the way in and take a closer look at the Files app. We see it has this gorgeous grid view but it also has a list view that provides me all the details about my files. I can sort them by size or let's sort by date. Now I can create new folders. So let's say I want to create an R&D folder right here. I'm going to take some of my top secret perspective projects and I can do multi-select just like this, drop them in. Now I can also take the folder, drag it right in to my Favorites. And these are synced across all of my devices. And if I want to tag a file, of course I just drag it right on there and make that one important. And you notice in addition to iCloud here on the left, I have access to all my cloud providers like Box, so you can see I have files here I'm using and folders that I'm using for collaboration. And that includes this drone defense proposal right here, presentation. And I want to show you when I go into the Recents view from the tab at the bottom, notice again I view across everything including that one inside the Box. I'm going to tap into that keynote presentation and for my final act, I want to show you how I can use files directly from the dock, just swipe up. If I tap and hold, I get access to my recent assets. I can just pick this up, drop it down just like that. And that is a quick demo of our productivity features on iPad. [ Applause and Cheering ] Now, next I want to talk about Apple Pencil, because Apple Pencil has really created a whole new way of working on iPad. And with iOS 11, we've integrated it deeply into the system. Now it starts with markup, because you can mark up anything you can Quick Look. You can take Safari content, recreate it into a continuous scrolling view that you can mark up. And you can actually do this with any app that supports printing, because we have a create PDF option that will create a markup PDF, it's a really great way to mark up anything and share it. We know, a lot of people do like to share with screenshots, and so now when you take a screenshot, we'll create a thumbnail down in the bottom of the screen. If you tap it, you go instantly in the markup, you can mark it up right there and share it. Now, we've all-- It's really cool. [ Applause ] Now, we've also integrated Pencil deeply into Notes. So if you're working on a note and later you're at the lock screen, you want to get back, just a tap of the pencil to lock screen and your right back into your note. And we've made your note handwritten text searchable. So we can now search handwriting and we use deep learning to recognize what you write. And if you're doing primarily typed notes, you can now also do inline drawings, right there. It's very handy. [ Applause ] Now of course, sometimes we still have to deal with paper, so Notes now has a built-in document scanner. It can correct perspective and contrast. And when you bring the note in, you can mark it up, write with your pencil. [ Applause ] And we've integrated markup in the mail as well so you can personalize your mail messages with the inline drawings. Now, for a look at all of these great new Pencil features, I'd like to introduce the man who heads iPad software engineering for us, Toby Paterson, for a live demo. Toby. [ Applause and Cheering ] >> Good morning. [ Applause ] Well, the first thing I want to show you is a quick way of getting to your notes using your Apple Pencil. You just tap on the lock screen like this and it slides up to reveal your notes beneath it. Now you can see here I've got a handwritten note and I want to show you how easy it is to create one of these. Watch at the top of the note here as I edit the title. Just by putting the pencil down and writing like this, after the 2017 keynote. It's as natural as putting pencil to paper. Now something paper can't help you with is finding your notes again later. We're using machine learning to recognize your handwriting and index it in Spotlight. Let's switch into Spotlight now and we'll search for that text that I just wrote down. You can see here I've got the new flick keyboard which makes it really easy to enter numbers just by swiping down on the keys like this. And you can see there it's already found my note as the top hit even with my atrocious handwriting. We'll just tap on that and we're back with the note. [ Applause ] Now, I'm going to switch to a different note now, because I want to show you how you can mix drawing with typed text and tables and all of the notes' other great features. This is a note that my young daughter shared with me as part of a school assignment where she had to work with her parents to develop an idea for a new app. Now, she asked me how many copies of our app I thought I might sell-- We might sell. And so, I want to quickly draw a graph to give her some idea of that. I'm just going to press down here with the pencil to make some space for my drawing and then we can take that little grabber and open up some more room. Now, I am really bad at drawing but I just love doing it. And what's great about drawing on the iPad is it works the same way as it does with paper. And that means it's really easy for me to draw really badly right here. Watch. I'm just going to put the pencil down and just like that, zoom. It's so simple, and I think you're going to have a lot of fun rediscovering the joy of drawing. But let's move on now. So, my daughter's learned a few things from me about how Apple works. And before I left this morning, she gave me an NDA to sign. I'm going to use the new document scanner notes and my pencil to take care of that in a snap. We'll just tap the plus button here to bring up the document scanner and all I need to do is point the camera at the piece of paper. Notes will take the picture automatically, even straighten the page up. We'll open it up full screen here and I just fill in the blanks with my pencil. And just like that, I've got a signed copy of the NDA saved away in my notes. Now I see my daughter sent me a message and it must be pretty important if she's interrupting my demo. So if you'll excuse me, I'm just going to tap on that and see what she has to say. Wow, an offer for $100 million is really pretty thrilling. I need to send this to my wife right away. I'm going to take a screenshot of this and then we'll tap on the thumbnail here to open up our new screenshot editing UI. From here, I can crop it down to just the part of the image that I want to send. I can scribble a quick note with my pencil, and then I can bring up the share sheet to send it off to my wife right away. So these are just a few of the ways you can use your pencil with your iPad in iOS 11. Back to you now, Craig. Thank you. [ Applause and Cheering ] >> It is so great when your grade school child gets $100 million of funding. They just-- They do grow up so fast these days. Well, so these are some of the great new features for the iPad and of course they're joined by all of these other features you heard from earlier today. We're really excited about what we're doing with iPad this year, and really excited about iOS 11. Now iOS 11 is available to all of you, developers, today. And if you sign up at beta.apple.com, you can get a beta at the end of the month and we're making it available as a free upgrade to everyone in the fall, supports all of these devices. That is your update for iOS 11. I'm going to turn it back over to Tim. Thank you. [ Applause and Cheering ] >> That's right. [ Applause ] Thank you. iOS 11 really takes iPad to a whole new level. People are going to be able to do more in more places than ever before. We are so excited about the marriage of iOS 11 and the new iPad Pro that we made a video and I'd love to run it for you. [ Alarm Ringing ] [ Music ] [ Applause ] I hope you're as excited about the new iPad Pro and iOS 11 as we are. Now, we've got one last thing to talk to you about. Let's turn our attention to music. Music has always been a part of Apple's DNA. We first revolutionized the music industry with iTunes. Then we forever changed the way people listen to music on the go with the iPod. And today, iPhone has become the best portable music player in the world and it's even better when it's paired with Apple Music. You now have 40 million songs in your pocket. And when you add AirPods, it brings an absolutely magical experience to wireless audio. Now, so we have such a great portable music experience. But what about our homes? We think we can do a lot to make this experience much better. Just like we did with portable music, we want to reinvent home music. And I'd like to invite Phil up to tell you all about it. Phil. [ Applause and Cheering ] >> Thank you. [ Applause and Cheering ] This is really exciting, the chance to reinvent the way we enjoy music in the home. I can't think of anything that matters more to so many of us. Why hasn't this happened yet? There certainly are a lot of companies hard at work making products to enjoy music in our home. But none of them have quite nailed it yet. Some have worked hard to make wireless music sound good around our homes, but these aren't smart speakers. Others have worked to make smart speakers that you can talk to, but they don't sound so great when you listen to music. We want to combine all these in a product that can really deliver a breakthrough experience. And our team has been hard at work for many years now on a breakthrough home speaker. And it has to do a few things really great if it's going to be a great breakthrough speaker. First, it needs to rock the house, right? We need to enjoy our music, whatever genre you love, really low or really loud, free from distortion. Second, it needs to be spatially aware. It's going to fit in different rooms in our house and it needs to be smart enough to know what to do to make the music sound great. Third, it has to be really fun to use. It has to have a built-in musicologist, an expert on music who can help us to hear the music we love or discover music we're going to love. Now we're working on this speaker for later this year, but we want to give you, 6000 of our closest friends, a sneak peek at it this morning. And here it is. [ Music ] [ Applause and Cheering ] It is absolutely beautiful and we call it HomePod. Yes. [ Applause and Cheering ] Just like iPod reinvented music in our pockets, HomePod is going to reinvent music in our homes. So let's talk about these features. First, rock the house. The HomePod is just under 7 inches tall. It's covered in a seamless 3D mesh fabric that has incredible acoustic properties, and it hides within it amazing audio technology. For example, along the bottom is a 7 array beam-formed tweeter pack that's packed with seven tweeters, each with their own individual driver. They're precision acoustic horns that drive the audio from within and then out along the bottom with tremendous directional control. And that will become really clear in a bit as we talk about how it works. It has a really big woofer, 4-inch woofer upward facing with a large motor to move a lot of air. It has automatic bass equalization and dynamic software modeling so that as we turn the volume up, it's free from distortion. And all of this is controlled by an Apple A8 chip. Yes, the same chip that powers the inside of our iPhone is inside HomePod. It's perhaps the biggest brain ever in a speaker, and it does some incredible things. [ Applause and Cheering ] It has real-time acoustic modeling, audio beam-forming, and multi-channel echo cancellation. You don't have to know any of that, is just know that it sounds incredible. Next, we talk about this spatial awareness. Well, what does that mean? Well, you plug in your HomePod to AC and it gets its music wirelessly. And it's compact enough that you can put it mostly anywhere in your house. You can put it on a table, on a shelf, against the wall, in a corner and it intelligently and automatically detects the spaces within. And it uses that information to adjust the audio, to balance it, and take full advantage of the environment and create a very spacious sound. Now, we want to give you a sense of what that experience is like. So we want to play some music in this room and show you a visual simulation to give you an understanding of some of the technologies it's using and how it's adopting them to make incredible sound, on this compact speaker. So I'm going to start by playing an audio track and it will be a full mix and then I'm going to break it down to some of the components that the HomePod controls. [ Music ] So that's a full rich audio mix but within it, HomePod detects the center vocals and can use beam-forming to direct that. [ Music ] It gives incredible clarity and precision. And then it can detect something called direct energy with the instrumentation and direct that in the room as well. [ Music ] In addition to that direct energy, there's something that's usually missing in music, ambient audio, the backing vocals and reverb. [ Music ] HomePod can direct all of these and pull it together to a full rich mix that fills up your room. [ Music ] [ Applause and Cheering ] It's a really remarkable experience to hear this kind of a spacious sound come from such a compact speaker. And if you love one, you should see what it's like when you set up two and they automatically work together to give this incredible spacious sound that really has the power to rock your house. Next, a musicologist. This intelligent helper to help us discover the music we love. HomePod has an incredible speaker system that works together with our Apple Music subscription. From the beginning, it's designed to work with that. Now, Apple Music as you know provides music in the cloud and if the speaker can get it directly from the cloud, it can get 40 million tracks, two million artists, tens of thousands of playlists. But not just any music library, this is your music library. It knows the playlists you've set up, it knows the artist you love and all of them stream directly to your HomePod. It works with an array of six microphones around the middle, so as you talk to it and you say those magic words, "Hey Siri," you see a waveform light up on top and now it can respond to your commands and help serve up the music you want to hear. The Siri team has worked very hard to adapt the domain of music in Siri to be even greater and understand more of the questions we're going to ask about music. Simple things obviously like Play Beats 1 Radio. We all want to do that. Or play "I'm Poppy". Check it out if you don't know what that's about. Play something new. Who's singing on this track? Something I ask all the time. Who's playing drums on this track? To complex questions like, what was the top song on May 5th, 2016. You just play more like that or I like that song. It's a free form. Siri doesn't need a specific list of commands. It can interpret what you're saying and help you discover the music you love. And even better, you don't have to just sit next to the HomePod to talk to it. It can be across the room and speak to the HomePod even while loud music is playing and the speaker array and the microphones can pick it up and hear what you're saying. So HomePod, it has the power to rock the house in a spatial awareness so that it understands the rooms we place it within. And it has the fun interactivity of Siri becoming a musicologist and helping us to listen to the music we love. And since Siri is built in there and you can speak to it, well, the team has also worked hard to make it a great and helpful home assistant as well. We said the domain of music is something Siri knows really well in HomePod. There are other domains as well. We've worked hard to pick the first ones that we think matter most in a product like HomePod, so of course, it can play your podcasts. But it can also do things like give you news, give you weather, traffic, sports. You can ask it to set a reminder, set a timer, text someone with messages. And if you have HomeKit devices set up in your home, you can speak to your HomePod and control your HomeKit devices. So for example, for the HomePod set up, you can say, "When do the Red Sox play next?" They're going to beat the Yankees, trust me. Tune to NPR instead, flip a coin, remind me to bring snacks to a party. You can set up reminders, check all the sports news and weather, all directly with your voice, talk to a HomePod that gets the information directly from the cloud. And if you have HomeKit devices set up, you can say simple things like, are the lights on, turn the heat up, turn on the air conditioning, bring the shades down halfway, turn off the lights in the bedroom. And if you've set up scenes in HomeKit you can control those as well. You can say, "I'm home. It's movie time. I'm leaving now." And the whole scene can automatically happen just by talking to your HomePod. And because there is a HomePod base-- the HomeKit base built into HomePod, that means anywhere in the world, once you set up your first HomePod, you control your HomeKit devices remotely using the built-in Home app on your iPhone or iPad. Now, setting up a HomePod and its microphone array in your home, you probably have a question that we've worked really hard to deal with, which is privacy. Our team cares deeply about your privacy. So for example, it has that magic phrase, hey Siri. Until you say it, nothing is being sent to Apple. It recognizes when you do say it and from that point it sends an anonymous Siri ID in order to help you with the command you're looking for. And of course that communication is all encrypted. So this is the HomePod. It's a breakthrough home speaker. Typically Wi-Fi speakers, if they're a good quality, of $300 to $500. And a smart speaker might cost you $100 to $200. So it's not unreasonable for a HomePod to be priced in the range of $400 to $700. So we're really excited to tell you that HomePod is going to be priced for $349. [ Applause ] It comes in white and space gray. It'll start shipping this December, first in the US, UK, and Australia. And then next year we'll start bringing it around the world. So that's HomePod. Back to you, Tim. [ Applause and Cheering ] >> Thank you. It is so cool. We really believe it's going to take your home music experience to the next level. Now, it's been an incredible morning. We've shared with you lots of things this morning and all of them are shipping this year, some now, some in the fall, and others at the end of the year. We got started with watchOS, more intuitive and intelligent than ever before, incredible new features to help us live a healthier life. macOS High Sierra, great refinements in technology that will push the macOS experience forward. Updates to MacBook, MacBook Pro and iMac, faster and more capable than ever before. And iOS 11, a major update of the world's best and most advanced mobile operating system, absolutely jam-packed with new features including a completely new App Store, peer-to-peer payments in Apple Pay. And with ARKit, iOS 11 becomes the world's largest augmented reality platform overnight. iPad is taken to a whole new level with incredible iPad features in iOS 11. It's the biggest release for iPad ever. And of course a new line up of iPad Pro with an all new perfect 10.5-inch size with advanced displays, powerful new features that enable people to do more with their iPads than ever before. And we gave you two sneak peaks, iMac Pro, an entirely new workstation class of products that we design specifically for our Pro users. And the HomePod, a breakthrough home speaker with amazing sound and incredible intelligence. It will reinvent home audio. Now, we have a hands-on area for the press set up to attend immediately after the keynote. And for all developers, we welcome you to come by from 4 to 7 p.m. this evening. We've got over a hundred sessions planned for you this week, and over a thousand Apple engineers here to spend time with you, so take advantage of the time. Tomorrow we've got a special fireside chat planned in the morning in this room. And someone will be joining us that's devoted her entire career to highlighting and encouraging young people, women and doers. I'm very excited to tell you that Michelle Obama will join us. [ Applause ] She'll be joining us for the open session in this room tomorrow and she'll be talking about empowering people from all walks of life to change the world. This is a very special treat and I encourage everyone to come. I hope everyone here has a fantastic week. Thank you. Thank you. [ Applause ] [Music] [Applause] [Music] using a very powerful magic wand the queen has turned the Seven Dwarves into stone statues Snow White was helpless to stop it Jack and flora returned to face

Don't stay up too late. >> MALE SPEAKER: Come on. >> MALE SPEAKER: All right. >> MALE SPEAKER: Yes. >> MALE SPEAKER: Woo. This is good. (Music playing) (Applause) >> TIM COOK: Wow. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Good morning. And welcome to WWDC 2019. (Applause) It is so great to be here
with you today in San Jose. We are so inspired by the
millions of incredible Apple Developers
around the world. Your dreams and your
passion and dedication to fulfill those dreams comes
across so clearly in the apps that you create, apps
that enrich the lives of millions of people
around the world. You make the world a
better place and that is why we are here
this morning. So, welcome to WWDC. (Applause) WWDC is more vibrant than
ever with attendees from more countries and more
first-time attendees than ever. In fact, for most of you
in the audience this morning, this is your
first WWDC, so, welcome. (Applause) Apple makes - Apple makes
the best products in the world, products that
integrate world class hardware with world class
software and a growing collection of world class
services to deliver experiences unlike
anyone else out there. In March, we held an event
to talk about our services and introduce you to some
brand-new Apple services. We launched Apple News+
which offers a beautifully designed experience for
more than 300 popular magazines, digital
publications and newspapers. There is no service out
there quite like this. I love it. And if you haven't tried
it, I encourage you to do so. (Applause) We also announced Apple
Arcade, the world's first game subscription service
for mobile desktop and living room featuring over
100 new games from some of the most innovative game
developers in the world. Apple Arcade will be
available later this year. And we introduced Apple
Card which will completely reinvent the credit
card experience. Apple Card will be
available this summer. And we announced Apple TV+
which is a new home for the world's most
creative storytellers. Now, while the service
doesn't launch until fall, we thought it would be
really fun this morning to share with you a sneak
peek of just one of our upcoming show from Ron
Moore, the executive producer behind Battle
Star Galactica and Star Trek. With his new series, Ron
wanted to take us on a journey in which the
space race was a little different than you
might remember it. And it has never ended. So, let's take a first
look at For All Mankind. (Applause) (Music playing) >> MALE SPEAKER: I believe
that this nation should commit itself to landing
a man on the moon and returning him
safely to the earth. >> MALE SPEAKER: After
thousands of years gazing up in the heavens and
dreaming of this day, a man is about to set
foot on the moon. >> MALE SPEAKER: Across
the world, people wait with bated breath. >> MALE SPEAKER:
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a live signal. There he is. The shock across the
nation at this event is just indescribable. The Soviet cosmonaut has
become the first to set foot on the moon. >> MALE SPEAKER: I thought
it was about being first. It turns out the stakes
are much bigger than that. >> MALE SPEAKER:
Get back to work. >> MALE SPEAKER: We are
still in this thing. >> MALE SPEAKER: Change
of plans, gentlemen. There is water
on the moon. This race will be ours
to fight for and to win. And we are not
stopping there. Moon Lab. >> MALE SPEAKER: We need
to accelerate the base. >> MALE SPEAKER:
You are going to be an astronaut candidate? >> FEMALE SPEAKER: No, I'm
going to be an astronaut. >> MALE SPEAKER: We will
go to Mars, Saturn, the stars, the galaxy. >> MALE SPEAKER:
Drifting right. Watch it. >> MALE SPEAKER: Eagle,
this is Houston. Do you copy? >> MALE SPEAKER: This is
not the end of the race. We must keep our
eyes to the future. >> Three, two - (Applause) >> TIM COOK:
Wasn't that great? I've gotten an early look
at the entire season and I loved it, and I think
you are going to too. We can't wait to show you
this series and our other original shows
coming up this fall. Now, Apple TV+ will be
available on the Apple TV app which is across all
of your screens including your Smart TVs. And, of course, the best
way to enjoy this content is with AppleTV 4K which
offers an immersive cinematic experience
delivering the highest picture quality of any
streaming device out there. Apple TV is powered by tvOS,
and tvOS is just one of the software platforms that we
are here to talk about today. So, let's get going. (Applause) I'm excited to share with
you this morning how we are going to make tvOS
even more entertaining and more personal. We completely redesigned
the Home screen, making Apple TV come to life from
the moment that you turn it on with full screen
previews of the best TV shows and newly
released movies. Apple TV is designed to be
used for the whole family, but we wanted to make
it even more personal. Today, the Up Next list
has a mix of shows for everyone in the home, but
when you sit down to watch TV, you want to see the
shows that you love. So, we are introducing
multiuser support for tvOS. (Applause) Now, everyone in the home
gets their own Up Next list plus personalized
recommendations for new shows and movies to enjoy. Now, and it's easy to
switch between family members using the all
new Control Center. It works just like you
would expect it to. TvOS also delivers Apple
Music with over 50 million songs and curated music
video play lists. And now, with multiuser
support, everyone in the home gets their own
personalized music experience. You are going to be able
to see lyrics to your favorite songs in
sync with the music. This is really cool. (Applause) This is the best music
experience on television. Now, Apple Arcade is also
going to look amazing on the AppleTV 4K this fall. Playing great games like
Ocean Horn 2, of course, is even better with great
game controllers so we are extending support to two
of the best and most popular game
controllers available. Xbox 1S. (Applause) Yes. And PlayStation
DualShock 4. (Applause) Yeah. I think there is a few
PlayStation fans out there. Finally, let's talk about
our beautiful screensavers. We have already captured
some of the most stunning locations around the globe
and even some from outer space through our
collaboration with the International
Space Station. This year, we are
going under the sea. Oh, it's awesome. (Applause) We've partnered with BBC
Natural History unit to shoot beautiful 4K HDR
footage, taking you to places that few people
have ever experienced before. So, that's the new tvOS. More personal and more
entertaining than ever. (Applause) Now, let's talk
about Apple Watch. (Applause) Yeah. Apple Watch is the number
one watch in the world. It keeps you connected to
the people and information you care about just by
raising your wrist. It tracks your workouts
and motivates you to stay active throughout the day. And with new breakthrough
features like fall detection, heart
notifications and ACG, the Apple Watch has truly
become an intelligent guardian for your health. For so many of us, the
Apple Watch has become an essential part of
our daily life. Today, we are going to
take another leap forward with the watchOS to bring
new experiences to Apple Watch while enhancing the
ones that you already love. To tell you all about it,
I would like to invite Kevin Lynch to the stage. Kevin. (Applause) >> KEVIN LYNCH:
Thank you, Tim. Good morning. So excited to be here. We're thrilled at how
Watch is making such a difference in so
many people's lives. This is driving us to make
Watch even more powerful and more personal for you. Let's start with
Watch faces. Now, these are something
you interact with most every day and we have more
Watch faces this year since the very
first Apple Watch. (Applause) From simply beautiful to
richly detailed, let's take a look at
a few of these. First, we have the
gradient face which is smoothly animating
with the time. Then we have this large
Numerals face showing the current hour in multiple
languages and the very modern digital face
showing you a great look in multiple colors and
then the California dial, classic design
for a Watch face. Now, many of these
faces you can add more information to, such as
adding rich complications here right on the
California dial. Then we have
the solar face. This visualizes the sun's
24-hour path around the dial and you can see it
changing during the day or as you rotate
the Digital Crown. These are just beautiful. (Applause) Now, across all of the
Watch faces, we are introducing taptic chimes. And when enabled, on the
hour, you will feel a silent taptic on your
wrist and if sound is on, you will hear an audible
chime like this. Yes, that's a bird song. It's actually a robin
captured at Apple Park. I mean, it was
recorded in Apple Park. (Laughter) The robins are okay. (Applause) Now, let's talk
about apps. Now, these are designed
for quick interactions on Watch. First, we are bringing
more Apple apps to Watch. The new Audiobooks app to let you listen to Apple Books and Voice Memos so you can
easily record your thoughts. (Applause) And calculator. (Applause) And check this out; it
also includes the ability to do tip calculations,
including the ability to split the bill
with friends. (Applause) Now, we are also giving
developers great new tools and APIs to build great
apps for Apple Watch. And we are now making it
possible to create apps that run independently
on the Watch, no longer requiring a
companion iPhone app. (Applause) And now you can get
extended time to access sensor data and complete
sessions like physical therapy with Kya or
brushing your teeth with Colgate or
meditating with Calm. And watchOS 6 now enables
the streaming audio API so you can go with just
your Watch and you can stream great content
like Podcasts, music, live sports games. So, with new developer
tools and a new native UI framework coming this
year, we are enabling a whole new generation
of apps for Watch. Now, to make it easier
for you to discover these apps, we are excited to bring
the App Store to Apple Watch. (Applause) You can browse apps
curated by our editorial team or find favorite apps
like Head Space or Carrot Weather or Streaks,
the Nike Run Club. You can search the full
App Store using dictation or scribble or
just asking Siri. And you can view product
pages to see information like the app description,
reviews, screenshots. And finally, you can
purchase and install an app directly
on your Watch. (Applause) So, discovering and using
apps at Apple Watch is going to be better than
ever with the App Store and these really
great developer tools. Now, we are also adding
new health and fitness capabilities and to tell
you about some of these, I would like to invite to
the stage Dr. Sumbul Desai, our VP of Health, to the stage. Sumbul? (Applause) >> SUMBUL DESAI:
Thanks, Kevin. Apple Watch is an amazing
health and fitness partner, and in watchOS 6
we are adding even more features to empower you to
better manage your health starting with activity. Being physically active is
one of the most important things you can do
for your health. If it were a prescription,
it would actually be one of the most prescribed
medicines in the world. The Activity app on Apple
Watch already motivates you to stay active. It also lets you know
how active you are every single day, but knowing
how active you are over the long-term is
just as important. It gives you a sense of
your overall fitness. So, in watchOS 6 we are
introducing Activity Trends. (Applause) For nine key metrics it
will compare your progress over the last 90 days
with the last 365. If the trends show that
you are maintaining or improving, you will see
an arrow pointing up, and that's great; keep doing
what you are doing. But if you are trending
downward, we will give you simple coaching to
get you back on track. You will see trends for
familiar metrics like move, exercise, and stand,
but you will also see trends for some new
metrics like your workout walking pace, flights of
stairs climbed or even your cardio fitness level. Activity Trends will
provide you with a more complete picture of what
you can do to stay active and even more importantly,
give you the motivation you need for
long-term success. (Applause) Now, let's talk about
your hearing health. Your hearing is
a precious asset. Think about the sounds
that surround you every day, hearing a friend's
laughter, listening to your favorite song. Protecting your hearing is
critical to living your everyday life and
maintaining your independence as you age. Since hearing loss is
often so gradual, it's important to know when the
sounds around you are loud enough to impact
your hearing. Like when you are in the
middle of a construction zone, at a sporting event
or playing your music really loud to drown
out your singing voice. I do that all of the time. The new Noise app uses
the microphone to detect decibel levels and can
notify you if it's reached a level that could impact
your hearing over time. Because the Watch is always
on your wrist, it's in a great position to monitor
your environmental noise. If you tap the Noise app,
you will get more detail and you can use the
complication to check with just the raise of a wrist. It's an easy way to
protect your hearing health. And, of course, this
feature was designed with privacy in mind. It only periodically
samples and does not record or save any audio. (Applause) We think the Noise app
is really going to make a big impact. Now, there is one more
new feature in health and fitness and all of the
women out there, pay close attention because
this one is for you. Cycle Tracking. (Applause) Knowing more about your
menstrual cycle gives you a window into your health,
from simply ensuring that you are prepared, to
understanding your personal patterns
and regularities. As a physician, I know
that understanding what's normal for you is critical
in making informed clinical decisions
and can really enrich conversations
with your doctor. So, in watchOS 6, the
Cycle Tracking app gives you a simple, discreet
ways to visualize your cycle right on your wrist
and it's really easy to use. You can log key aspects of
your period and fertility, including symptoms, and
you can be notified when it's about to begin. You can also choose to
receive a fertile window prediction so you
are better informed. This feature is available
on Apple Watch and because we wanted to make this
available to hundreds of millions of women around
the world, Cycle Tracking is also available without a Watch in the Health app and iOS. (Applause) Yes, for everybody to use. (Applause) You can use it on your
iPhone to do all of those same functions that
can be done on Watch. We are so excited to
bring more focus to this incredibly important
aspect of women's health. Now, back to Kevin. (Applause) >> KEVIN LYNCH:
Thank you, Sumbul. So, the Health app is the
best way to see all of your health data in
one place, and we have redesigned it to be
even more personal and meaningful to you. In the new summary view,
you can see health related notifications. You'll see your favorites,
the information you care about most, as well as
automatically generated highlights so you can see
your health data over time. For example, if you are
more active than you usually are, how
consistently you may have been mindful this week,
or how your heart rate recovered after
a recent workout. Health is using machine
learning on your iPhone to determine which
highlights might be most interesting to you. So, the new Health app is
going to bring you even more powerful
perspective on your health. Now, all of this health
data is securely stored in your iPhone or encrypted
in iCloud, and since there is nothing more private
than your health information, you
control your data. You can decide if you want
to share particular health data with selected apps,
if you would like to share anything at all. Those are some of the
great new features coming to watchOS 6. To give you a look at some
of this running live, please welcome to the
stage, watchOS program lead, Haley Allen. (Applause) >> HALEY ALLEN:
Thanks so much, Kevin. I have been loving watchOS
6 and I'm super excited to have the opportunity to
show it to you today. Let's start with a few
of my favorite faces. This is the new modular
compact face and now I can have a large info graph
complication alongside a beautiful dial. And there is even room in
the corner for a couple of my favorite rich
complications like these two new ones,
wind and rain. Let's tap customize and
check out some of the options. This is the new Noise
complication which tells me how loud it is in here. It's pretty quiet. Let's make some noise
and see how this works. (Applause) Amazing. Thank you. That's great. The next face I want to
show you is one of our most popular faces and
this year we have made it even cooler because you
can customize it to our all new monochrome style. I love the simplicity
of this two-tone look. In the middle here is the
Audiobooks complication and I can just tap on it and
resume right where I left off. And the Now Playing controls
on watchOS 6 are great, showing me exactly
what I need to see for that app. In Audiobooks, I can tap
here at the bottom and find that chapter I want
to listen to again. It's never been easier to
listen to great books on the go. The last face I want to
show you is the gradient face. Kevin showed you how
beautiful it looks full screen and I can also
customize it to add all of my favorite rich
complications. I'm constantly
multitasking. With a busy job and a son
at home sometimes I only have a moment to
capture a quick thought. Let me tap on the Voice
Memos complication in the bottom right corner
and do that now. Remind Marcus that just
because you are almost seven does not mean you get to, quote, "Veto your bedtime." Okay. Now, I'm super excited to
give you the first look at the all new App Store. With curated collections
and apps, it's super easy to discover and download
great apps for the Watch. Let's check out Chineasy. I can just tap here to see
ratings and screenshots. And I can download it
directly from my Watch. It's super convenient. Let me show you an app I
have already downloaded, the MLB app. With the new audio
streaming APIs in watchOS 6, I can listen in to any
live game no matter where I am. Now, they aren't actually
playing right now, but let me just tap here and give
you a preview of how this works. >> MALE SPEAKER: Two,
one, pitch coming. A swing and high
drive to right field. Going back to the
track, it's got a shot. Right at the wall. It is gone. >> HALEY ALLEN: Yes,
isn't that cool? Come on. (Applause) All right. Thanks so much. Those are just a few
highlights in watchOS 6. I think you are
going to love it. Back to you, Kevin. (Applause) >> KEVIN LYNCH:
Thank you, Haley. That was really cool. Now, there is so much
more to watchOS 6, like recognizing songs with
Shazam built right in and automatic software updates
right on your Watch. Now, lastly, we know how
personalized you like to make Watch from the Watch
faces to the physical bands, and we are
introducing today some new summer colors and an all-new Pride edition Watch band. (Applause) It matches perfectly with
the new pride Watch face on your Watch. So, watchOS 6 is another
large step forward for Watch and it is really an
honor for the team to be crafting something so
personal to all of you. Thank you and back to Tim. (Applause) >> TIM COOK:
Thank you, Kevin. All of these great new
features will make the Apple Watch an even more indispensable part of your daily life. Now, let's talk about iOS,
the world's most powerful mobile Operating System. (Applause) Last year, we delivered
iOS 12 which is full of amazing features from
dynamic new AR experiences and Memoji to screen time
and faster performance, and once again, iOS has
the highest customer satisfaction in the
industry with an incredible 97%. This is unbelievable. (Applause) And as always, our
adoption rate is industry leading as well. 85% of iOS customers are
on the latest release. And in fact, iOS 12 has
been installed on more systems than any
version of iOS ever. Now, that's in stark
contrast to the latest offering from those other
guys which was released before iOS 12; they
only have 10% adoption. (Applause) Now, this high adoption
rate is a huge benefit for both users and developers. Now, to tell you about the
next major release of iOS, I'd like to hand
it over to Craig. Craig. (Applause) >> CRAIG FEDERIGHI: Hello. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. I'd like to talk -
all right, we've got a lot to talk about
this morning. I'd like to talk about our
next big release of iOS. Now, when it came to
naming this release, our crack marketing team
really surprised us this year by demonstrating
their ability to count well into the
double digits. Yes, it's iOS 13. (Applause) Now, iOS 13 is a huge
release packed with lots of capabilities, but we
know that nothing is more important to our iPhone
users than performance. So, this year, we worked
top to bottom in the system, making everything
faster that you do the most. Things like unlocking with
Face ID, now 30% faster. (Applause) Now, this one is cool. We have changed the way
that we are packaging apps on the App Store, and when
this rolls out in the fall with iOS 13, you will see
that your downloads are now 50% smaller. And updates, 60% smaller. But what's - yes. (Applause) But what's really
incredible is the effect it has on app
launch speed. It's up to twice
as fast in iOS 13. (Applause) Now, we were able to do
this in a release packed with new features and
there is one that I think is going to really
resonate with some of you here and I would like to
introduce it to you now. Let's take a look. (Music playing) (Applause) That's right. We are bringing
Dark Mode to iOS. (Applause) I'd love to show
it to you live now. (Cheer) All right. (Laughter) Okay. Let's take our first
live look at iOS. Now, here it is in
its traditional light appearance with this
gorgeous new wallpaper, but now let's begin our
descent into darkness. (Laughter) Look at that. The gorgeous dark
wallpaper and notifications look great. Let's take a look
at our Widgets. They look just awesome. Let's take a look
at some apps. We will start with News. Check it out with a
gorgeous dark appearance, so nice. And your calendar, your
daily events have never looked so awesome with
this really beautiful palette. And Notes. Look at this refined
texture, it's really fantastic. Let's take a trip
into Messages. You see how your images,
your emoji, they all look just fantastic. And, of course, the
keyboard, with an extra refined new dark
appearance and some new tricks because now when
you type, you can swipe. (Applause) Just like that. It's really great. Let's take a
look at Photos. Of course, it looks
fantastic in Dark Mode. Now, this is our Dark
Mode Project Team at the project kickoff. You see it was happy times. They did slowly begin
their descent into darkness. We take the details
very seriously. Let's take a look at
our new share sheet. It looks awesome in Dark
Mode, but you notice in the middle sharing
suggestions intelligently based on who you share
with and who appears in the photos. You can share
with just a tap. It's so fast and easy. And finally, music. Your music looks
great in Dark Mode. It can go through some
of my recent play back. Of course, start playing
some music here. And now for the first time
ever, time synced lyrics. (Applause) And that is a quick look
at what's new with Dark Mode in iOS 13. (Applause) So, great performance,
intelligent sharing, the new quick path keyboard
and Dark Mode. But, of course, there
is much more to iOS 13, starting with apps. Let's start with Safari,
Mail, and Notes. Now, Safari has new
options to quickly change text sizing and has per
website preferences. Mail gets desktop class
text formatting controls, including support
for rich fonts. And Notes gets this
beautiful new gallery view, support for shared
folders, and much more. But where we really went
deep is with Reminders. We have completely
reinvented the app, rewriting it from the
ground up to make it more intelligent, intuitive and
powerful and easier than ever to create Reminders. So, for instance, just
type what you want and Reminders will understand
when and where to notify you. Or you can use the new
quick type bar; just tap and enter things like
location or even attachments like photos. With tasks, you can now
associate to-dos with a top-level reminder. Now, smart lists, they
help you keep track of your most important items
and, if you tag a person in a reminder, well, next
time you are in a Messages conversation, you will
automatically get a notification letting them
know that now is time to talk. It's really handy. Next, Maps. Maps is with you
everywhere you are from work, home, or even on
the go with CarPlay. And our team continues its
obsession with building the best possible map. Now, we have outfitted
literally hundreds of planes and cars with
custom sensors and lidar and driven over four
million miles to rebuild our map from the ground
up, and the results are really impressive. Here is our old map and
here is the new map. (Applause) It's just great. Now, we expect to roll out
this map across the entire US by the end of this year
and select other countries next year. But we didn't stop there. There is much more to
Maps, and to give you a quick look at what's new,
I would like to invite Meg Frost, our Director of
Product Design to the stage for a quick demo. Meg. >> MEG FROST: All right. All right. Thank you. I'm so happy to show you
what's new in Apple Maps. All right. First, let's take a
look at that new map. As Craig said, we have
been driving and flying all across the United States, collecting land and aerial data to add significant
new detail to the map. So, now roads and beaches,
parks and buildings look great. We have also added a
couple of very useful new features to our recently
designed launch screen like favorites, where I
can add the places I go every day for quick
and easy access. Now, I can just
tap and go. And with collections, this
is where I can organize all of my favorites
or I can make lists of favorites to share with
friends, or I can finally organize that
next big trip. Let's check out my
SF spots collection. Now, I have been
checking out Chinatown. You will notice in the
upper right-hand corner, there is a new
binoculars button. When I tap that, I get
a brand-new look around window. Yes, this is the right
place to drop in, so I'm going to go full screen. With look around,
I get a gorgeous, high definition 3D view. It's an awesome
way to explore. (Applause) But this is my
favorite part. Turn your phone
and hold on tight. Smoothly move
down the street. (Applause) Yep, I bet you haven't
seen it look like that before. I can tap on labels to
learn more about new places. Yes, I think I will check
this one out later. And those are just a few
of the new features that we will be bringing
to Apple Maps. Thanks, and back
to you, Craig. (Applause) >> CRAIG FEDERIGHI:
Thank you, Meg. Now, we think Maps users
are really going to love favorites, collections and
look around, but there is much more to Maps, like
junction view for China, or the ability when you
are en route to share an up to date ETA with
friends and family with just a tap. But what's most important
is that Maps has been designed to be
private and secure. We always protect your
identity and activity, and there is no need to flip
a switch to ask Maps to start respecting your
privacy because at Apple, we believe privacy is a
fundamental human right and we engineer it
into everything we do. This year, we are
doing even more. I want to focus on three big areas starting with location. Sharing your location with
a third-party app can really enable some useful
experiences, but we don't expect to have that
privilege used to track us, and so this year we are building in even more protections. Now, for the first time,
you can share your location to an app just
once, and then require it to ask you again next
time it wants it. (Applause) And if you do choose to
grant an app the ability to continually monitor
your location in the background, we will give
you reports so you will know what they are up to. Now, some apps try to work
around these protections by scanning for Bluetooth
or Wi-Fi signals to infer your location. Well, we are shutting the
door on that abuse as well. (Applause) Next, I want to
turn to log in. We have all seen buttons
like this, asking us to use a social account
log in to get a more personalized experience
with an app. Now, this can be
convenient, but it also can come at the cost
of your privacy. Your personal information
sometimes gets shared behind the scenes and
these log ins can be used to track you. We wanted to solve this
and many developers do too. So, now we have
the solution. It's called sign
in with Apple. (Applause) Sign in with Apple is the
fast, easy way to sign in without all of
the tracking. Its simple API allows the
developer to put a sign in with Apple button
in their app. You just tap it and you
are authenticated with Face ID on your device,
logged in with a new account without revealing
any new personal information. (Applause) Now, some apps may want
your name, and maybe even an email to send you
information when you are outside the app. Now, we do allow them to
request this information, but check this out; you
can choose to share your actual email address or
you can choose to hide it, and when you do, we will
create a unique random address that forwards
to your real address. (Applause) Yeah. A lot of love for
random addresses here. And that's good news
because we give each app a unique random address. This means you can disable
any one of them at any time when you are tired
of hearing from that app. It's really great. (Applause) So, of course, this entire
experience is meant to help you have control
over your data. Now, this is available
across all of our platforms, and
also on the Web. Now, next I want
to turn to HomeKit. You know, our homes are
such personal places, places where we deserve
to feel safe and secure. So, HomeKit has been
designed from the outset to protect the privacy and
security in your use of home accessories. And no accessory is more
personal than security cameras that film in
and around your home. Now, unfortunately, most
home cameras today send people's video up to
the Cloud, so it can be analyzed to tell the
difference between maybe a leaf blowing in the wind
and someone at your door, but unfortunately, this
risks your privacy. We have a new way; it's
called HomeKit Secure Video. Now, yes. HomeKit Secure Video, in
that case the video is analyzed in your home
on your resident iPad, HomePod or Apple TV and
then it is encrypted and securely sent to iCloud
where no one, not even Apple, can see it. (Applause) Now, of course, you will
be alerted if there is any activity, and you will be
able to review the recordings. Now, storage for ten days
of clips will be included in your existing iCloud
accounts and it won't count against
your storage. Yeah. Netatmo, Logitech and Eufy
will be among the first to provide these cameras
with more to come. Now, in addition to
cameras, HomeKit supports a wide variety of
other accessories. But many accessories don't just connect via HomeKit; they also connect via the Internet
and through your router. Unfortunately, this can
leave them open to attack and we want to make sure
that this can't happen. And so, we are bringing
HomeKit to routers. Now, with HomeKit at
the router, we will automatically firewall off
each of your accessories so even if one were to be
compromised, it wouldn't be able to access
your other devices or compromise your
personal information. The first HomeKit enabled
routers will be coming from Linksys, Eero and
Internet service providers like Charter Spectrum. (Applause) Next up, Messages. Now, we have all received
messages like this, like who is this guy? Well, wouldn't it be
better if you could see something like this,
or maybe even this? Well, now you can because
with iOS 13, you and the people you message with
will be able to share your name and your photo, and
even use Memoji or Animoji to create a photo
of yourself. Now, this information
is only shared when you message with someone, so
you are completely in control of who sees
your name and picture. Now, since we are all
going to be creating a lot more Memoji, we wanted to
make them even better at reflecting our own
personal style, so we've added a huge amount of
new options for makeup, accessories and
so much more. I would like to have some
experts give you a quick look. >> DESI PERKINS: Hi guys. I'm Desi Perkins. >> PATRICK STARR: And
I'm Patrick Starr. >> DESI PERKINS: We're
beauty influencers. >> PATRICK STARR:
From the internet. Today, we're going to show
you how to make a cute, flirty Memoji look. >> DESI PERKINS: Using
all the new makeup and accessories in iOS 13. >> PATRICK STARR:
Starting with eye shadow. >> DESI PERKINS: This is my favorite eye shadow right now. It's called Apple Fuchsia
Number Six and it comes in this really cute
little toolbar. >> PATRICK STARR:
Close your eyes. Let me see. >> DESI PERKINS: Lipstick. >> PATRICK STARR: Pink. >> DESI PERKINS: Red. >> PATRICK STARR: Purple. >> DESI PERKINS: Violet. >> PATRICK STARR: Blue. >> DESI PERKINS: Oh, ash? >> PATRICK STARR: Desi,
you have to go Dark Mode. Darker, darker. >> DESI PERKINS:
Piercings. >> PATRICK STARR: Nose
ring, brow ring, earring, lip ring, tongue ring. >> DESI PERKINS: You can
customize your teeth and hair? Oh, braces, gap
tooth, missing tooth. >> PATRICK STARR:
A mini grill. >> DESI PERKINS: Earrings,
do you think this will be cool? I'm allergic to
fake jewelry. >> PATRICK STARR:
Okay, moving on, hair. How about this? >> DESI PERKINS: We have
to screenshot these. What else? Hats. >> PATRICK STARR: Hats. >> DESI PERKINS:
And glasses. >> PATRICK STARR: Cute,
cute, cute, cute, cute, cute. What do we have here? >> DESI PERKINS:
Last but not least - >> DESI PERKINS AND
PATRICK STARR: AirPods. >> PATRICK STARR:
Everyone, these are our finished looks. >> DESI PERKINS: Thanks,
Pat, for joining me. >> PATRICK STARR:
Oh, of course. Thanks for joining me. Don't forget to like and subscribe. Thanks. >> DESI PERKINS: And Craig,
I have a few tips for you. Let's connect
after the show. (Applause) >> CRAIG FEDERIGHI: So, I
think that's given us all a great deal
to think about. (Laughter) Now, we are all going
to have a lot of fun personalizing our own
Memoji and so we wanted to give you even more
ways to use them. So, we are introducing
something new. It's called
Memoji stickers. (Applause) Now, instead of expressing
yourself like this with emoji in your
conversations, you can now do it like this. We automatically create a
sticker pack for you for each of your Memoji. Now, of course, you can
use them in Messages but we have also incorporated
them right alongside emoji in the system keyboard so
you can use them in apps like Mail or your favorite
other apps like WeChat. And we have made these
usable not just in more apps but also on more
devices because while actually animating a
Memoji puppet with your face requires a device
with a True Depth Camera System, Memoji stickers
and support for the Memoji editor is now supported
for all devices with an A9 chip or later. Next. (Applause) Next, I want to turn to
Camera and Photos where we have given you great new
ways to capture, edit, and experience your photos. Now, I'm going to start
with Portrait Lighting where we put the power of
the studio right in your pocket. In iOS 13, we are
taking Portrait Lighting to a new level. And it starts with a
brand-new effect we call high key mono. It looks just amazing. Now, we are also extending
Portrait Lighting so you can adjust the intensity
of the Lighting Effect just like you could in a
lighting studio by moving the lights closer or
farther away from your subject. So, when you increase the
intensity of the light, it's like virtually
moving the light closer. This has the effect
of smoothing skin, brightening eyes and
facial features. Or you can pull it back
for a subtle, more refined look. And we adapt this effect
uniquely to each style of Portrait Lighting. Next, I want to
turn to photo editing. We have a brand-new
experience so that you control every
element of your photo. You can see at a glance
all of your settings, and with just a tap and a drag,
you can make adjustments. It applies across all of
our existing effects and many more that
are new to iOS 13. But we are - yes. (Applause) But what's really cool is
we are bringing all of this to video for
the first time. (Applause) Now - so now, for the first time, you can rotate a video. How about it? (Applause) But, of course, much more. You can apply filters and
all of these effects. It's just awesome. But, you know, our biggest
change this year is in the way you can browse and
experience your photos. You know, we all have
so many photos in our library, so much great
stuff in there, but it's all often weighed down by
pictures of receipts and white boards and
screenshots. So, now we are using
advanced machine learning to remove duplicates and
clutter and let you focus on your best shots. And we are taking these
photos and we are intelligently organizing
them to create a sort of diary of your life. Using this, you will be
amazed at how you discover the moments in your life
that matter to you the most. Now, we do all of this
inside a brand-new Photos tab. And so, to show it to you,
I would like to bring up the leader of our photos
app team, Justin Titi, to give you a live demo. Justin? >> JUSTIN TITI:
Thanks, Craig. I'm so excited to show you
guys the new Photos app. Let's get started. So, here we are
in all photos. It's got a new home right
here in the Photos tab. We have also given you
more control over how you can view all
of your photos. You can simply pinch to
zoom out and see a bunch of photos or you can zoom
in and see more detail. It is really
fast and fluid. Now, as you can see, I
take a ton of photos of my kids trying to capture
that perfect moment. Oftentimes my best shots
get lost in the sea of images. That's what days is for. I just tap down
here at the bottom. You can see days is
absolutely beautiful. The clutter of the
similar photos is gone. I can just scroll
and enjoy now. So, Photos uses
intelligence to create these stunning
layouts of my photos. Every day looks great. And you can see videos
like this time lapse play automatically for me,
really bringing my library back to life. As do live photos help me
relive those really fun moments. And a simple trip to the
farmer's market makes me feel like a
professional photographer. So, days is simply the
best way to browse your photos. So, let's check
out months. I just tap and even moving between views is beautiful. So, months organizes the
most meaningful events in my library by month. So here is a trip I took
to Tahoe, my kids' last day of school, and
my wife's birthday. Now, this is a video we
all take but we usually forget to enjoy and now
it's playing for me right here. Really fun concert, and,
of course, WWDC from last year; these labs were a blast. So, that's months. It makes it really easy to
browse the greatest hits of your library
in one view. So, let's head
over to years. So, years gives me a high-level overview of my library. What makes years really
special is that it's dynamic based
on my context. So today is WWDC and
photos knows I go to WWDC every year, so now it's
showing me all of my WWDCs from the past. Go try it out. It's awesome. (Applause) I can go all the way back
- I can go all of the way back to my first
WWDC in 2011. I was so excited to
be at that keynote. Now, years can
do so much more. What if today was my
daughter's birthday? Let me show you what
that would look like. So, years is totally
transformed now and it's all about my daughter. As a proud dad, this
brings me so much joy. She's grown up so fast. Her first bike, these fun
times when every meal was a mess, and this
is her first smile. And this video just brings
that moment right back to life for me. I can just tap and I can
relive that whole great day. So that's the
new Photos app. We think you are really
going to love it. Back to you, Craig. (Applause) >> CRAIG FEDERIGHI:
Thank you, Justin. We are so excited to
have you try this out. When you experience it
with your own photos, it's a very meaningful experience. So, that's Camera and
Photos, and as you can see, there is so much to
experience in iOS 13. And now, while much of our
interaction with iPhone is through touch, we
also experience iOS in so many other ways. We use iOS when we are on
the go with our AirPods, when we gather around to
listen to our favorite music on HomePod. And when we are on the
road with CarPlay. And, of course, tying
together all of these experiences is Siri. So, to take you through
what's new with AirPods, HomePod, CarPlay, and
Siri, I would like to invite to the stage Stacey
Lysik, our Senior Director of OS Program Management
to the program and to the stage. Stacey. (Applause) >> STACEY LYSIK:
Thanks, Craig. Let's get started with
AirPods where we have a couple of great new
features coming to iOS 13. First, when you are
wearing AirPods, Siri will now be able to read your
incoming messages to you as soon as they arrive and
you can instantly respond. Let's take a quick peek
and see how it works. >> SIRI: Amy said, "Can
you meet for coffee at 9:00 am?" >> MALE SPEAKER: Tell
her I'll be there. >> SIRI: It's sent. (Applause) >> STACEY LYSIK: Just like
that, Siri helps you stay in the moment, whether
the incoming notification comes from the Messages
app or any third-party messaging app
using SiriKit. (Applause) Another great new feature
is audio sharing. We have all had a time
where we wanted to share a movie or a song
with a friend. Now, you can,
with just a tap. (Applause) Like everything AirPods,
the experience is magical. And when you get home,
there is no better way to keep the music going than
with HomePod and its incredible sound quality. To make that transition
seamless, we are bringing Handoff to HomePod. (Applause) Now, when you walk through
the door, just bring your iPhone close to your
HomePod to instantly hand off your music, a Podcast
or even a phone call. And you can just take it
with you when you leave the exact same way. (Applause) Today, we are
introducing Live Radio. So, you can ask Siri
to play stations from iHeartRadio, Tune
In, and Radio.com. In fact, we have over
100,000 radio stations from all around the world. (Applause) Now, HomePod can learn
to recognize who in your family is talking and
personalize the response. (Applause) Of course, this is great
with Apple Music so now when you ask Siri to play
you some music, it is based on your taste and
your play history and not anyone else's, and the
personalization extends way beyond music to
Messages, Reminders, Notes and more. So that's HomePod. Next, let's shift
gears to CarPlay. CarPlay leads the
industry in adoption with availability more than 90%
of cars sold here in the US and 75% of cars
sold globally. This year, we have our
biggest update to CarPlay since the beginning. It all starts with the
CarPlay dashboard where you can now have your
music next to your maps and you still have
room for Siri smart suggestions, like a garage
door opener when you get close to home or a view of
your next calendar event. You can see your whole day
in the new Calendar app. Music has been redesigned
so your album art is front and center and beautiful. Siri stays out of the way
so you don't lose sight of what's on the display. Siri has always been great
for getting directions or asking for some music and
it now works with third party apps like
Pandora and Waze. (Applause) As you saw, Siri is with
you across so much of what we do on iOS, and last
year Siri became even more powerful with the
introduction of Siri Shortcuts. Shortcuts enable you to
use your apps through Siri and in the Shortcuts app,
you can create your own personalized
multi-step Shortcut. Now, on iOS 13, the app is
built right in and it is more powerful than ever. It is now the one place
you access all of your Shortcuts, including ones
you have added to Siri, and we make it easier to
get started with your first multistep shortcut
using a new feature called suggested automations
which take your habits and personalize it to a
template like heading home or going to the gym. Integral across all of these experiences is how Siri sounds. When we first started with
Siri's voice, we used short clips of audio from
actor recordings, but sometimes when we put them
together, it didn't always sound as natural as
we wanted it to be. So, this year we have
taken a huge step forward using cutting edge Machine
Learning called Neural Text to Speech where for
the first time ever, the voice you hear is entirely
generated by software. As a result, it's more
- it has more natural cadence and
better emphasis. It's most noticeable when
Siri is speaking longer or more complex sentences. Let's have a listen
together starting with iOS 12. >> SIRI: Absolute zero is
the lowest limit of the thermodynamic temperature
scale, a state at which the enthalpy and entropy
of a cooled ideal gas reach their minimum
value taken as zero. >> STACEY LYSIK: All right. So, that's okay. But now let's try iOS
13 with Neural Text to Speech. >> SIRI: Absolute zero is
the lowest limit of the thermodynamic temperature
scale, a state at which the enthalpy and entropy
of a cooled ideal gas reach their minimum
value taken as zero. >> STACEY LYSIK:
Way better. Way better. (Applause) So, that's Siri along with AirPods, HomePod and CarPlay. Thank you. Back to you, Craig. >> CRAIG FEDERIGHI:
Thank you, Stacey. So, that's our next big
release of iOS, iOS 13, and there is so much we
didn't have time to talk about, like the ability
to deal with call spam by sending unknown callers
directly to voice mail. Yes. (Applause) Or low data mode or for
our enterprise customers, the ability to single sign
on to enterprise accounts and have separate iCloud
accounts for your personal and work lives. (Applause) So, you may notice there
has been one thing missing from the iOS 13 story
and that's iPad. Yes. (Applause) Now, from the beginning,
iPad has been built on the technical foundations of
iOS, so, of course, it gets all of these great
new features that we are bringing to iPhone. But over the years, iPad
has also evolved into something unique. You know, with its giant
canvas and powerful features like slide over
and split view, drag and drop and Apple Pencil,
iPad delivers an experience that
is truly distinct. We have some big changes
coming to iPad this year and the time has come to
recognize the platform in a special way. Let's take a look. (Music) (Applause) >> CRAIG FEDERIGHI:
That's right. We are calling it iPad OS
and I would like to give you a first look. So, let's take a
look at iPad OS. Swipe home and the first
thing you notice is this tighter grid of icons,
letting you have more tools at your disposal
right on your Home screen. But what I think is super
cool is watch what happens when I swipe over. I can now pin my Widgets
right on my Home screen. (Applause) It's gorgeous. You get a lot of
information at a glance. Let's turn to
multitasking. Let's start
with slide over. Launch into Safari and
let's just slide over from the right-hand
side of the screen. You can see I have
messages there right now. Now, I can, of course,
change the app I have in slide over. I can just pick up
Reminders and drag it on over. Now, I have Reminders in
slide over so next time I slide out, of course,
there is Reminders. But what if I want to get
back to the last app? Could we make
that super easy? The answer is yes. I can just drag from the
bottom and they fan out just like that. (Applause) With just a tap,
I can switch apps. I can even just slide
along the bottom to move quickly between my
apps in slide over. It's really great. Now, next, I would like
to talk about Split View because now we are
bringing multiwindow capabilities to
apps on iPad. For instance, I have a
single note right here in Notes, but what with I
want to have two notes side by side? Well, now I can. I can tap, drag, and now
I have a split with two notes. (Applause) Now, I can use this across
spaces as well, so here I have two notes, but here
I have a Pages document. What if I have some notes
I want to use while working on my
Pages document? Well, I am just going to
slide on over, pick up another note, and I can
just move back to my Pages space and drop
it over there. Now, I have Pages
right next to Notes. Now that I have notes in
all of these different spaces, well, you can guess
how I can find them, right? I just bring up the dock,
tap on Notes, and we have app exposé now on iPad. Here are all of my Notes
spaces in one place. Now, this just doesn't
work for system apps. It also works for third
party apps as well. So, in addition to Notes
here and Pages, I can have two Microsoft Word
documents side by side. I mean, that's
enterprising right there. (Laughter) And it works great for
some of the work flows in apps like Mail. So, for instance, let's
say I want to reply to this message from Phil. Well, I can just of course
start typing to Phil and then I realize, you know,
I would actually like to draw on some of my other contents
of my inbox for this reply. I can drag that compose
window off to the side into Split View, even
create a split so I can see all of my messages. I can tap through
these other messages. If I find an image I want
to put to my message to Phil, just tap, drag it
out just like that, and check this out; if there
is a link I want to preview, just
tap and hold. I get a preview
of that web page. That looks
perfect for Phil. Just drop it right in
here just like that. Better composing through
multitasking on iPad. And that's a quick look at
the new Home screen and new Multitasking in iPad OS. (Applause) But there is a lot more. Let's start with Files. Now, browsing in Files,
of course, you have icon view, list view. Well, how about
column view? Great for digging through
deep file hierarchies. You get a great file
preview right here and quick actions for things
like rotating documents - images, making PDFs, and
great rich metadata right at the bottom. Now, we are also improving the way that you can share files. For instance, in iCloud Drive, we now support folder sharing. (Applause) And get this; we also have
built in support for SMB file sharing so you can
share from your work PC, home PC, right
in the files. Now, there is one more. That's right, you can now
plug in a thumb drive. (Applause) So, thumb drives, external
disk drives and SD cards, all show up right in the
Files app, but now this one is really great too. Sometimes when you are
working with a camera, you would like to import
directly into an app like Light Room and
now you can. (Applause) Of course, there
is much, much more. It's a huge year for Files
this year, and it's also a huge year for Safari. You know, Safari is just
the perfect device for browsing the Internet. It's like holding the web
in your hands and this year we are making Safari
more capable than ever. When you look at the Web
today, it's often split into kind of two
big categories. On the one hand, you have
the mobile Web designed for the small screen
and mobile devices, and desktop sites that are
designed for large screens like on your Mac. And often, websites will
serve up the wrong thing for the iPad. Well, no more because we
are bringing desktop class browsing to
Safari on iPad. (Applause) Now, with this, Safari
does all of the heavy lifting, so instead of the
mobile site, you will see the desktop site but it
will be sized perfectly for the iPad display
and have automatically optimized for touch input. Now, this also works great
for apps like Google Docs, Square Space
and Word Press. They all work great in
Safari now and the desktop class experience
doesn't stop there. We are also bringing
a download manager to Safari. (Applause) Thirty new keyboard
shortcuts and much, much more. Next, I want to
talk about fonts. Now, we all know that
fonts bring out the personality of a project,
and this year we are giving you a new way to
use custom fonts inside of your favorite apps. You will be able to
download them right from the App Store. We are working with all
of the major providers of fonts. Next, we are taking a
big leap forward in text editing, making it even faster with the power of Multi Touch. So, navigating long
documents, you can now grab the scroll indicator
and jump anywhere in the document instantly. (Applause) Now, moving the cursor
is easier than ever. Just pick it up, and drag
it where you want it to go. And selecting text, just
put your finger down and drag out a selection. There is no need to double
tap and no magnifying glass getting in your way. And yeah. And when you have a
selection, check this out, you want to copy or cut,
just a three-finger pinch to copy, and a
three-finger spread to plop it right down. This works across
all sorts of apps. (Applause) And if you make a mistake,
don't worry, just a three-finger
swipe to undo. No more shaking that iPad. (Applause) Finally, I would like to
talk about Apple Pencil. Apple Pencil has quickly
become an indispensable tool for so
many iPad users. It's just perfect for
marking up documents, taking notes or
doing illustration. A critical part of
that experience is the incredible low latency
of Apple Pencil. You know, our goal
was to have it just be indistinguishable for
making marks on a physical piece of paper. Now, Apple Pencil already
leads the industry with a record low twenty
millisecond latency, but we have been optimizing
and advancing our prediction algorithms and
today we are bringing that latency down to
9 milliseconds. It's incredible. (Applause) Now, of course, an
important part of your experience using your
Pencil is a great tool palette and a great set of
tools, and so now in iPad OS, we have redesigned it
and we are providing a PencilKit developer API so
third-party apps can have the same great experience. We have also made it a lot
easier to markup anything on any app. You can just drag your
pencil up from the corner of the screen and just
like that you are you are in markup. You can markup a
screenshot or even an entire document. This works just great
throughout the system. Now, to show you Pencil in
action, I would like to invite up Toby Paterson,
our Senior Director in charge of the iPad system
experience, to give you a demo. Toby. (Applause) >> TOBY PATERSON:
Thanks, Craig. Okay. Well, let's jump into
Notes here and take a look at the new text
editing gestures. It begins with a tap to
place the cursor up there at the top of the screen,
and then to move the cursor, we will just grab
it with your finger, oops - grab it with your
finger, put it exactly where you want it. Now, for typing, there is
the standard keyboard, of course, but watch what
happens when I pinch on it with two fingers. It shrinks down to a new
compact layout and this is really great for typing
with one finger or your thumb while you're
holding your iPad. (Applause) I know. I do this a lot. And you can use
quick path here. Oops. Just like that. Now, to select text, just
hold your finger on a word, sorry. Hold your finger on a word
and just drag it out like that and our new gestures
make text editing a breeze. It's a three-finger pinch,
once to copy or twice in a row to cut, and then a
three finger drop gesture to paste it into
place like that. Now to - (Applause) It's really easy. Now, to undo your
gestures, or to undo your changes, I want to
reassure you, you can still shake your iPad if
you want, but I do find the three-finger swipe
to the left a little bit easier. I also want to note that
these gestures are not limited to text
editing only. They will work in any
application that supports copy/paste, undo and redo. Okay. Let's switch now and
talk about the pencil. So, you can see here at
the tool palette with its beautiful new design, the
new tools, and now you can drag it around the
screen like this. You can pin it to any
edge of the screen, you minimize it down in the
bottom like that, and then with a tap or a drag,
open it back up again. Now, of course, Notes has
been tailor made to work really well with the
Pencil, but you can actually use this to
markup any application on the - on your iPad. Let's switch over to
Safari here and I will show you how this works. So, Craig has put me
in charge of the next software offsite and I
want to share an idea with him. So, check this out. Watch as I drag from the
corner of the iPad with my Pencil like this. It takes you right into
markup where you can see a screenshot of exactly
what you were looking at. But many apps can now
support a new full-page capture mode which you select with this button at the top. Here you can see the
entire document that you were looking at. You can scroll through it
or use the side bar on the right to quickly navigate
and as you would expect, you can mark it up with
your pencil just like this. I will bet we've got a few
Rush fans in the crowd here today, I think. (Applause) Yes. I think Craig would make
a great Alex Lifeson. Now, when you're done,
just bring up the share sheet and you can send it
off right from here and that's how you can easily
markup anything on your iPad. Back to you now, Craig. Thank you. (Applause) >> CRAIG FEDERIGHI:
Thank you, Toby. Those are some great
improvements to Apple Pencil and so much
more for iPad OS. There are a ton of great
new features that take iPad OS to the next level. Well, that's what
I have for you now. I'm going to hand
it back to Tim. Thank you so much. (Applause) >> TIM COOK:
Thank you, Craig. These are just blow
away huge releases. iPad OS built on the
foundation of iOS takes the distinctive experience
of iPad even further. In a powerful new version
of iOS, iOS 13, we can't wait for all of you to
get your hands on these great new releases. Now, let's turn
to the Mac. (Applause) We love the Mac and
our customers do too. In fact, the Mac is the
number one in customer satisfaction by far
in the industry. People use their Macs to
create amazing things, simply and powerfully. We have the strongest Mac
lineup we have ever had, from the new MacBook Air
all the way up to the power house iMac Pro. And for Mac users looking
to really push the limits of performance, there
is one more spot in our lineup that the team has been working really hard to fill. (Applause) Yes. To create a product that
will take Mac further than it's ever gone before
and I am so excited and thrilled to show
it to you now. (Applause) (Music) (Applause) >> TIM COOK: This is the new MacPro and it's incredible. (Applause) It has a truly gorgeous
design and remarkable performance to match. It is the most powerful
Mac we have ever created. And to tell you all about
it, I would like to invite John Ternus to the stage. John. (Applause) >> JOHN TERNUS:
Thank you, Tim. I am so excited to be able to tell you about this new MacPro. Now, in designing this
product, we wanted to build an architecture that
could meet the incredible diversity of pro needs,
a system that offers virtually unlimited
possibilities for customization. And key to this is a
simple and elegant solution for accessing
the internal components. Now, inside you will find
a stainless steel frame that forms a strong
internal structure for the entire system and it
provides a foundation for modularity and
flexibility. The frame also
incorporates stainless steel handles. They feel great in your
hand and they make it easy to move the system around. All of the internal
modules mount to this frame which means users
have 360-degree access to easily configure
components and every sub system has been optimized
for performance. So, let's start
with the processor. Now, we have designed
this new MacPro for our customers who need
the ultimate in CPU performance for tasks like
production rendering or playing back hundreds of
virtual instruments or simulating an iOS app on
multiple devices at once. So, we are using a
brand-new Intel Xeon Processor and it has up
to twenty-eight cores. (Applause) And to get every last
ounce of performance out of this processor, we are
giving it over 300 watts of power and a massive heat
sink for cooling so this means it can run fully
unconstrained all of the time. Now, we also have an
extremely high-performance memory architecture. Six channels of super fast
ECC memory in 12 DIMM slots enable an incredible
1.5 terabytes of system memory. (Applause) Now, let's talk
about expansion. Many of our pro customers
need to add things like fiber channel or audio
DPSs or SDI video to their systems, so we are
bringing PCI expansion back to the Mac
in a big way. (Applause) Because this new MacPro
has eight internal PCI slots. There are four double wide
slots and three single wide slots, and there is
one additional half-length slot that we populate
with an I/O card. Now, this I/O card has two
Thunderbolt 3 ports, two USB-A ports and an audio
jack and there are also two more Thunderbolt 3
ports conveniently located on the top of the system. And finally, the MacPro
has two built-in 10 gigabit ethernet ports. So, one of the most
critical areas of expansion is graphics. Graphics performance is so
important for tasks like animating 3D film assets
or compositing 8K scenes or building complex 3D
environments, but we wanted to go beyond the
typical graphics card design so we've invented
something completely new. Now, it starts with an
industry standard PCI connector, so the slot
maintains compatibility with standard cards. We have added a second
connector that allows us to integrate Thunderbolt
throughout the entire system and provide a tremendous
amount of extra power. In fact, at 500 watts,
this module has the same power capacity as the entire previous generation MacPro. And instead of adding its
own dedicated fan, we have a huge heat sink that's
quietly cooled by the MacPro thermal system. We call this the MacPro
expansion module or MPX for short, and using this
architecture we are going to offer multiple graphics
options, starting with the Radeon Pro 580X, a great
all-around graphics card. For a big upgrade in
graphics performance, the MacPro can be configured
with AMD's Radeon Pro Vega II. Vega II delivers 14
teraflops of graphics compute and 32 gigabytes
of memory with an insane 1 terabyte per second
of memory bandwidth. But we didn't stop there
because with the increased head room of the MPX
module, we can actually use two Vega II GPUs for
double the teraflops, double the memory and
double the memory bandwidth. This is quite simply
the world's most powerful graphics card. Now, these two GPUs are
connected by the Infinity Fabric Link which allows
data transfer between them at five times faster
than the PCI BUS. This is a really big
deal for apps that are optimized to take
advantage of multiple GPUs. And if all of this wasn't
crazy enough, the MacPro can be configured with
two of these modules. (Applause) Enabling up to 56
teraflops and 128 gigabytes of high
bandwidth memory. This is an unbelievable
amount of graphics compute in a single workstation. Now, we have also done
something really special for video editing. One of the challenges in
working with high quality cameras is the need to
convert the native files into proxies for
easier editing. This is a time consuming
and error prone process. Being able to work
directly with the native formats would be a game
changer in these high end work flows so we have
built a brand-new card that we call Afterburner
and it turns your MacPro into a monster of a
video editing machine. Afterburner is a hardware
accelerator card that is built with an FPGA which
is a programmable ASIC and this ASIC is capable of
processing 6 billion pixels per second. (Applause) So, with this custom
solution, we have achieved an unprecedented level of
performance for the ProRes and ProRes RAW codecs. The most powerful
workstations in the world today struggle to play
back just one stream of 8K video, but with
Afterburner, the new MacPro can play back an
incredible three streams of 8K Pro Res RAW. (Applause) Or 12 streams of 4K. This is ground breaking
performance and it means we can finally say goodbye
to proxy workflows. Now, of course, all of
this compute requires a massive amount of power,
and so we have given every MacPro a 1.4 kilowatt
power supply. Of course, all of
that power requires a tremendously capable
cooling system. So, the MacPro has three
enormous fans and one blower that together can
generate up to 300 cubic feet per minute of air
flow and it's very quiet. In fact, when it's under
your desk in typical load conditions, it's as
quiet as an iMac Pro. To seal the thermal
system, the beautiful aluminum housing slides over the frame and latches into place. And its unique
three-dimensional vents are actually machined on
both the internal and external surfaces. The resulting lightweight
lattice pattern maximizes air flow while creating an
extremely rigid structure. And finally, optional
wheels make it easy to move the MacPro
around your studio. (Applause) As you can see, utility
and function define the design of the new MacPro,
and while the specs we have been talking about
are impressive, we have really been focused on
delivering real world performance where
it matters most. To do that, we have been
working closely with a number of pro
app developers. This includes Adobe, Auto
Desk, Serif and Blackmagic who are all announcing support for the new MacPro today. In fact, Blackmagic is
seeing some amazing performance gains. With the Afterburner card
doing the heavy lifting of decoding video, they can
tap into the CPU and GPUs to add effects and
coloring in real time on native 8K content. This is a work flow that
has never been possible before the new MacPro. Side FX, Red, Epic
and Avid are also announcing support today. (Applause) Avid is taking advantage
of the incredible expansion capabilities of
the MacPro to do something never before possible in
a single work station. They are enabling support
for up to six HDX cards. This yields more I/O,
increased voices and two times the DSP processing than any other system can achieve. 3D app developers like
Unity, Pixar, Foundry and Maxon are also
announcing support. Maxon is seeing 20% faster
GPU render performance in Cinema 4D than on a
Windows work station maxed out with three of the
latest Nvidia Quadro cards. We are really excited to
announce that Maxon is bringing their Redshift
render engine to the Mac optimized for Metal. And finally - (Applause) There you go. The folks at Otoy are
already hard at work building a version of
Octane that is really going to shine with the
incredible GPU performance of the new MacPro. We are thrilled by the
excitement and commitment we are seeing from all of
these great developers. And, of course, our own
internal app teams are really excited about
the MacPro as well. So, now, I would like to
bring up David Earl from our Pro X marketing team
to give you a firsthand look at some of the
amazing things you can do in Logic and Final
Cut on the new MacPro. David? (Applause) >> DAVID EARL:
Thanks, John. I am thrilled to show you
Logic Pro 10 running on the new MacPro. To get started, we are
going to open up this music score from a
documentary we are working on that was shot in Kenya. What you see here is a
Logic project and every row is a track and every
track represents an individual musical
instrument performance. So, let's have a listen. (Music) Okay. So, we wanted to have some
fun and see just how far we could push this
powerful new Mac. What you are looking
at here is a brand-new version of Logic and the
theme of this release is all about performance. So, to show performance
I'm going to use these incredibly realistic
sampler instrument libraries. I use the libraries so
that it sounds exactly like a real orchestra
when I create my parts. So, let's add a 50
piece percussion ensemble to the score. And you know what, how about
a 100-piece orchestra? And how about another full
orchestra just because, you know, we can. Now, many composers have
to actually add a second and third computer to be
able to run these massive orchestral libraries, but
the new MacPro with CPU power and RAM can do this
all in a single unit. So, of course, I'm going
to need a lot more to push this MacPro. So, let's add a
ton more tracks. So, we have never seen
this before in Logic. I have got 300, 400, 500,
we can now have a thousand audio tracks and a
thousand software instruments in Logic. (Applause) That's four times the
amount that we had in our previous version of Logic,
and, of course, with all of this going on we
have to check the CPU. Opening the performance
meter, that is 56 threads across 28 cores with more
tracks and plug-ins than we have ever seen
before in Logic. The MacPro still
has power to spare. It's a monster
for running Logic. Okay. Now, let's take this music
score over to Final Cut. It's the Soundtrack for
this beautiful documentary that was all shot
and edited in HDR. It follows Ami Vitale. She is a world-renowned
photo journalist on a recent assignment to Kenya. Now, what we see here, we
have never seen before in a Mac. This is 8K ProRes RAW
playing back at full resolution. Now, what makes 8K so
amazing is that there are over 33 million pixels in
every frame which means it looks great on a huge
display like this, but it includes enough resolution
that we can crop in and reframe for 4K projects
and, you know, we can add 8K effects in real-time
like this animated title, and I think I'm going
to go in and add some advanced color correction
and lens flare without stopping. I don't have to wait
for it to render. Now, so far we have been
watching a single stream of 8K ProRes RAW but this
computer has Afterburner installed which means we
can push it even further and we can have our single
stream of 8K ProRes RAW, add another stream of 8K
and how about a third stream 8K ProRes RAW
running simultaneously. That's 100 million pixels. This has never been seen. (Applause) Never been seen before on
any video editing software on any computer. The MacPro is an 8K power
house and absolutely by far the most powerful Mac
that's ever been created for professional film
makers and musicians. Thank you. Back to you, John. (Applause) >> JOHN TERNUS:
Thank you, David. That performance is nuts. So that is the new MacPro. It is the most
configurable, most expandable and by far the most powerful Mac we have ever made. But, of course, an
extraordinary computer deserves an extraordinary
display, and to tell you more about that, I would
like to bring out Colleen Novielli from the Mac
Product Marketing Team. Colleen? (Applause) >> COLLEEN NOVIELLI:
Thank you, John. Good morning. Displays are incredibly
important to our pro customers because they
play a vital role in creating their
life's best work. Yet today, if you look at
their wish list, there is no single display that
gives them every feature they have asked for, and this one feature, High Dynamic Range or HDR, it's increasingly requested because it's yet to be delivered with
pro level precision. So, what is HDR? HDR is a way to bring
content to life by better reflecting what the eye
can see in the real world. The eye sees the brightest
specular highlights, really dark blacks,
vibrant, rich color and all of the details
in between. Today, more and more
devices can play HDR content so more and more
pros who create that content, they need
a great HDR display. There is one
class of displays. It's commonly called
reference monitors and these do deliver true HDR
along with these features, but they are still missing
these features and they are incredibly expensive. This one is $43,000. So, our goal,
it was simple. Make a display that
expertly delivers every feature that pros
have asked for. Like the MacPro, the
design is stunning and every element is
built for pros. And it's the most
incredible panel we have ever made. It's a 32-inch LCD display
with over 20 million pixels, and with 218
pixels per inch, it's a 6K retina display. (Applause) It's the largest retina
display we have ever made. It's over 40% larger than
the iMac 5K display, giving pros even more room for their tools and their content. It has P3 and true 10-bit color and reference modes built in. All expertly calibrated
at the factory. And we keep that color
accurate at a super wide viewing angle by using a
cutting-edge polarizer. For contrast, that's
twenty-five times better than a typical
LCD display. (Applause) It's awesome. Now, the cover glass has our industry leading antireflective coating, but for challenging lighting conditions, we have created an
innovative matte option. So, most matte displays,
they add a coating to the glass and this coating, it
scatters the light, but it also adds unwanted haze and sparkle and it lowers the contrast. So instead, we precisely
etch the glass itself for a nano texture surface and
this means enhanced image quality and contrast along
with low reflectivity. Next, we have delivered HDR at a level never seen before. Now, for great HDR
images, you need extreme brightness right next to
extreme contrast or deep blacks, and this is
incredibly hard to achieve. So, we have designed a
back-lighting system like none other in the world. First, a large array
of blue LEDs generates extreme brightness. We calibrate every single
LED on every single display at the factory and
then this feeds a massive algorithm and then this
modulates each LED based on the content rapidly. Then we use custom lenses
and reflectors to actually shape and precisely
control the light. Now, a typical thermal
system would make this impossible to achieve for
more than a few minutes. So, we did
something amazing. We designed the rear
lattice pattern to act as a heat sink and this
doubles the surface area, quietly extracting
heat from each LED. The results are
incredible. This display can maintain
1,000 nits of full screen brightness indefinitely. (Applause) Forever. And 1,600 nits peak. And this is going to allow
our pros to do things they have been dreaming about. So, for example, video
editors can now work with their HDR content exactly
as it's intended and photographers can now edit
an amazing HDR image like this for hours. And that is not all. Those images are going to
have gorgeous, incredibly nuanced contrast, an
incredible one million to one contrast ratio. (Applause) The images this display
produces are truly stunning. With these capabilities,
we have taken this way beyond High Dynamic Range. This is extreme dynamic
range or XDR, and so we call this display
the Pro Display XDR. (Applause) So now, we have delivered every feature on the pro wish list, but there is more. Thunderbolt 3 will provide
seamless one cable connectivity. So, with a 15-inch MacBook
Pro, you can have a stunning two display
desktop setup or with the new MacPro, you can
connect an incredible six displays with 6K
resolution, 120 million pixels. Yes. (Applause) Woo. Yeah. Woo. That's right. Now, there is one more
feature that does not get much attention on other
displays and that's the stand which is as pro
as the display itself. First, it has an amazing
counter balancing arm that makes the display feel
virtually weightless. It provides tilt and
height adjustment and it maintains the display's
angle as it's raised or it's lowered and it has
rotation for Portrait Mode. Yes. (Applause) And this is perfect
for retouching photos, designing a web page
or writing code. Yeah. And it's removable. It quickly detaches from
the display to pack it up and take it on location. And finally, for pros
with unique mounting requirements, we have
designed a base amount adapter that attaches
in a matter of seconds. So, that's the new
Pro Display XDR. It's the only display in
the industry that delivers every feature on a pro's
wish list and more. And now, all pros can use
the same display across the work flow and have
the same incredible XDR viewing experience with
all of the features they need to create their
life's best work, making this the world's
best Pro Display. And now back to you, John. (Applause) >> JOHN TERNUS:
Thanks, Colleen. So that's the new MacPro
and Pro Display XDR. Groundbreaking in every
way, they deliver performance and
capabilities that will forever change
pro workflows. Now, the new MacPro is
going to start with an eight core Xeon processor,
32 gigabytes of memory, Radeon Pro 580X and
a 256 gigabyte SSD. If you look at other
systems configured with comparable components, you will see they cost around $8,000. The new MacPro will
start at $5,999. (Applause) And it's going to be
available this fall. Now, we know a lot of
customers who use the MacPro really want to be
able to rack mount them in edit bays and
machine rooms. So, to support this, we
are also going to have a version optimized
for rack deployment. (Applause) As for the Pro Display
XDR, well, the reference monitors that we talked
about can cost tens of thousands of dollars and still not match the feature set. The Pro Display XDR will be $4,999 for the display itself. And the nano texture
version will be $5,999. The VESA mount
adapter will be $199 and the pro stand, $999. And like the MacPro, they will all be available in the fall. So that is the new MacPro
and Pro Display XDR. Now, back to Tim. >> TIM COOK: Thank you. Thank you, John, and
thank you Colleen. We can't wait to get the
new MacPro and the Pro Display XDR into the hands
of our pro users and see all the great things they
are going to create with them. Now, powering the Mac
experience is macOS, the world's most advanced
desktop Operating System. (Applause) The latest release of
macOS is Mojave with system-wide Dark Mode and
new features for both finder and desktop that
were inspired by pro users but designed for everyone. It's been a huge hit
with Mac customers. The next release of macOS
brings more exciting new features to the Mac, and
to tell you all about it, I'd like to invite Craig
back to the stage. Craig. (Applause) >> CRAIG FEDERIGHI: Great to be back with all of you again. So, for our next major
release of macOS, we are moving out of the desert
into the beautiful waters off the California coast,
a place for sailing, diving and so much more. It's macOS Catalina. (Applause) Now, Catalina includes
cool new features, some really fresh new apps and
some powerful technology for Developers. Let's take a look. We begin with iTunes. Now, iTunes started
completely focused, rip, mix, and burn
songs on your Mac. And then came the iTunes
Music Store kicking off the digital music
revolution. And then it took on Podcasts
and it redefined radio. And then video,
introducing us to on-demand movies and
ad-free TV, and if that weren't enough, it also
handled all of your syncing, making possible
the first iPod and iPhones. Well, now, customers love
iTunes and everything it can do. But if there is one thing
we hear over and over, it's can iTunes
do even more? I think it can. Like how about
Calendar in iTunes? I mean, you could have all
of your appointments and your best tracks
right in one app. Could we take it further? I think so. How about Mail in iTunes? (Applause) And maybe Safari
in iTunes? And how are you going to
switch between these apps? Well, of course you
will add a dock. I think we've nailed it. (Applause) "Truth Be Told" our
team had a better idea. The future of Apple Music
or iTunes at not one app but three, Apple Music,
Apple Podcasts and Apple TV. (Applause) Let's start with Apple
Music because Apple Music in Catalina is the best
music app we have ever made. With its singular focus on
music, it's so simple, but it has all of the powerful
music features you expect from iTunes all while
being just blazingly fast. It's the best place for
Apple Music subscribers, with personalized
recommendations from a catalog of over
50 million tracks. And for those of you that
use iTunes to sync, we made that experience
better as well because now when you plug in your
phone, this is what you see. Nothing. (Applause) If you do want to sync,
you can find it in the side bar in finder; all of your
sync options are right there. (Applause) And next, let's turn our
attention to Podcast. It brings a dedicated
Podcast listening experience to the Mac and
it features all of the great features you are
used to in iOS, like listen now where you can
see new episodes and keep track of your listening across all
of your devices and it has a great new feature and it has to do with search. You know, sometimes you
hear about something on the radio maybe or a new
podcast or something on the news and you think oh,
I want to hear more about that, but you are not sure
what show it was on or even that it appeared
in the title. Well, now we use machine
learning to index the contents of the spoken
content of Podcasts, so now you can search that
content and find the Podcast with just a
few clicks in the app. It's great. (Applause) And finally, the Apple TV
app, your new home for TV and music on the Mac. Now, you will love having
access to Watch Now, including all of your
great channels like HBO and Showtime, and it has
all of your purchased movies for iTunes as well,
and they have never looked or sounded better because
now on recent Macs, we have support for 4K HDR
playback on the Mac with HDR10 and Dolby Vision. And Dolby Atmos playback
as well so you will experience amazing spatial
audio rendered right out of your MacBook's speakers. So, that's Apple Music,
Apple Podcasts and Apple TV, and now I want to
turn to something new. We call it sidecar. Yeah. Now, Mac users love
connecting their laptop to an external display so
they can spread out their work, but often when they
have to leave on the go, they have to leave
that display behind. Well, no longer, because
now you can use your iPad as a second display
for your Mac. (Applause) It's great. You can spread out your
work right across your iPad, but, of course, some
pro users like using these dedicated tablets for
precise input on their Mac. Well, now with the iPad
and Apple Pencil, you can do that too. It works both wired and
wirelessly so you can get comfortable, and it
works across all of your favorite Mac Apps
that support tablets. Now, next I want to
turn to accessibility. Now, we believe technology
is most powerful when everyone can use it. So, we engineer a wide
array of assistive technologies into our
all of our products. Now, for users with
physical motor limitations, voice can be
an extremely powerful way to operate a computer. And this year, we are proud
to introduce voice control. Now, voice control lets
you control your Mac entirely with your voice
and not just that. We are also bringing
it to iOS as well. I would like to show you
just how transformative this can be. >> MALE SPEAKER: Wake up. Voice control is a
breakthrough feature that gives you full control of
your devices, comma, with just your voice, period. It's a whole new way to
do everything you love, period. Like this. Correct love. 16. Open photos. Scroll up. Show numbers. 13. Click share. 3. Tim, next field. Let's ride this one today. Thumbs up emoji. Click send. Open Maps. Show grid. Long press it. 20. Open app switcher. 4. Tap share. Tap Tim. Tap send. Hey, good to see you. Open music. Turn up the volume. (Applause) >> CRAIG FEDERIGHI: So,
that's voice control. Now, it leverages the
latest Siri voice recognition technology to
precisely understand what you are saying and all
of those commands and of course, your voice is
processed locally on device so none of that
audio goes to Apple. Now, next, I want to turn
to a new solution that helps you find your Mac should it
ever be lost or stolen. It's called Find My. Now, Find My combines Find
My iPhone with Find My Friends and it's now
available on the Mac and iOS devices as well. And it has a new twist
because it can now even locate Apple devices
that are offline. Now, this is particularly
important for Macs because often your laptop is
folded up in a bag, asleep, and no longer
on the network. Now, the way this
works is really cool. Let's say you have
misplaced your MacBook. So, even when it's offline
and sleeping, it sends out a secure Bluetooth beacon
that can be detected by other people's Apple
devices nearby. Now, they can relay your
MacBook's location to the network and ultimately back
to you so you can find it. Now, what's amazing
is that this whole interaction is end to end
encrypted and anonymous. It uses just tiny bits of
data that piggyback on existing network traffic,
so there is no need to worry about your battery
life, your data usage, or your privacy. Next, activation lock. We are bringing activation
lock to your Mac to make it far less
attractive to thieves. It's available on all Macs
with a T2 security chip and it works just like
on your iPhone and iPad. So, in the unfortunate
event that your Mac ever is stolen, the thief will
find it completely useless because they can't even
install or boot it unless you reactivate it with
your credentials. Now, I want to turn to
apps because there is much more to the App
story in Catalina. Now, you will find of
course the beautiful new photo browsing experience
in Photos, an updated start page in Safari. The brand-new gallery
view in Notes. And a completely
redesigned Reminders app, but also for the first
time, we're bringing Screen Time to the Mac. Now, it has all of the
same great features from iOS, so you and your
family can understand the complete picture of your
use across all of your devices and all of the
limits are enforced across all of your devices. We think this is going to
be great for families. Now, of course, Mac users
also love third party apps and they love to have
more on the platform. We have been working
on a new project that internally we call Project
Catalyst, and it's new technology that lets
developers quickly and efficiently create apps
for the Mac based on their existing iPad apps. Now, there are over a
million iPad apps out there and we think some of them would be fantastic on the Mac. Now, iPad developers, of
course, would also love to have a greater audience
to sell their apps to and there are 100 million
active Mac users out there waiting for them. Now, if you are running
Mojave, you already use Catalyst technology
because we used it to build News, Stocks,
Voice Memos, Home. Now, that was just V1 and we have learned a lot since then. We have spent the last
year expanding the number of categories of apps the
technology could support and we have tuned it up
so it results in a much better Mac App. We are pleased to announce
that we are making Catalyst available to developers today in macOS Catalina. (Applause) Now, the experience starts
right here in XCode. Just open up your existing
iPad project, check the Mac checkbox. And just like that, you
will get a huge head start because XCode
automatically builds in all of the fundamental
features like cursor controls, window controls
and so forth, and that lets you focus on the
finishing touches, maybe a translucent side bar, pull
down menus or whatever features would make your
Mac - your app just great on the Mac. Now, this means one
Development Team for the first time can build a
single app that can span all the way from
iPhone to iPad to Mac. Now, we have been
working with a number of developers previewing
Catalyst technology, and we have already seen
some great Mac Apps. For instance, the great
racing game Asphalt 9: Legends from Gameloft. Here is what
they had to say. "We had Asphalt 9: Legends
for the Mac running on the first day. It looks stunning and runs
super fast using Metal on powerful Mac hardware." And Twitter, excited to
come back to the Mac with a native app. They said, "We had
Twitter for Mac running - including native Mac
features - in just days. Now a single team can
efficiently manage Twitter for iPhone, iPad and Mac." And finally, we asked
Atlassian, Developers of Jira Cloud, leading
project management solution for agile
software development, to give Catalyst a try. To tell you more about it,
I would like to invite Rob Chatfield, Senior iOS
Engineer, to the stage. Rob, come on up. (Applause) >> ROB CHATFIELD:
Thanks, Craig. Jira has been on the web
for years and recently we have put a lot of effort
into mobile, like our iOS app that offers quick
and easy access to your projects on the go. Many of you have asked us
for a similar experience on the Mac. Well, today, I am thrilled
to announce that we have done just that. We were impressed that we
were able to get the Jira project up and running in
just a few days and it's a huge project. Now, our iOS devs
are Mac devs too. One code base, one team. Here is a preview. The boards view looks
amazing on the Mac display with plenty of room for
multitasking, and the benefit of this being a
native app is that it's insanely fast. We can switch between
these views instantly which is a level of
performance you just don't get on the Web. And this is one project,
so all of the work we did on iPad automatically
translated to the Mac, like keyboard shortcuts,
Spotlight, and Drag and Drop. And it was easy to add
those finishing touches that make it perfect
for the desktop. For example, we added our top tasks into the custom toolbar. All of this never would
have happened without Project Catalyst. We are super excited to be
bringing the Jira app to Mac and can't wait
for you to try it. So, look for Jira Cloud
in the Mac App Store later this year. Thank you very much. (Applause) >> CRAIG FEDERIGHI: So, we
are really excited about this technology and
excited to see what apps you all bring to the Mac
App Store this fall. So that's macOS Catalina. Sidecar, strong security
improvements, great new system apps and Project
Catalyst bringing a whole new way to bring
new apps to the Mac. You know, you have seen
a lot today in terms of tools for pro users, and
you know who our biggest group of pros is? Well, it's developers,
all of you. And, you know, everything
we do for Developers is focused on the goal of
helping you create the greatest and most
innovative apps and we do this by providing tools
and technologies designed to give you a head start. Well, this year we have a
whole bunch to talk about, like Metal and Core ML,
but we are going to cover that later in
the conference. Today I want to focus
on just two areas. AR and Swift. And we will start with AR. Today, we have three
really big announcements, starting with RealityKit. So, you know, creating
complex 3D environments can require deep knowledge
of 3D modeling and mastery of sophisticated gaming
engines like Unity and Unreal, but what about the
developers who want to incorporate 3D and AR in
their apps but they don't have that experience? Well, that's where
RealityKit comes in. It's built from the ground
up for AR with photo realistic rendering,
amazing effects like camera motion blur
and noise, and it is seamlessly integrated into ARKit and has a native Swift API. Now, how do you actually
model your 3D content? Well, that's where Reality
Composer comes in. Reality composer is a new
app featuring Drag and Drop - a Drag and Drop
interface and a library of high quality objects and
animations making it incredibly fast and
easy to build an interactive environment. Now, of course, it's
integrated with XCode, but it's also
available on iOS. So, you can edit, test,
and tune your app right on the device where it will
ultimately be delivered. Now, of course, the
foundation of AR on iOS is ARKit, and ARKit
is a major update. I want to focus on
one area around the improvement in the way
people are handled in AR scenes starting with
people occlusion. Now, this is insane. (Applause) What used to require
painstaking compositing by hand can now be
done in real time. (Applause) Now, by knowing where
these people are in the scenes you can see we can
layer virtual content in front and behind them. And check this out;
Motion Capture. Just point your camera at
a person and we can track in real-time the positions
of their head, their torso and their limbs and feed it as an input into the AR experience. (Applause) Now, Developers are going
to do amazing things with ARKit 3, and that
brings us to Minecraft. Minecraft is the
bestselling game of all time, and a great
platform for creativity. So, to see how ARKit is
enabling Minecraft to go to the next level, I'm
happy to welcome to the stage, Lydia Winters and
Saxs Persson from Mojang. (Applause) >> LYDIA WINTERS:
Thanks, Craig. Our amazing community
inspires us to push boundaries and build
unique experiences. We are here today to show
you our newest creation. >> SAXS PERSSON: We have
been dreaming about a Minecraft in the real
world and Minecraft in Augmented Reality. We share a vision with
Apple, how AR can uniquely connect us to the world
and today technology is ready for that vision. We built something we
think is pretty special. >> LYDIA WINTERS: We are
excited to demo gameplay for the very first time
right here on stage. (Applause) This is Minecraft Earth. >> SAXS PERSSON: Let's
start with the basics. This is a real living,
breathing Minecraft world right on your tabletop
with red stone circuitry, fireworks, flowing water. You can break anything,
you can play with your mobs, and when I look at
Lydia, I can see what tool she is holding and I can
see her name and we can see anything
she is building. >> LYDIA WINTERS: I'm going
to put myself into the build. There I am. >> SAXS PERSSON: Nice. Looks just like you. Let's use Motion Capture
and make your character wave. Try one wave. Let's try the trick
of the double wave. Cool. >> LYDIA WINTERS: This
looks amazing on the tabletop, but let's
use the stage. Here we go. (Applause) Look, Mom, I'm
in Minecraft. >> SAXS PERSSON: You fit
right in with the new people occlusion feature
like you can fit right into your Minecraft world. That only works on iOS. >> LYDIA WINTERS: It's
like hide and seek. >> SAXS PERSSON: This is
a fully interactive world even at this scale. >> LYDIA WINTERS: There
are some interesting levers over here. I'm going to press the one
with the feathers on it. >> SAXS PERSSON: All right. Watch out for
the chickens. >> LYDIA WINTERS:
Chickens. >> SAXS PERSSON: I'm going
to put some seeds in my hand. They should come rushing over. >> LYDIA WINTERS: So cute. Hey Saxs, there is
another lever over here. It has TNT on it. I'm definitely
going to pull it. >> SAXS PERSSON:
Watch out. >> LYDIA WINTERS: I'm
right on the edge. Skeletons. >> SAXS PERSSON:
All right, Lydia. Can I help you out
with the skeletons? >> LYDIA WINTERS:
Thank you. >> SAXS PERSSON: Uh
oh, chicken, sorry. >> LYDIA WINTERS: Oh no. Skeletons only. >> SAXS PERSSON:
I'm trying. All right. That's a huge cave
underneath you we can light up. >> LYDIA WINTERS: It's
hard to believe that there is nothing on the ground
or around us on the stage. It's incredibly immersive. The fun, quirkiness and
surprises of Minecraft are all around to discover. Oh, no, Saxs, a creeper. (Applause) It's always a creeper. Minecraft takes on its
biggest dimension yet, earth. Unleash your creativity,
build with friends and turn the real world
into your playground. >> SAXS PERSSON: Go to
Minecraft dot net to learn more and sign up for your chance to play on iOS this summer. >> LYDIA WINTERS: We can't
wait to see what you do in Minecraft Earth. Thanks, everyone. >> SAXS PERSSON:
Thank you. (Applause) >> CRAIG FEDERIGHI:
Isn't that great? Now, just to be clear, no
chickens were harmed on the stage at WWDC. I know it was very lifelike,
but that was an illusion. So, that's ARKit 3, RealityKit and Reality Composer. It's a huge year for AR. It's also an enormous
year for Swift. (Applause) Now, platform programming
language transitions, they only come along
every 20 to 30 years. You know, C and Objective
C, those were created in the 70s and 80s and Swift
was just launched five years ago and it's
just amazing how strong it's been going. There are over 450,000
apps on the App Store using Swift and
Developers are loving it. (Applause) Yes. Thank you all. But you know, a new
language enables new paradigms and with
it, new frameworks. Now, Objective C enabled
AppKit and then UIKit, improving developer
productivity by an order of magnitude and
ultimately igniting the app revolution. Now, when we introduce
Swift, the first step was to make sure developers
could access these great frameworks while taking
advantage of the languages, speed, and
expressiveness, but, of course, the biggest
gains were yet to come. The true step function in
development would only come when we engineered a
new framework, built from the ground up to take
advantage of everything that Swift had to offer. Today we are announcing
that new framework. It's called SwiftUI. (Applause) Now, SwiftUI is built in
Swift for Swift and it provides a new paradigm. You specify UI with
simple declarations. It makes code really
easy to write and really easy to understand. It's designed to help you build better apps with way less code. For instance, let's take
an app like this, a simple list. We have all written
one of these. It turns out if you want
to write this with support for all of the modern
features, you might end up writing something
like this in UIKit. It's actually quite
a bit of code. Here is that same
thing in SwiftUI. That's it. (Applause) Just a few lines
of Swift code. Yes. Now, there is so much
that SwiftUI gives you. It frees you to focus on
the functionality in your apps and we automatically
do new things for you like when we add Dark Mode,
your app gets it automatically. And of course, the
framework is only part of the story because in XCode
there's a new interactive development experience. You can think about it
like Playgrounds cranked to eleven built for apps. Now, to show you SwiftUI
in action, I would like to invite Josh Shaffer,
the head of our iOS UI frameworks team to the
stage to give you a live demo. Josh. (Applause) >> JOSH SHAFFER: All right. Thanks, Craig. Let me show you how easy it is to get started with SwiftUI. On the canvas on the
right, you can see my simple hello world app. And I can just select the
text on the canvas and when I do, XCode
highlights the code in the editor on the left. Watch what happens
when I edit it. The preview updates
immediately. (Applause) Now, to get started let's
open our library of views. We can see options and
drag one right out and drop one right
on the canvas. As soon as I do, the code
for it is added to the editor on the left. With simple Drag and Drop,
we can get real code created instantly, and
built in inspectors let us adjust the layout of our
views exactly like you would in an app
like Keynote. The inspectors are
tailored for each type of view so you can see the
kind of options that you have, and choose exactly
the one that you want. And I can use the exact
same tools to edit the code directly too. So, with just one step, we
can take this view we have been building and convert it into
a scrollable list of views. Now, a list
requires content. (Applause) Thanks. It's really incredible. Okay. So, a list requires
content and for that we can bring in a model
object that I created earlier and start
connecting it up to our views. For the first public app
written with SwiftUI, we thought it would be kind
of fun to help our friends in product marketing to
choose the perfect name for the next
release of MacOS. So, here we have a list of
themes but we need a place to display a release name. For that, we can drag
in a custom component we created earlier and drop
it right at the top. Now, even with this little
amount of code, SwiftUI already provides default
support for really common features like localization
for right to left languages and, of course,
iOS 13's new Dark Mode. (Applause) All right. Now, let's make this
interactive so that when we select a row in the
table, we will display a name for the theme. Now, we are ready to test
it out and with just a click, we can go from
designing our app to interacting with
it, right in XCode. Now, testing within XCode
is incredible, but I want to try it on a device too,
so with just one more click we can now install
it on our phone and be ready to try it out there. So, let's try farms
or maybe food. That's great but what's
really incredible about this is that we can start to edit
it live right on the device. So, SwiftUI includes
built in support for animated transitions. So, let's see some options
and pick a cool one for the top. Now, this time when we
choose a name it is going to animate in. So, let's say deserts
or maybe beaches. That's better, but we
all know that product marketing chooses these
names randomly, so to get a feel that matches that
reality, let's wrap our banner in a custom
randomizer component that I built earlier to help us
pick a name and now we are ready to choose the
next name for macOS. That one is not great. Let's try one more. Cute animals
seems promising. Well, that one is perfect. All right. So, because SwiftUI
includes built in support for integrating with
other Apple frameworks, I thought it would be fun
to use the new RealityKit framework to envision
the release of MacOS 10, Flying Squirrel. It looks like it's
going to be amazing. That's a Quick Look at
building user interfaces with SwiftUI and
XCode previews. You are going to love it. (Applause) >> CRAIG FEDERIGHI:
What do you think? (Applause) Now, I'm sure that many of
you are really excited to adopt SwiftUI in your apps
and the good news is you can do it starting with a
single view all the way up to a whole application. And this isn't just
for building iOS apps. For the first time ever,
we now have a native framework for building
Watch apps as well. (Applause) But not just that. SwiftUI is available
across all of our platforms and it provides
bindings to all of the native controls so you can
customize your experiences specifically for each, all
while using a common API. It's incredibly powerful. Now, that's just some
of our big news for developers this morning. I want to thank you all
for spending the time with me. You are so awesome. I'm going to hand
it back to Tim. Thank you. (Applause) >> TIM COOK:
Thank you, Craig. What an incredible morning. Have you enjoyed it? (Applause) Yeah. Today - today we moved all
of our software platforms forward, providing
customers new ways to enrich their lives
and powerful tools to developers so they can
continue to change the world. All of the platforms will
be available as a beta today. (Applause) And the public seed for
macOS, iOS and iPad iOS will be available in July,
and, of course, all of this great software will
be available to our users in the fall. (Applause) Now, you will also be able
to get an early look at the new MacPro and the Pro
Display XDR in our Pro Studio just
across the street. I encourage
you to do that. We have a huge week
planned for you guys, with more than one hundred
sessions, more than two hundred hands on labs,
and over a thousand Apple engineers that are
here to help you. So, seek them out. We can't wait to see what
you guys are going to dream up and how you are
going to continue to change the world. Now, before I close this
morning, I would like to thank everyone that worked
so hard at Apple on all of the products that
you saw this morning. These guys have given up
their nights and weekends from their families and so
on and so forth, and many of these innovations are
years in the making. So, thank you. Let's give them a
round of applause. (Applause) Yes. Thank you all for coming
and sharing the time with us. Have a great week. Thank you. (Applause) (Music playing) - Google sucks at security,
makes ugly software, and most importantly,
innovates slower than Apple, is what you might've thought before today's Google IO. Have you seen what they're
doing with Android 12? And don't even get me started on the range of third-party designs when
Apple's idea of innovation includes updating the look
of the iMac once every, I don't know, 11 years or so
and making a purple iPhone. - Hey! - Okay, those were cheap shots. Apple is absolutely innovative,
but just because they have a world-class team of developers
and designers, doesn't mean that Google can't also have a
world-class team of developers and designers, and it really
shows. So let's dive deeper because there is more to the
story than innovation alone. Like learning about our sponsor, Crucial. Crucial has been making
high quality RAM and SSDs for over 20 years. And with their Crucial
System Scanner tool, finding the perfect parts
for your system is now easier than ever. Check out Crucial at the link
in the video description. (pop intro music plays) Rumors suggested we might get a glimpse at Google's new white chapel SOC, maybe see the Pixel Buds A-series. And of course, we expected
news about Android 12 and Wear OS, but the reality of it is with no IO event last year at all, Google had a clean slate. They could surprise us
and it's safe to say that they did and that they didn't. They didn't pull off an
Apple, one more thing, product announcement. It
is a developer keynote, so it's not like they had to,
but what they did surprise us with, is just how much effort
has gone into Android 12. I mean, look at this. It's superficially more
than a little iOS-like, but it's got its own
style, or more accurately, You've got your own style. Google's new material you UI is front and center, featuring
responsive design that dynamically resizes to fit your content and user tweak-able elements from the color palette all
the way down to line weights. And not only that, but it
can do a lot of the work for you by automatically
generating complimentary colors and even pulling a pallet out
of your phone's wallpaper. Meaning, if you're a
fan of matching themes, you are going to love Android 12. More of these onscreen elements are larger and more animated, which means that you're going to be treated
to a lot more eye candy. They showed off the idea, for
example, of the lock screen lighting up in different
ways, depending on how you woke the phone and the
new combo notification shade and quick settings area is far more alive than it's ever been. Importantly, if Google is to be believed, it's not going to come
at a significant cost to responsiveness or
battery life, where not only have animations transitioning
between apps been shortened but they claim that they're
getting a good 22% less CPU time with 15% less time on
high performance course. Along with your interrupts,
this all means that the CPU is freed up to
do more while also doing much less in the background
which should lead to better battery life. That's awesome, but not as innovative as the new privacy features. The privacy dashboard shows you
a breakdown of how all apps, including Google Zone, have
been using your Android devices sensors, and it quickly and
easily lets you revoke access for apps that you don't trust. Like on IOS, there are
now clear indicators in the system tray when apps use a sensor and there are new toggles for microphone and camera access that you
can use to block access for all apps, including Google Zone. It's not as good as a pure hardware switch but having OS wide controls
like that is a game changer and it's baked right into Android now. This is one area that Apple
has been pushing really hard recently as a shining example of why their closed ecosystem
is superior to Android. And Google has just
pulled the rug right out from under them. Okay? Following Apple's lead
here is not that innovative and we still don't have any control over app tracking in the
same way that IOS provides. But hey, at least if you love Android, you can control the size of your water bottle from lttstore.com, they both cost the same. Moving on to camera, then. Google showed off a new machine learning
algorithm that detects and enhances the auto white balance and exposure settings to make skin tones appear more natural. But this time, for
everyone, not just whites like me. Until now, partly
due to limited dynamic range in photos, de-saturated highlights haven't accurately portrayed
how darker skin looks in real life, and shadows have often ended up crushed altogether.
So, to solve this, Google's created an
algorithm that promises to preserve these skin tones, while
also preventing later parts of the image from being blown out. This is a real problem
that affects real people, and it's really cool to
see that real work is going into solving it. And what's more Google
is planning to release it to the whole Android ecosystem rather than keeping it to themselves for their refresh pixel
line, that should launch alongside the final version of Android 12, sometime in the fall.
This is super innovative and the beta is available right now, if you're interested with One Plus and Xiaomi phones, among
those called out as supported. Aside from Android itself, a lot of focus was spent on Google
search and backend systems, which for a developers conference,
makes sense to a degree but we were really hoping
for some more info on the long rumored white chapel In-house SOC that we think might debut
in the next pixel phones. They did still hint a deeper
collaboration with Samsung, however, when they revealed
long awaited updates to Wear OS, so get subscribed because we're definitely going
to be taking an in-depth look at these when they come out. For now, let's take a moment, though, to acknowledge an area where
Apple has clearly led the pack and Google is playing catch up. This entire list of expected features in the new WEAR OS is stuff
that I can already do on my Apple watch with the exception of
Google's tiles feature. All day battery? Check. Fast app start up? Check. Turn by turn directions? Check. Offline music? Check. Payments without a phone? Check. Quick app navigation? Check. Health and fitness app, freaking check. I mean, don't get me wrong. Most of these things are what Wear OS has been sorely missing and are why the ecosystem
clearly hasn't taken off the way Apple's watch
OS has, but holy crap, has it ever taken them
a long time to catch up. And I am really hoping we end up with something a little less cumbersome that I might be able to actually use. Because as most of you probably know, I don't even keep a SIM in my iPhone. I've just been wearing this
Apple watch as a silent protest against how terrible Wear OS has been. There's some more me too
bits in here as well. Like the ability to use your phones NFC and ultra wide band as a
car key to lock, unlock and start your car. Super sweet. The ability to use your Android as an Android TV remote, complete with voice search and
on-device keyboard support. Yes, for mine video shield. Love it. And the ability to use your phone to unlock your Chromebook, which can now receive
your phone's notifications while you're using it Apple style. Finally, as before, Android
auto is superior CarPlay, It really is guys. Don't don't at me. Back to the question of innovation though. Google's main message this
year was that they're not only catching up to Apple in key areas but also surpassing them in
others that really do matter. And to hear Apple tell it,
that's an impossibility with Google's open model for Android. To say that they can't innovate as fast as Apple is honestly
just kind of ludicrous. I mean, a perfect example of this is project Star Line, a
real-time 3D representation of two people as if
they're in the same room separated by a display. It's
not ready for prime time. and it's possible that it'll
morph into something else and or end up dead before it
launches. Remember tango? But it is the kind of stuff that keeps Googling moving forward along with healthy competition from
other innovators like Apple. Just like our sponsor,

maybe Google's slightly less successful innovation. It's not that it's bad.
It's just, I dunno, just watch the video, I guess. [Music] hey what's up mkbhd here so you know those fish that suction themselves to sharks and you always see them along the side of sharks like they follow the shark everywhere they go swimming alongside it usually attached to it it's called the remora fish and they are fascinating creatures they have this relationship that's kind of amazing for the remora it gets to snack on the scraps of whatever the shark is eating and it has a 24 7 bodyguard basically and the shark allows it to do that because it'll also eat parasites off the shark's back keeps it clean it's a win-win they have a symbiotic relationship meaning they both benefit but really really the remora fish definitely needs the shark way more than the other way around so you never really see them out in the wild without some sort of host or something to attach to now in the tech world apple is that shark and there are a whole bunch of companies you've probably heard of them whose primary business function happens to be an accessory that attaches to something apple does and that is a dangerous place to live so this whole dynamic is it's so fascinating to watch because there's so many examples of it now of course air tags is you know the one recent announcement that's got me thinking a lot about this lately but really any time apple enters a new product category it gets a lot of attention because it's interesting like how will apple do it the apple way will they separate themselves from the competition or do anything technically different and air tags they have some legitimately unique features the little precision find feature makes for a cool demo but bluetooth trackers are not new not even close uh tile has been making these things since 2013 and they do fundamentally the same thing they help you find whatever they're attached to by pinging other phones around that have the tile app which creates a community mesh network and help you find your thing plus there's a couple other features and a variety of shapes and sizes and tile is also built in to some other items but for the core function of finding your thing air tags have a massive advantage which is their network isn't just people using the tile app it's all the stuff on apple's find my network so it's iphones it's ipads it's macs and they'll all passively update the position of something near it anytime it's around a device on that network it's frictionless it happens silently and effortlessly in the background you don't even know what's happening and the network is massive it's approaching a billion devices so there are some best case estimates that put tile's presence in some of the most densely populated cities in the world like manhattan and san francisco at one tile user per block meaning you can't go more than a block without encountering a tile that will update the location on the network which is pretty impressive but when you think about those same blocks in those same cities you're gonna get what a dozen plus iphones and macs and ipads and that's not even considering all the other less populated areas so immediately apple's ability to plug a feature into the iphone gave them a huge advantage over the competition that is the theme so i already made a video called the apple ecosystem explained i'll link it below the like button if you haven't seen it already but i talk about why people keep choosing the iphone because of the walls around the ecosystem but here's another thought because of apple's ability to plug things into the ecosystem especially with the iphone apple can kill entire companies but they don't do it menacingly they do it so nicely by presenting it as a choice on a silver platter less than a month ago apple actually opened up the find my network to allow third-party accessories to take advantage of this incredible network right so out of the gate there were e-bikes and earbuds and conveniently another cheap plastic bluetooth tracker that you can find based on nearby devices in this network amazing so now for tile there's technically a choice you can make a tile that's compatible with apple's find my network or not it's a choice pretty simple but it's actually a bit of a paradox of choice because either way you choose apple still wins so let's say they choose to make a compatible tile that works in the find my ios ecosystem that seems great right it works great for the users they take advantage of that better network but now that means a portion of new tile customers who were going to buy a regular tile that plugs into and improves the tile network will actually be plugging into and improving apple's network instead they'll plug into find my and they won't use the tile app for locating their device which means now tile is selling a product that actively hurts their own business and makes their own network less desirable over time so the other choice is to not participate in the find my network and not offer a tile that works with it which just means you're missing out on those sales and their less appealing network slowly dies over time as people just buy the ones with the more deeply compatible iphone but hey technically it's a choice right look look how friendly this guy is he would he would never force you to do anything he didn't want to you can just you can choose to work with the iphone or not it's up to you you could also choose to swim off into the rest of the ocean or you could stay swimming with me the shark makes sense right i'd actually argue this paradox of choice happens twice with air tags so once with tile as we just saw but also again for the customer so if you're an iphone user now technically you have a choice between the two different options which one is going to require a separate app and has a much smaller network and the other just kind of plugs right in and seamlessly works in the background and not much thought to it and they're around the same price see what i'm getting at now apple apple will always repeat day in and day out there is competition we have competition and you can always choose our competition over the product we make but apple's smart so obviously they know they have deep market penetration with the iphone and so when they want to leverage that to jump into a new product category they'll do it every time they've done it before apple watch is maybe the most popular watch on earth i think they've said this before and airpods are honestly some of the most popular wireless earbuds ever made that's because of the iphone but it's even more fascinating when they literally kill whole companies like when the shark decides to close its mouth and eat the fish that was cleaning its teeth apple's done this so many times i've got four more examples for you each one of them a little bit more brutal than the last so i'm gonna rank them on a scale of one to ten one being a light scratch ten being absolutely finished on how bad apple left them after they jumped into the new product category and if you'll notice they're all on the back of this paradox of choice so flux or f.lux you might have heard of them they are an app that lets you change the color temperature of your screen right so it'll adjust to have more or less blue light output and it can automatically make your screen warmer and dimmer the later it gets in the day flux used to be in apple's app stores but then in 2015 they were kicked out and apple's reasoning was developers can't take advantage of the use of certain private apis so it seems reasonable we all know apple's been very specific about the way you know macs and iphones and ipads should look and feel but what feels weird about that one specifically is later that year apple came out with an update where they built in that exact functionality into the os themselves it's on the mac behind me it's called night shift so with night shift your iphone or ipad or mac can get warmer or cooler based on the time of day or where you're at and it can set a schedule for when you want that to happen super useful of course and convenient now that it's baked in so now you're a mac user you've got a choice you can you can go to the flux website and download it since it's not in the app store anymore and approve it through security and then set it up and get the schedule going or you can just use the one built into system preferences but you have the choice i'm giving this one a five out of ten only because apple could only kill half the company when it's also available on windows and on android if you root but also android's added some of this functionality windows 10 has added some of this functionality so all of them combined would make it about a 10 out of 10 but apple could only kill half all right so then there are ipad styluses and uh this isn't one company so much as it's like a whole product category that sort of got pummeled when apple decided to enter so there's a big variety in this space there's the markers and pens and pencils and styluses that can all write on the ipad's surface and so you can get anything from ultra cheap to ultra premium depending on what you want it to do and then apple just drops in at the high end with the apple pencil now the apple pencil as we all know works with and plugs into the ipad pro better than any other stylus i would say literally because of the first gen apple pencil but no other ipad pro stylus slaps onto the side of the ipad magnetically and pairs instantly and charges while sitting there it works with all of ipad os's built-in tools and minimizes latency with that high refresh rate display it is the best possible implementation of an ipad pro input device plus i can imagine future versions of the apple pencil having a u1 chip right it would make a lot of sense you can add it to the find my network you can direct your iphone to find it when you lose it we all know we've lost that pencil before there's just no way to justify buying a different stylus for 100 bucks for the ipad i mean you can you have that choice so i'm gonna give this one like a six six or seven just because you can still buy the cheaper ones if you just want a very simple input device normal stylus but the second you go hundred bucks plus that whole category it's really hard to compete with the apple pencil so okay then there's duet display so you might not heard of this one but you probably have heard of sidecar the feature right that lets you use your ipad as a second display for your mac what you might not know is duet display is an app and a company that's been built to do exactly this for a long time much before sidecar existed and just like flux you know it still exists still got windows and android and even chrome os versions and actually does still work for ipad but you can imagine most people who are just searching for something on google like how to use an ipad as a second display sidecar is going to come up the majority of the time and it's going to be the easiest way to do it plugging straight into ipad os the majority of the time so duet display does have a couple extra features on top of sidecar like you you can use the touch screen while you're mirroring but still like flux and like tile most people are just going to be satisfied with the first party built-in version so i'm going to give this a 7 because there's still the windows users with ipads who are still gonna make that happen so last but not least there is watson and this one probably hurts the most so this was a search tool in the mac that let you search the web and and search all kinds of other things without actually having to open up your browser and their tagline was actually an innovative utility that bypasses the web browser but as you probably already know apple came out with sherlock 3 which was then called a spotlight which is in everything they make now i use it all the time and it does exactly the same thing search the web search your mac search whatever also the mac does it the iphone does it the ipad does it android phones do it like you can still technically choose to download this original but look at their website like you can imagine there hasn't been a good reason for people to download watson in a long time if this is what their website still looks like that that i'm going to say is a 10 out of 10 rip completely gone right alongside like the flashlight app you remember those when you used to be able to download a flashlight app on the iphone then apple literally built it into the lock screen on ios and now there's no reason to download a flashlight app i mean you can choose to technically but you're not going to so all this is a dynamic i encourage you to pay attention to the shark and the remora of the tech world right and there's a lot of this talk going on in in the public sphere already with the the whole anti-trust and the walled garden talks funny enough the day after air tags were announced tile testified in front of congress to explain how apple was leveraging an unfair advantage to enter that market but of course apple would argue no we didn't we let people choose we gave people a choice everyone had a choice you could plug into the find my network if you wanted to or not that's up to you you can do it the apple way or not whichever product people decide to buy so be it so i don't think there's any correct answer there's no easy right answer but what do you think should apple not be allowed to plug into their own ecosystem and leverage that to make new great products or does apple have too much power in that way but i encourage you to pay attention to when apple inevitably enters even more new product categories like when they make an ar headset or a camera or whatever other new product they do end up making watch how much they plug in to that ecosystem in ways that their competition literally can't and watch how those fish respond to the shark but either way it's crazy to think about how far apple has come from being a small company out of a garage to literally one of the biggest companies ever to exist mostly on the backs of the iphone oh speaking of which my friend renee ritchie also he's made a nebula original on the introduction of that original iphone with a bunch of industry folks including myself talking about you know the fact that that made such huge ripples in the first keynote and what that original iphone meant so you can watch that whole thing on nebula a video streaming service built by independent creators including myself and that is bundled with this video's sponsor curiosity stream so nebula is already pretty dope there's a lot of the smartest creators i know on there minute physics tech alter renee ritchie as i mentioned all using nebula to share their best stuff and sometimes even trying new stuff that doesn't quite work on youtube so i've been putting my videos on nebula ad-free so you're welcome for the info on how to watch the videos without sponsors as a sponsor it's getting pretty meta but besides that curiosity stream is a subscription service sort of built to like my exact tastes it's a home to all kinds of thousands of documentaries and shows about technology and futurism and culture and inventions and the social web all that kind of stuff just look at this category drop down on the site i mean that's pretty amazing i feel like i'm perfectly in the target demographic and if you watch my videos or enjoy them you probably would like these too there's one called shark family tree which looks at how incredible great white sharks are they're all in 4k and there's also plenty more where i can learn way too much about sharks so i encourage you to check them out so since the two together are kind of a no-brainer you can use my code or the link below to get both nebula and curiosity stream bundled together i have a feeling i'm gonna be recommending a lot more of this stuff in the future either way that's been it again let me know what you think of the apple paradox of choice and i'll talk to you guys in the next one peace I like to eat, eat, eat apples and bananas I like to

by Dresage and Hark Madley ♪ ♪ ♪ [MESSAGE SENT TONE] ♪ [KEYSTROKES] ♪ [CAMERA SHUTTER] [FACETIME RINGING] Hi! [MESSAGE SENT TONE] ♪ [CLICK] ♪ - Words cannot express my excitement to check out the new 24-inch M1 iMac. Why? Because honestly guys, I've been doing a lot of soul searching, and deep down, I just really don't think
I'm that into PC anymore. I mean, who wants all those choices for motherboards and
displays and graphics cards, when I could just have one choice, the color. Actually there's a little
and more to it than that. There's three main tiers of the M1 iMac. (groans) Hold on. Got it. Just gotta open the box. Oh! Just trying to get the, you open the thing and it moves the thing. You know what, let's talk about the
performance differences between the tiers a little bit later, because first, I just wanna get hands-on with this thing. It, (screaming) Aw! Is really thin. You know what it kind of reminds me of in terms of proportions? A gigantic iPad. But with a huge chin on it. Wow! I am like blown away by
how light this thing is. Meanwhile, over on the PC side, the concept of a thin client is like a little nook or something that you bolt to the
back of the VESA mount on your monitor. But then apple goes, well, I mean, why don't you
just put the whole computer in a gigantic chin bar? This is the top tier model. So it comes with some
things that the base ones and even the mid tier one don't. Starting with four
Type-C ports on the back. Now, every model gets two
Thunderbolt/USB4 ones, but only the mid tier and upper tier ones get an additional two USB3 ports. Other than that, we've got the
same 500 nit peak brightness, 4.5K display, the same 1080P web cam, which I am extremely excited about. I mean, we're getting A,
Apple's mobile processing on it, and B, finally decent freaking
hardware for a change. And the same microphone
array that apple claims gives us this thing best
in class performance, both from an audio input perspective and actually, oh, yes, there's our, I mean, sort of like a
downward firing soundbar. There's all the internal
speakers along the bottom. You get the same headphone
jack, power button and all that good stuff. But where they differ, is in the accessories and
actually in the internal. Starting of course,
with the magic keyboard. If you go with the base model, you do not get touch ID on the top right of your magic keyboard. For my part, I think that's honestly
already a deal breaker for me for the base model. Touch ID is freaking awesome, always has been and always will be, in my perspective. USB-C to Lightning charging cable. We can put that away for now. Presumably there'll be
enough charge to get started, then we... Yes, good old magic mouse. Who needs to be able to use it while you're charging it, if it can be used for hours after only a few minutes of charge? That's the kind of
interruption to my work day that I need in my life. They have made a conscious
decision not to fix it. This puppy right here, this is the optional upgraded power brick that has Apple's new MagSafe connector. So we just go ahead and... I mean, does it just grab on? Look at that. Wow! It really grabs, doesn't it? And Gigabit Ethernet, and I was really curious how they were doing the data, right? Because obviously this can't just be, you know, 12 volts and ground, right? So there has to be data lines in here. And it turns out that they've got a really clever little kind of triangle shaped guide on two sides of the center
of the MagSafe connector, which means it can only go in two ways. So you've got what is essentially
a reversible connector that's got 12 conductors, which would be enough for USB3? What if it's just Lightning? But is that... I know Lightning is
not quite standard USB2 cause I'm trying to think if that's even fast enough for Gigabit. Imagine being apple and just being able to like
invent your own standards for things. For those of you wondering about the graphic that I've
got on here by the way. This is from dbrand,
who sent over this iPad, and sponsored this video. And they have... This is gonna be a big launch for them. I can already tell because
this thing looks fantastic. This is the black color wave for it. But you can see that the overall pattern is gonna have a common theme. And that's that it has this
kind of folded steel look, like damascus steel, which also happens to
bear a lot of similarities to the top prestige skin in Call Of Duty. They've got their hollow green one, which I've seen already. I think they have a couple
of other ones coming and man, on pretty much anything, this is going to look absolutely sick. As always with dbrand skins, they are perfection fitted, they've got great guides online that you can use to make sure that your application
is absolutely perfect. And their configurator is fantastic. It allows you to see exactly whatever your
device will look like with whatever combination of skins and on whatever combination
of surfaces you prefer. So go check them out. We're gonna have them at the
link in the video description. Again, they said they
really didn't like the look of a black one on this. I think it looks great. So maybe I'm just tasteless, but maybe check out some of
their other skins for your iMac, if this doesn't do it for you. Well, we're not quite done
with the differences yet. There's two more that
apple tells you about. One, is that the mid and higher tier are available in three additional colors. So you get it in yellow, orange or purple, in addition to blue,
green, pink, and silver. And they both come with an 8-Core GPU, rather than a 7-Core GPU. The last difference that
I'm aware of anyway, is that the mid and upper tier one, both come with two cooling
fans instead of one. So it is possible that
that second cooling fan is only necessary because
of the eighth GPU Core. But it's also possible that there could be slight
performance differences between the base and mid and upper tier. We don't know, we haven't tested it yet, this is the first time on opening it. I guess if I spent the extra, I might as well get a, plug an ethernet cable in, right? I'm gonna sound a little spoiled here, but I have to confess I had kind of forgotten
how small 24 inches is. It does not feel like a $1,300 starting at computer size anymore. That's interesting. Now I mean, I can see
why they have a product in this size class, you know, dental offices or whatever, like they need computers too. But yeah, that is not
a big display anymore. Look at that. Got my verification
code on my apple watch. It just works, okay? There's the map of... Not where I am. I'm actually over here somewhere, but don't worry about it. (indistinct) That's what she said. If people can't find their mouse cursor, they just go like this and then it gets big and
then they can find it. Sorry, it's just going through Apple's new secure data storage facility in China. They like built it in collaboration with a Chinese government-run entity. Set up Pace here? Sure, why not. Hey Siri, open the documents folder. Wow, that was so much faster
than just clicking on it. One really nice thing about
the Apple ecosystem is, that default encryption. Look at that. Do you want to use FileVault to encrypt the disc on your Mac? Heck yeah, I do. And whoa, we can set up touch ID. God, touch ID is so amazing. Just pre-pack touch ID on the iPhone. Just make the Apple logo
on the back a touch center. Everyone wants it. Whoa! Dark mode. Nice. Neat. Okay, just gonna have to do
the first thing that I do, which is turn off True Tone, because, don't understand why it exists. Now, let's talk about the difference going from this one to the high tier model, cause on their website, they've kind of got good, better, best. It is pre upgraded from
256 gigs of storage to 512. And then you can just
take the mid tier one and upgrade to 512 gigs
of storage if you want. And then it will be
exactly the same thing. So really there's only two tiers. And just like any M1 based machine, so Mac mini, MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, you're going to be limited to a maximum of two terabytes of
storage and 16 gigs of Ram. Which again, back to, dental offices and the kind of places that you'd be able to
fit a machine like this, is honestly probably fine. Cause you're running Safari, right? You're on a Mac. Not running Chrome or anything. Boy, that really is a clever
idea for cable management. Having the network cable
just like run somewhere else, and then they go and ruin it by not putting the USB-C
on the bottom of the stand or something like that. God, that'd be awesome. But then you wouldn't be able to put it on a monitor arm which we all know many of these are destined to end up on. So all that's left now
then is to prompt you guys to make sure you're

Subscribe to ShortCircuit. at apple we believe privacy is a fundamental human right we work relentlessly to build it into everything we make and it's fundamental to how we design and engineer every product and service we put into the world while others have focused on making customers the product collecting ever growing amounts of personal information we've kept the lens focused on how technology can work for people and that's meant introducing countless features that give users transparency and choice over how their data is collected used and shared you see that with new tools like privacy nutrition labels and app tracking transparency which gives users more information more choice and greater transparency about how their data is used we know privacy is a priority for our users in europe and around the world it's why we're always striving to set a higher bar with new tools that put people in the driver's seat when it comes to managing their own data to share more about some of the privacy features our users will see in ios and ipad os 15 here's craig and the team we don't think you should have to make a trade-off between great features and privacy we believe you deserve both since the beginning we've worked to help you keep your personal data under your control and over the years we've integrated powerful privacy controls into our operating systems most recently adding privacy nutrition labels and app tracking transparency today privacy is more important than ever because when you use the internet and third-party apps you can be tracked by a complex ecosystem of data brokers and ad tech firms often without your permission we don't think this is right we believe in protecting your privacy and giving you transparency and control over your information and to tell you about the new ways we're giving you even more control here are katie and eric thanks craig let's start with mail if you're like me you get a lot of marketing emails like this what you may not realize is that many of these emails use invisible pixels to collect information about your mail activity like when you open a message and even your ip address we think you should be able to choose whether to allow this or not so now in the mail app we're introducing mail privacy protection here's what it does it hides your ip address so senders can't link it to your other online activity or determine your location and it prevents senders from seeing if and when you've opened their email so now you can catch up on email with greater peace of mind safari leads the industry in protecting you against cross-site tracking with intelligent tracking prevention and this year we're making it even stronger by also hiding your ip address from trackers so they can't use it to link your activity across different sites or learn your location you can see which trackers are prevented from profiling you in the safari privacy report we wanted to bring this same transparency to apps you use too so we're introducing the app privacy report this new section settings gives you an overview of how apps treat your privacy you can see how often apps use the permission you've granted to access your location photos camera microphone contacts and more during the last seven days and to find out who your data may be shared with you can see all the third-party domains the app is contacting so these are our new privacy system controls now let's talk about siri siri is available across all of your apple devices allowing you to quickly get things done with just your voice and siri is being used more than ever on over 600 million devices each month we recently added more diverse siri voice options and they sound incredible hi i'm siri if you need anything just ask now siri has a ton of great new features this year but today we want to focus on a major update to privacy series designed to process as much data on device as possible keeping your information private and with the power of the neural engine we're able to do this more than ever today we're introducing on-device speech recognition this means that by default your audio is all processed right on your iphone or ipad this addresses the biggest privacy concern we hear for voice assistance which is unwanted audio recording and this has some great benefits beyond privacy first you can now make many requests without an internet connection launch apps change settings control music and more second on-device processing speeds things up check this out i'll do a few requests back to back open photos open calendar turn on airplane mode set a timer for 20 minutes switch to dark mode wake me up at 7 am it's amazing how fast siri is with on-device processing so those are some of the powerful new privacy protections in mail safari and your apps along with on-device speech recognition for siri back to you tim these new privacy features are the latest in a long stream of innovations our teams have developed to improve transparency and put users in control of their data they're features that will help give users peace of mind by strengthening that control and the freedom to use their technology without worrying about who's looking over their shoulder at apple our commitment is to give users choice over how their data is used and to build privacy and security into everything we make thank you and take care you our goal has always been to build the world's best map so we looked at everything we've done so far and asked ourselves how can we push things even further we started by building a gorgeous interactive globe that invites users to tap and explore we're constantly working on new features to make maps more helpful for the more than one billion of you who use it every month advances in ai are helping us re-imagine what a map can be this year alone we're on track to release more than 100 ai driven improvements but in ios 15 maps will offer incredible new details for commercial districts marinas buildings and so much more we've added things like elevation new road colors and labels as well as hundreds of custom designed landmarks for places like coit tower and the golden gate bridge and we built a beautiful new nighttime mode with a moonlit glow we think all of these improvements are going to make exploring a city so much fun for maps users and when a user is ready to go somewhere maps on ios 15 will make getting there way better let's start with driving we've added a great deal of new road details to the map so we can help drivers as they move throughout a city to better see and understand important things like turn lanes medians bus and taxi lanes and more this outstanding attention to detail including the addition of crosswalks and bike lanes will help drivers more safely navigate complex intersections and when driving on highways maps now renders overlapping complex interchanges in three-dimensional space making it much easier to see upcoming traffic conditions or to know which lane you need to be in and of course we'll be bringing this driving experience to car play later this year we've heard from many of you that you'd like to have more granular information about your surrounding that's why we're bringing you the most detailed street maps we've ever made take this image of columbus circle one of the most complicated intersections in manhattan you can now see where the sidewalks the crosswalks the pedestrian islands are something that might be incredibly helpful if you're taking young children out on a walk or absolutely essential if you're using a wheelchair thanks to our application of advanced ai technology on robust street view and aerial imagery we're on track to launch detailed street maps in 50 new cities by the end of the year having access to rich information is useful but it can also become overwhelming so we're making the map more dynamic and more tailored highlighting the most relevant information exactly when you need it if it's 8 am on a weekday we'll display the coffee shops and bakeries more prominently in the map while at 5 pm we'll highlight the dinner restaurants that match your tastes you can see which places you've been to and get more suggestions for similar spots with just a single tap and if you're in a new city we'll make it easier to find those local landmarks and tourist attractions right on the map you'll start seeing this more tailored map in the coming weeks and as you're planning your day people have found it really useful especially during this pandemic to see how busy a place is before heading out now we're expanding this capability from specific places like restaurants and shops to neighborhoods with a feature called area busyness say you're in rome and want to head over to the spanish steps and it's nearby shops with area business you'll be able to understand at a glance if it's the right time for you to go based on how busy that part of the city is in real time we've also made big improvements for transit riders by helping them easily find nearby stations users can pin their favorite lines to the top and even keep track on their apple watch so there's no need to take your phone out of your pocket maps also automatically follows your transit route notifying you it's time to disembark as you approach your final destination and if you've ever exited a station unsure of which direction you need to go maps will help get you back on track simply hold up your iphone scan the buildings in the area and maps will generate a highly accurate position delivering detailed directions and augmented reality to help you complete your journey we're launching this beautiful new three-dimensional experience in these cities by the end of 2021 with many more to come next year we were the first ones to use ar at scale to help see where to go with signs and arrows overlaid on the real world today we're still the only company who has ar navigation and maps in more than a hundred countries from big cities to rural towns so far though live view has been focused on navigation to help you easily get from point a to point b but now you can also use it to explore the world around you you'll be able to access live view right from the map and instantly see details about the shops and the restaurants around you including how busy they are recent reviews and photos of those popular dishes this is possible because we match what your camera sees with millions of businesses sharing rich information on google maps in addition there are a host of new features coming to live view later this year first we're adding prominent virtual street signs to help you navigate those complex intersections second we'll point you towards key alarm landmarks and places that are important for you like the direction of your hotel third we're bringing it indoors to help you get around some of the hardest to navigate buildings like airports transit stations and malls and that's the all-new apple maps back to you craig so that's just some of what's new in apple maps an incredible new way to explore the natural beauty of the world and an amazing new three-dimensional city experience with improved navigation so that was a lot to recap we are expanding our live view capabilities making maps more detailed and tailored and showing you how busy certain areas are to help you make sense of the world all around you all of this is possible because of our deep deep commitment for over 16 years to build the world's most helpful map for people everywhere wwdc apple's developers conference runs june 7th through 11th and will be entirely online just like last year we're hoping to hear about ios 15 mac os 12 and much more wwdc is nearly upon us and yes you heard correctly the five days of developer sessions will be online only and come under the ever brightening shadow of the pandemic the biggest news will happen during the expected keynote on monday june 7th we expect previews of apple's next operating systems like ios 15 ipad os 15 mac os 12 watch os 8 and tv os 15. there could also be hardware news like a follow up to apple's m1 chip and even new pro max finally so let's break it all down and start with apple's announcement for wwdc which came with a picture and animation of an emoji character looking at a macbook the image is a nod to memes that popped up after apple's november mac event where the company's senior vice president of software engineering craig federighi showed off max with the m1 chip and how they can instantly wake up the video was underscored by the barry white song playing your game baby and appropriately cheesy how cool is that the tagline for wwdc21 is glow and behold usually invites and announcements for apple events include easter eggs so could the fact that the memoji is wearing glasses that reflect software be a tease for the heavily rumored apple ar glasses or perhaps glow is a reference to the headlights on the rumored self-driving apple car or maybe the photo and its animation is just a nod to the new mac os features and its dock now look one of the most exciting parts of wwdc is the preview of the next version of the iphone's operating system it's likely going to be called ios 15 and ipad os 15 for well the ipad last year's launch of ios 14 included new customizations for the home screen picture and picture video better widgets a new siri interface and app library ios 15 rumors point to new notification settings based on your current activity more customizations and interactions for widgets and new imessage features that could make it more competitive with whatsapp and facebook messenger ipad os 15 could add new home screen customizations and the widgets might be freed from their widget lockup yay and get more iphone-like controls last fall apple launched new ipads and recently the new ipad pro with m1 ship launched but the distinction between pro and non-pro ipad models is really based on hardware differences than software it would be great to see more ipad os features support pro users and it's going to be curious to see how the next generation of ipad os goes about handling both a series ipads and m-series ones then there's mac os devoted apples fans always enjoyed the name reveal for the next version of mac os for years os 10 versions were named after big cats like snow leopard and lion then in 2014 with the release of 10.10 apple started nicknaming software after notable california landmarks like yosemite and most recently big sur so maybe the next one will be called mac os monterey or mac os golden gate or perhaps mac os hollywood sign yeah i have no idea there's not much known about apple's next update for its computer operating system there haven't been any specific rumors or leaks it could be that mac os 12 will be a smaller update focused on under the hood changes a la snow leopard back in the day also m1 chips are approaching their first birthday and currently mac os needs to support apple silicon max as well as intel base macs but that points to a bigger question where are the apple silicon pro machines huh pro mac hardware is frequently announced at wwdc keynotes and it's not clear if there's gonna be a new version of the m1 chip at wwe dc21 like a an m2 chip or an m1x chip who knows many of us hope to see a shiny new 16-inch macbook pro or a larger imac pro that uses the pro version of the m-series chip in addition to iphone and computers expect software updates for the apple watch like mac os there are hardly any leak details about watch os 8. that said there are several persistent rumors from the past few years that have yet to materialize one rumor from over a year ago is the inclusion of mental health features for example the apple watch 6 has a pulse oximeter and it could be used along with heart rate readings to detect high levels of stress and even panic attacks another rumor dating back to 2017 hence at the apple watch being able to monitor blood sugar levels however this seems like a feature that would be revealed at an apple watch launch like it would require new hardware like maybe a spectrometer to perform these measurements one feature many of us hope for is removing the apple watch's dependence on the iphone it would open up the apple watch to so many more people who don't have ios devices we saw the iphone divorce from the mac with ios 5 and 2011 but it's not clear what's required in terms of hardware and software to accomplish this for the watch speaking of what if you're wondering how and when you can watch wwdc21 apple typically hosts a live stream for its monday keynote on its website there will likely also be a live feed on apple's youtube channel and apple will stream sessions throughout the week for free for all developers so that's all i've got but now i want to hear from you what are you most excited about when it comes to wwdc is there anything in particular that you're hoping gets announced throw your thoughts in the comments so what's up guys I am back and today I'm going to show you how I can get Apple music for free on any iPhone and iOS so to kick things off jump over to app store and search for documents by Riedl now if you're unable to find this application there will be a link just down below the like button in description now it's not 100 mb/s so it won't take much space on your phone and once you're done installing you can see it is a file manager so that's pretty much it with this application once you're done installing this application open up Safari and search for album lucam that have all the songs every album and all the mixtapes so they're pretty cool you can actually go to any website that you like this is on a sponsored ad for this website so go to any website that allows you download songs this is one of my favorites to just go and look out for any song that you want to download so just select it 900 degrees right here you can actually scroll down until you see a download button but for some songs there is a download button for some there is not so let's click on this red text it actually says the music name you can see a music player just popped out from deer you have to copy the URL now it's pretty simple just open up the share menu and click on copy or just can copy from the top search box once you're done copying this link open up documents by reader now you'll be able to see a small Safari icon in the bottom right corner click on that go to the search bar and copy the link that it just copied it may look a little complicated but is pretty simple now once you enter the link this window will pop up saying you can actually rename the song or change the location it will save ads so make sure you do that and select iTunes right here you can see that green folder so click on that and from here you pretty much golden you can actually rename the song

you may’ve wondered why it shipped from China, rather than a local warehouse or retail
store. And that’s what I’ll explain right now. The majority of Apple’s products are assembled
in China. So shipping them to customers directly from
the factory is usually much cheaper than sending thousands of units to sit in warehouses across
the globe. Now this isn’t the case with certain products
like AirPods or other accessories, since those are considered off-the-shelf items that local
Apple Stores can keep in stock fairly easily. But other, more complex products like Macs
and iPads pose more of a challenge. Since they not only take up more physical
space, but they can be customized in a variety of ways. Making it impractical to keep every configuration
of every model in stock at every store. Actually, Apple used to take this impractical
approach with their computers back in the 80s. Manufacturing hundreds of thousands of units
at once, then shipping them to warehouses across the country. Where they’d sit and gather dust until customers
in that region placed an order. This was extremely inefficient. Since each unit was shipped twice, once to
the warehouse, then to the customer. Also, costs associated with holding inventory
in warehouses can become very expensive. Not to mention this warehousing approach meant
Apple had to limit the number of model variations offered to customers. As a result, older Macs only came in one color,
one screen size, and had few configuration options. But this all changed with something called
just-in-time manufacturing. Which combined manufacturing and shipping
into one seamless process. Eliminating the need for warehousing altogether. Tim Cook was brought on in 1998 to help Apple
transition to just-in-time manufacturing. So instead of building products in advanced,
they would only be assembled once a customer placed an order. This not only saved Apple money, but also
opened up new possibilities for customization. Allowing them to offer products like the iMac,
that came in five different colors with several configuration options. And that same system is being used today. So while you might have to wait a little longer
for your Apple product to be assembled and shipped from China, it’s ultimately a much
better solution for Apple and their customers than shipping locally. This is Greg from Apple Explained, thanks
for watching till the end, and I’ll see you in the next video. um yeah so uh so here's the thing this wwdc was bound to be a weird one but boy was it a weird one now look a lot of people expect hardware at every apple event but that's just not typical of wwdc the last hardware announcement we got at a dub dub was the 2019 mac pro and before that it was the 2017 imac pro and before that i think it was the 2013 mac pro wwdc is not for hardware it's for software really it's for developers and at an event in the afternoon called state of the union they get into the more nitty gritty details of what was announced earlier in the morning at the public keynote what pretty much everyone else sees and in this video i'm going to talk about several cool things announced in the state of the union that apple just didn't mention in the public keynote but i'm also going to talk about the keynote because it was just a little bit weird because of how tense developer relations have been lately look the whole epic games v apple lawsuit has brought out a lot of internal documents and emails that reveal not a very good side of apple kind of just how poorly and of how little value apple views its developers and that has already taken this tense relationship between apple and developers and soured it even more and this was felt through the entirety of the keynote in my opinion with for example an unusually long section about the health app and a several minute segment featuring the apple home app without a single new product announcement pretty much everything they talked about had already been announced previously in the keynote or in the case of matter months ago and it really wasn't until the end that apple even talked about the features coming for developers and it did so with an unusual lack of enthusiasm and self-congratulation now look that's not to say that wwdc was awash ios 15 and mac os monterey bring some really cool features that we're going to talk about but with no hardware to announce for consumers and no good news for developers i've really seen a lot of disappointed and soured faces i'm going to try and turn that ship around because there's some cool stuff but this is not going to be a wwdc to remember let's start off with ios 15 because most of what happens here happens on the ipad and on the mac as well in fact i can't remember a recent software release where pretty much all of the operating systems get the same features it's great to start apple has kind of scoped the crosshairs right onto zoom giving facetime some much needed attention you will now be able to kind of schedule facetime calls in advance by generating share links or calendar events that you can send to friends clients etc and what's more perhaps most surprisingly the receiving end well they don't need facetime natively if they're on an android phone or windows pc they can still participate in a call using facetime in the browser which is very cool it's still end to end encrypted and it has a similar feature set to those using the native facetime app but perhaps unsurprisingly people on that end can't initiate a facetime call only participate in one if you want to start a facetime call you're still going to need an apple device but once you're actually on the call you can use rtx voice i mean i mean noise isolation to block unwanted noise or conversely wide spectrum noise to welcome all the noise spatial audio is added if you have earpods and according to apple it reduces meeting fatigue by placing people's voices kind of spatially where they're oriented on screen this seems a little bit gimmicky to me but i will be sure to give you my feedback on my beta coverage coming over the next few weeks perhaps most importantly and a theme that kind of continues throughout ios 15 sharing now when you're on a facetime call with friends you can use what's called share play which allows you to listen to music together watch tv or video content together heck you can even share your own screen i see this being a huge perk for say students using google docs without having to do in-person collaboration and or a movie night with friends and okay well on the less cool side of things tech support for grandma and grandpa being able to see their screen while you're talking to them to help assist remotely that sounds amazing but look sharing continues far beyond facetime and it's like i mentioned kind of a theme in ios ios will begin to keep track of links that your friends and family send you in imessage and corresponding apps will kind of remind you of their sharing every time you open them so news for example has a section for articles shared by your friends music will have a list of songs and playlists shared safari will have a list of web pages et cetera and when friends share multiple photos in imessage they now appear as a collage or stack of images and they can be automatically added to a special portion of the photos app which is really cool but it only does it if apple thinks that they're relevant to you using ai they'll add images that you're in for example but exclude memes if this works this could be awesome because photo sharing in ios has to put it kindly pretty much always sucked and i would just airdrop friends photos but if i can now reliably send them an imessage and they'll just show up seamlessly in photos that's nice now this next feature is one that i'm pretty excited for because i gotta be honest i struggle a little bit with not getting distracted while working this new feature is called focus and android has a slight variant of this if you have a work profile installed and some oems like samsung let you take it even further but i think apple's implementation goes not deeper but more elegantly because it doesn't take over your entire phone you can set up a profile or a focus for any activity you want work home exercise bedtime etc and the phone will even try to dynamically and automatically you can set those things so if i arrive to the office it's going to turn on the work profile when i drive home it turns on the home profile but anyway you can dedicate a home screen to that focus so that when for example work mode is on it shows my work apps and widgets on a home screen it also allows you to select which apps and which people are permitted to notify you when a specific profile is enabled so no more instagram notifications when i'm in my work mode and perhaps everyone but my co-workers will be silenced what's even better is that you can choose to notify your imessage contacts that you're in a certain focus and have notifications disabled so they don't think you're just blowing them off and they know why you're not responding in a case of an emergency you can still allow certain contacts to get through if they need to which is handy and yes for about the first time in forever apple has finally addressed notifications notifications in ios have always been abysmal it is a thing that android does so much better and has always done so much better that it's not even funny but the gap may be starting to close instead of showing you just a bunch of relevant spam from apps all notifications that are not from humans get moved into a summary list now if you open the summary the most important notifications that the phone determines to be important are sorted at the top and the least important are at the bottom now normal people they still get through just like regular traditional notifications and and that's nice because they don't get stuck in the cruft and the crap of all the other automated you know notifications that you're gonna get this is a big improvement to the ancient awful system that apple has implemented in the past now if only they actually enforce their rules on apps not sending you garbage notifications in the first place now a smaller but very cool update is live text from the camera app safari photos really anywhere you can highlight text inside of an image that is ocr'd and then well you can do whatever you want with it you can paste it or act upon it if the text is actionable like a phone number or email is there you can just click it directly inside of the image it's really pretty freaking cool and it even does live translation now you can also use something that apple calls visual lookup using neural image recognition it'll tell you about the stuff in your picture like the genus of plant or the breed of dog etc this is literally google lens like it is exactly the same thing but it's used system-wide in ios and i think it's going to be a huge hit amongst people like me who are just geeks like that but students and other people i mean this really looks great now let's get to a rapid fire bunch of smaller updates there's a redesigned safari we'll talk about more when we get to the mac but it now supports extensions which is excellent if there are certain plugins that you want to use and that address bar that's been moved to the bottom so there's no longer any finger acrobats to use your web browser nice the wallet now supports uwb nfc devices and there will soon be hotel door keys home deadbolts garage door openers and cars that just unlock whenever you tap your phone on them which is pretty cool additionally digital id cards are being added and in like 45 to 600 years when all of the states in the united states decide to support them i'm looking at you utah it'll be handy to truly be able to give up your wallet and just travel with your phone for your credit card for your identification etc and you'll even be able to travel through tsa checkpoints without physical identification which is freaking awesome now maps also got a big update in certain cities and i must say it looks exceptional now look i know that apple maps generally gets worse the further you veer away from california but i used it in tokyo and i found the metro information to be way better and more reliable and more clear than google maps and here in salt lake city where i live apple maps has generally been more accurate and quicker i'm a big fan and these updates look great spotlight now shows rich results when you search a contact in your phone or a celebrity place or thing and look i'm bored let's talk about the stuff that they didn't announce in the keynote that looks good so focus that thing i mentioned earlier where you can set a profile yeah well they have status apis so that third party messaging apps can also set away statuses which is amazing number two notification muting if a threat is really active and ios just sees that you're not engaging in it it'll suggest that you mute the entire thread number three you can now add multiple passes to wallet instead of one by one at a time like a troglodyte next you can now select a different you can now select a different color for your left and right eye on memoji they talked about how siri will now do on-device processing so that a data doesn't get sent to the cloud but b just results in much faster processing which is great they showed this demo where it did a bunch of things that siri would normally do and it hauled butt awesome and you can also now finally ask contextual questions google assistant has been doing this for like 37 years but for example i could say is chuck e cheese open and then when it responds i can follow up by saying how long does it take to get there instead of having to reiterate that i'm talking about chuck e cheese next up you can schedule future home kit actions through siri so you can say hey turn off the lights at 7 pm or turn on the ac when i leave and it will schedule those actions into the future very cool there's finally a progress bar in the files app when you're performing a copy or move action which holy smokes that could not have come sooner if you're using icloud keychain for passwords there's now a built-in authenticator to generate two-factor security codes so you don't have to use authy or google authenticator or sms anymore which is excellent this one's big temporary icloud storage so if you buy a new ios device you can use icloud backup even if you don't have any icloud backup data available like if you don't pay for a plan or you're out of storage or whatever apple will let you use as much as you need to move to your new device free of charge and they'll store it for up to three weeks this is excellent for people who don't want to pay for icloud but who also don't want to deal with the nightmare that is an icloudless device upgrade this is very good and while i think apple should just give people more than five gigs of storage by default it's better than nothing the dark sky acquisition is finally burying its fruits because not only do you get full screen weather maps but you also get next hour precipitation notifications which is very handy you can now view xf metadata for photos which is sweet a time picker sucks less now you can scroll or you can tap and then type out the time which is really handy best of all the magnification loop is back you can exactly see the text that you're selecting that magnification loop was there from like the very early days of ios and then they took it out because oh it's too skeuomorphic and it looks unnatural but then you can see what you're highlighting on your finger and it sucked and it's been awful finally redemption is here and the magnification loop is back in ios 15 and oh my goodness am i happy about that ios 15 it's going to be out later this fall and it's coming to every device that runs ios 14 which means that yes your iphone 6s is going to get at least seven years of software updates which is incredible yet another reason that the iphone is just a better value buy than most people believe it to be and i know there's going to be people commenting down below that's like oh well they're just making it slower and the throttling and all that stuff uh yeah i don't think so actually but even if they were that's better than not being able to use your phone in seven years because it's too out of date and there's too many security bugs and half the apps that you try to install won't run because you're using too old of a version of android all in all pretty good updates and i think ios 15 is going to be awesome this video is sponsored by ravpower and their excellent new 120 watt desktop charger so i've been using the 65 watt variant that i talked about a few months ago as my primary charging station near my bed it works great for my iphone my macbook nintendo switch and more pretty much anything with a usbc or a usb a port their new 120 watt variant packs in some serious thunder and can charge a 16 inch macbook pro in just over an hour and a half thanks to gallium nitride 2 technology this charger is not only 20 smaller but has a 20 percent higher output than most other desktop chargers on the market and it does so without even getting warm you can charge up to four devices simultaneously at high speed and ravpower throws in a premium usb c cable as well for free because i don't know why they're great at 89.99 retail it's already a pretty good deal but for a limited time you can get this thing for just 80 bucks which is insane thanks ravpower for their support of snazzy labs okay no more mr nice guy now it's time for me to get pissed off because i'm talking about ipad os 15. look i was one of the fools that believed that this year was going to be a huge year for the ipad i mean apple just shipped an ipad with an m freaking one and a mini led display that's crying to have creative content displayed on it and we got nothing this is now the third year that ipad os has allegedly stood apart from ios but for what most of the updates this year was just crap that the ipad never got last year like the app library and springboard widgets ipad os 15 is just ios 14 and that is not a good look for the device that you continue to state apple is class leading and can be a bona fide desktop replacement now look that's not to say that all of the updates were bad multitasking which has long been too confusing for novices but too limited for pros sees big improvements this year there's now a persistent little tab at the top of the device that allows you to handle split view screens and you can now dismiss one half of a split view and open up a replacement app which is really handy furthermore apps can have multiple windows open from within themselves and you can have a center window which kind of acts as the focus of your workflow if you touch and hold an item you might be thinking wait a minute multiple windows yes there's even a shelf which i don't know what they call it just shelf which allows you to see all of the open windows in a given application or workflow and you can quickly switch between them you can also create a split view space in the app switcher and all of this this can be done with keyboard shortcuts so you never have to lift a finger it still seems a little bit uh convoluted and kind of unintuitive and confusing but short of a you know kind of absorbing valuable real estate for something like a menu bar which is you know they're never going to do that it's it's pretty good it's definitely an improvement over ipad os 14. now the new features from ios 15 well they make their way over as well but there are also some cute and unnecessary features like quick note that make their way to the ipad but look all in all apple just demonstrated today that they don't actually believe what they preach at least not what they preach to their customers and developers this is now the fifth year that they have called the ipad a pro device and where's final cut pro where is motion where is xcode where is logic where is main stage they're nowhere to be found they now have an ipad with an m1 and oh cute yeah you can have this little fun little widget you can write a little note by swiping up from the bottom corner i mean what the heck apple they did release a new update to swift playgrounds which will allow you to write to compile and run development apps on device pretty cool you can even actually publish them on the app store but this is going to be severely limited it is no xcode and look maybe it's just a little glimmer into the future of ipad os i have to believe and i have to have hope that there are teams actively working on this crap and i guess now i can only hope that they release it in 2022 but whenever they release these apps if they ever release them it took them too long and it really hindered their single best product from reaching its full potential for years and i'm not going to believe them when they tell me that the ipad is a pro product until they believe it themselves it should be it deserves to be and it's not and that's a shame all right i'm going to get happy again the single coolest thing announced at wwdc was universal control this thing looks straight out of a freaking sci-fi show it's basically a kvm between mac and ipad and holy smokes i cannot wait to use it you will be able to use your mouse and keyboard across multiple devices running different os's i can control my ipad with my imac's mouse and drag it between two screens this is not sidecar it's not mac os on the ipad it is the ipad running independently of the mac but together that is so cool it even works for more than two devices for example an imac a macbook and an ipad you can even drag and drop files and share clipboard history unbelievably cool and exactly what i want now look don't misinterpret my rant that i just did as basically asking apple to put mac os on the ipad i do not want that and ipad os has some amazing strengths in fact i do a lot of my work on the ipad hey which was an email client i used until a few weeks ago had an amazing ios app and the world's most abysmal awful electron mac app it was garbage and i stopped using the service primarily because the desktop app was so bad but if i could prop up my ipad to the side of my mac and use the same keyboard and mouse workflow that'd be freaking sweet make sure you're subscribed because we are definitely going to be checking this out later this week i cannot wait now that brings us to mac os monterey this update is not as big as big sur certainly not visually but mac os 12 really brings some nice changes and i agree with my podcast co-host stephen hackett that it finally seems that apple cares about equality when it comes to the mac again it is no longer neglected and basically every major feature that i have mentioned in this video so far for iphone and ipad they are also coming to the mac focus messages face time quick note live text etc that's all coming and that is excellent there are a few mac specific features that i want to mention though for one safari has been completely redesigned and it looks pretty trippy man but i think i'll get used to it it looks different on the iphone as well but look safari on the desktop it's just my desktop browser of choice it is lightning fast it is responsive and it syncs my tabs across all of my devices it's also one of the two major browsers remaining that haven't given up and just run chromium firefox you are also loved and i appreciate you for not giving in to google now look the new safari has streamlined the tab bar and actually moves the address field based on where the tab is it looks kind of weird but i think it'll be a fairly quick adjustment the window will also change colors based on the background color of the website you're visiting which is a nice although completely unnecessary touch tab groups now also exist which is well pretty much a group of tabs and you can save a bunch of tabs as part of a project or as part of a list or as part of a certain workflow that you want to do and they sync between safari for ios and ipad os a lot of people are really excited about this not me but i don't really do my consistent workflows in a browser if every morning you opened up you know slack and gmail and whatever in your browser that would be kind of handy but i don't really do any work natively in the browser uh shortcuts for ios has done really well and a lot of mac os users were kind of intimidated by automator seeing how complicated tasks can get and so apple's just put shortcuts on the mac you can now access them from the dock from the menu bar from finder from spotlight siri apple's made them kind of available everywhere and just like you know regular shortcuts you can easily share them with a click you can make your own or import others that you find on the web heck you can even import your old auto interactions if you so choose the shortcuts community is really strong on ios it gets pretty geeky pretty fast but i'm a fan and i hope we see a similar community flourish for the mac you can also airplay content from any device to your mac just like you would a tv or homepod which is great this is a feature that i have long questioned the absence of no more air dropping a web page i can just throw the video up right from my iphone pretty handy now there are a bunch of other small things that we just frankly don't have time to go into detail on uh like the addition of tai chi and pilates to fitness plus the launch of what apple dubs has icloud plus which does end-to-end encryption and blocks trackers simultaneously kind of like a vpn and an ad blocker combined now it does have one cool feature though called hide my email and it basically just generates a bogus email address that forwards to your icloud email that you can kill or disable whenever you want over the coming days and weeks we will be looking at the betas extensively as well as all of their hidden features if that is something you would like to see be sure to get subscribed and if there's something in particular that you want to see be sure to include it in a comment down below please give this video a like if you enjoyed it if you didn't well that other button seems to work okay too thank you so much for watching and as always stay snazzy see you later folks [Music] you [Music] hey what's up mkbhd here and today was the first apple event of the calendar 2021 year another virtual one and another pretty action-packed one the spring loaded title was well deserved so this video is me breaking down and reacting to all three of the major announcements because there were three and each of the three was very different from the other also this video is sponsored by expressvpn so for more info on that stay tuned to the end but i'll also have a link below on how to get three months for free so today was april 20th 4 20. and it was a very busy 4 20. the apple event was filled with a lot of great transitions per usual at this point it feels like i have to watch the keynotes once for the new products then one more time for the key specs and all the facts and information and then one more time for the cinematography it's really good like how is our audio so good where are their mics how are they that stable on a boat in the middle of the bay but anyway at the end of the day we have three new major announcements air tags m1 imacs and m1 ipad pros there's chapters below if you're that impatient but let's just start with air tag shall we this was the the one that we were looking forward to for the longest time they were rumored forever it was just a question of when apple was actually going to release them so now they're unveiled and this is air tags so they're a little quarter-sized puck that connects two iphones find my network so you can find them anywhere and they have a little speaker built in so you can ping them and they'll make a noise but the main way you'd find them is the same way you'd use find my iphone or find my mac then when you're within bluetooth range the ultra wideband u1 chip in iphone 11 or iphone 12 will show you exactly how far away it is and where to look and guiding you to finding it simple but super useful air tags just make a lot of sense and this find my network has been so useful for so long because it it runs off the backs of everyone else's iphones so when someone passes by an air tag that's been lost it passively updates the location of that air tag in the background and it just keeps everybody's stuff on the map if you will um also if someone finds a lost air tag they can touch their iphone to it and it'll show a name and a phone number and they can get in touch with you if that was yours so they'll cost uh 29 bucks for one or 99 bucks for a four pack which i was thinking about it that's not it's not that bad that's right about the same price as the cheapest tiles but it's just super well integrated like if you were picking between this and any other if you have an iphone this is in the ecosystem actually my main question would be what would you find with them to justify a four pack i feel like they were really smart about doing four instead of three so if i had four keys are the obvious one um backpack for me would be the other and then maybe maybe a pet collar or something like that or you could give one to a spouse or something like that it's pretty slim 1.25 inches tall and weighs 11 grams so i feel like you can kind of put it anywhere a tile could go it's ip67 water resistant it's made of metal and apple will let you engrave that metal if you're into that with a couple letters or an emoji but the real customization is in the color of the band you choose to put it in also what why is the hermes version so expensive i'm sorry i've never known how exactly to pronounce that but the fact that it's literally 10 times the price of the normal sleeve for the mermaid whatever it's called i wow but also worth noting the spec also lists a user replaceable cr2032 battery which is pretty nice um that's the same type of battery you might have in a watch or a garage door opener one of those circular batteries um which is not the case for all of these find my devices some older tiles didn't have user replaceable batteries so when they died you just that was it they were dead you have to buy another one newer tiles i use replaceable but that's pretty sweet i could easily have seen apple being the company that went the opposite route and said we made a shiny metal one you can't take the battery out they didn't nice but yeah i'll definitely be getting my hands on air tags asap to show you how they work what that experience is like how well you can actually find things with them and whether or not they're worth the money so definitely subscribe to see that video if you haven't already all right next up we gotta talk about we got to talk about these imacs so all the colorful teasers leading up to this event we're kind of hinting at new colorful imacs right maybe it's hindsight 2020 but it was clearly a throwback to the original colorful imacs that came out many years ago so here they are now it's 20 21 and the first colorful apple desktops and a long timer here this new imac redesign in seven very bright colors red orange yellow blue aqua green and silver so the gist here is these are completely redesigned imax from the ground up as you can probably already tell and they have m1 ships inside so there's new performance new internals and then a new outside that i don't like very much like to me okay this imac design is actually super impressive technically speaking right it's got the squared off design now just like the pro display xdr the tilt adjustable hinge on the back and it is crazy thin crazy thin 11 and a half millimeters and the whole thing is 10 pounds which is insane that's about the same thickness as an apple watch two air tags stacked on top of each other thicker than the whole computer believe it or not fun fact this imac is so thin that you actually can't plug in headphones from the back anymore because a typical headphone jack is 14 millimeters deep and the whole computer is 11 millimeters deep so they put the headphone jack on the side now at least they kept it i actually think the size is better but there is a larger 24 inch 4480 by 2280 display up front that gets closer to the edges and also now has white bezels for some reason and there's still a pretty solid metallic chin that now has no logo on it and it matches the color of the back of the imac and the base and the sides are actually a different accent color than the back and the chin so basically the red imac will have a red body and red sides but a salmon-colored chin and stand it's an interesting two-toned look they've got going on and then the insides are completely redesigned around that m1 chip now we already knew the m1 chip was great in the macbook air and the baseline macbook pro but also in the mac mini so it makes perfect sense that well there's actually tons of room inside this imac to continue to be great plus they've dropped an improved camera system and speaker system in here but apple actually showed the inside of the imac and just look at this thing most of the computer is just in those tiny pieces down at the bottom and like a slot basically where that chin is the rest is all thermals and ribbon cables they also made some color matching accessories like this magic mouse and track pad and a new magic keyboard that has a touch id fingerprint reader in the corner very cool uh but just it's ugly right i'm not crazy am i this replaces the 21.5 inch intel imac and there's got to be a larger 27-inch imac replacement coming with like an m1x chip or something and i feel like that version has got to have a way smaller chin and way less crazy colors again this machine despite me thinking it's pretty ugly is technically very impressive being this thin fitting a whole computer in such a thin profile getting dolby atmos supporting speakers in there the performance of the m1 the instant wake all that great stuff that comes from the m1 chip that is super great the power adapter that it comes with plugs in magnetically into the back with a color matching cable and there's an ethernet plug on the brick of at least some of the specs so you don't have to have a cable that runs all the way up to your desk four usb c ports on the back two of which are thunderbolt 3. i wish there was an sd card slot but it looks like there isn't one also there are only two ports if you buy the cheapest model but the fact is i saw this and it was really cool to see colored imacs again but this imac is only really pretty from the back like you you get it out the box and you're obviously like wow this is super thin you put it on your desk then you never see the back again i have no idea how thick these monitors are i also don't really care two inches three four inches i don't really care so i personally think it would have made a ton of sense for apple to put most of this computer stuff behind the display instead of in the huge chin and make this imac a bit thicker right now it's literally half an inch thick maybe make it one inch thick i don't know one and a half it would still look great it would still be very thin but it would look way better without that chin oh and then turn the bezels back to black while you're at it please i'm never gonna get a real answer about why exactly they did it this way maybe it was thermals that they couldn't put it back there i don't know but what i'm pretty sure of is that that's exactly what they're gonna do with a higher end m1x 27-inch imac that comes out probably later this year that higher-end redesigned version will probably look much better because at the end of the day keep this in mind this bright beautiful new imac we're looking at is just replacing the baseline 21 and a half inch model which was not very up to date there were people complaining about you know it maxes out at 512 gigs of storage the one it's replacing maxed out at 256 gigs of solid-state storage then it would do like a one terabyte fusion drive so this is actually a much better computer than the 1080p outdated 21.5 inch imac that it replaces but i feel like there's no way future higher end apple silicon imacs look like this with the white bezels in the chin i'm just saying also i was scrolling through the site just like looking through the design and if you get to just the right point on the page it's at this moment where it's like changing colors and it looks like this kind of split tone imac and it looks actually pretty sweet but you can't buy a split tone imac i'm sure dbrand's already on top of this but anyway last but certainly not least was the third and final big announcement which was the new m1 powered ipad pros which again are very technically impressive because you know the thing we are all worried about with the ipad pros is are they too slow not really but this new ipad pro is in the same familiar design still just as thin and impressive and unibody metal as ever but it's now powered by that crazy powerful and efficient m1 chip and this is super curious to me the a12z bionic was already pretty incredible for the ipad pro and it was optimized for a device with that thermal profile and with that battery the m1 chip in an ipad just seems like huge overkill so this is now an even more powerful tablet than ever before widening their gap and the m1 chip now also means that the usb-c port at the bottom is now a full-on thunderbolt port for those high speeds there's now up to two terabytes of mac storage on the ipad pro which is massive and it gets 5g support on top of that already pretty useful cellular option and then the larger only the larger 12.9 inch ipad pro gets upgraded to a mini led display so this is something we're also looking forward to for a while some of us were secretly hoping for oled the ipad pros have been 120 hertz lcds for a little bit this is probably just as good so now this 120hz display will have 1600 nits max brightness and hdr supports the full p3 color gamut and there's about 2600 local dimming zones for hopefully some really deep inky blacks and sharp high contrast bright scenes but i'm really looking forward to seeing what that mini led ipad pro looks like versus the lcds we've seen but it should be great for things like photo editing whatever video editing you might be doing on the ipad but also especially watching movies because let's face it a lot of movies on ipads have the black bars at the top and the bottom those should be even darker since pixels are off even more inky blacks when watching movies so should be a pretty good upgrade i'm just super curious if we're actually going to notice a performance difference between the a12z and the m1 chip in an ipad pro i mean it's it's just ipad os at the end of the day and it's going to be doing processing and maybe those types of compilation times are faster but will battery life be better the ipad pro actually has a bigger battery than the macbook airs but you know it's 120 hertz display so it balances out i don't know we'll have to test we'll have to see but hey at the end of the day even if this thing is nuclear powerful it's still an ipad so it's going to be amazing at all the things that ipads were already pretty good at but also just as limited so i mean this there's nothing i'd like more than to try final cut pro on a small 3k touchscreen with an m1 chip but i can't because ipad but hey at least good on apple for not resting on their 30 million light year lead on performance specifically in tablets but yeah that's basically it those are the three big new bullet points there was also some other small stuff announced at this event there's a new apple tv 4k and there's also a new remote for the apple tv which is nice there's also a new purple iphone 12. so mid cycle refresh stuff honestly i probably will end up making a video on that we'll see but those are the those are the main things and my reactions and my thoughts to them anyway let me know in the comments what you guys think of the announcements but specifically do you also think the new imac is as ugly as i do because i seriously anyway uh there's a lot of other hands-on and more videos on this sort of stuff coming up so if you want to see that if you want to see air tags in action if you want to see a purple iphone but if you want to see the new ipad pros and m1 imacs be sure to subscribe so you can be first in line to see that stuff hit the bell even while you're down there

have the ultra ipad pro and of course we have the ultra slender slender imac the new 24 inch imac which imac the new 24 inch imac which comes in like a wild number of colors comes in like a wild number of colors the unit i have in front of me here is the unit i have in front of me here is in the blue in the blue which i think is the most popular color which i think is the most popular color anyway i'm curious to check it out anyway i'm curious to check it out let's kick it off with actually one of let's kick it off with actually one of the smaller items the smaller items this apple tv i actually use apple tv this apple tv i actually use apple tv a lot i have maybe four of these set up a lot i have maybe four of these set up at my house different locations well the at my house different locations well the old model old model and apple finally made some improvements and apple finally made some improvements here here that uh might just save my life because that uh might just save my life because uh the remote on the current model has uh the remote on the current model has kind of drove me crazy a little bit like kind of drove me crazy a little bit like it's just with the touch pad and it's just with the touch pad and it's very easy to lose this one is still it's very easy to lose this one is still easy to lose but they just easy to lose but they just they changed it they made a little bit they changed it they made a little bit taller they changed the input method taller they changed the input method also we have 4k hdr on here you have the also we have 4k hdr on here you have the tv calibration stuff tv calibration stuff uh look at this a little advertising on uh look at this a little advertising on the back for disney plus netflix the back for disney plus netflix the competitors of course starting with the competitors of course starting with apple tv plus airplay is a nice thing to apple tv plus airplay is a nice thing to have from your other apple devices it have from your other apple devices it works really well works really well uh onto your apple tv if you have any of uh onto your apple tv if you have any of their audio products as well like the their audio products as well like the homepod i don't have any of those i do homepod i don't have any of those i do have airpods well anyway have airpods well anyway those things interact well also so this those things interact well also so this comes in comes in two different storage configurations two different storage configurations this is the 64 gigabyte model this is an this is the 64 gigabyte model this is an expensive expensive streaming device it's kind of streaming device it's kind of unnecessary unless you're going to take unnecessary unless you're going to take advantage of some of that airplay stuff advantage of some of that airplay stuff because otherwise you could because otherwise you could look at the likes of roku and such that look at the likes of roku and such that have more budget friendly have more budget friendly options but this is going to have your options but this is going to have your typical apple finish and integration to typical apple finish and integration to it it here is the apple tv itself here is the apple tv itself that is a very nice you see there's no that is a very nice you see there's no peel like that on the roku that's a peel like that on the roku that's a that's like a couple hundred dollar peel that's like a couple hundred dollar peel right there as far as i'm concerned right there as far as i'm concerned actually the back of it it all looks actually the back of it it all looks very similar we have our power very similar we have our power port an hdmi port and then you have uh port an hdmi port and then you have uh for wired networking you have an for wired networking you have an ethernet port as well another peel for ethernet port as well another peel for you you oh yeah it's very nice and that's really oh yeah it's very nice and that's really what you're paying for right there you what you're paying for right there you get big apple logo right down there so get big apple logo right down there so glossy black on the outside matte black glossy black on the outside matte black on the top this is what i am most on the top this is what i am most curious about the new remote so it is curious about the new remote so it is fatter fatter imagine that apple making a product imagine that apple making a product fatter not fatter not slimmer and it's more robust to hold on slimmer and it's more robust to hold on to to it's uh confidence inspiring dare i say it's uh confidence inspiring dare i say you have your microphone button over you have your microphone button over here on the side a dedicated power here on the side a dedicated power button button up at the top uh you have almost an ipod up at the top uh you have almost an ipod like like click wheel situation going on so still click wheel situation going on so still touch sensitive but touch sensitive but just different than the pad that they just different than the pad that they currently have currently have and then your key buttons are over here and then your key buttons are over here as well for volume as well for volume a mute switch and a back button it still a mute switch and a back button it still charges over lightning so you're gonna charges over lightning so you're gonna have to have these cables around have to have these cables around and accessible that's a little bit and accessible that's a little bit annoying but that's how they do it annoying but that's how they do it and some were surprised that this remote and some were surprised that this remote didn't didn't feature any tracking similar to air tags feature any tracking similar to air tags or air tag integration or air tag integration because these are things that get because these are things that get misplaced quite frequently uh i'm misplaced quite frequently uh i'm actually actually considering with the later case brand to considering with the later case brand to maybe make something for this remote maybe make something for this remote to make it trackable i'm not committing to make it trackable i'm not committing to that but i'm gonna look into it to that but i'm gonna look into it either way it's already an improvement i either way it's already an improvement i think it's going to be tougher to lose think it's going to be tougher to lose just because it's just because it's fatter anyway also in the package we fatter anyway also in the package we have have uh what is this that's your power cable uh what is this that's your power cable right there right there and do they give you a lightning cable and do they give you a lightning cable or they just expect oh they do okay so or they just expect oh they do okay so you get a usb to lightning cable you get a usb to lightning cable couldn't remember if they expected you couldn't remember if they expected you to have that and that's just going to be to have that and that's just going to be used to charge up used to charge up the remote all right now since this is the remote all right now since this is an unboxing an unboxing extravaganza it is time for us to move extravaganza it is time for us to move on to our next item on to our next item i think i'm gonna go to the magic i think i'm gonna go to the magic keyboard keyboard the new magic keyboard this one was kind the new magic keyboard this one was kind of a controversial item because of a controversial item because apple came out and said hey if you have apple came out and said hey if you have the old uh 12.9 inch the old uh 12.9 inch magic keyboard from the last generation magic keyboard from the last generation ipad pro ipad pro then the new ipad pro if you upgrade to then the new ipad pro if you upgrade to this one right here this one right here it's crazy that this boxes they feel it's crazy that this boxes they feel like they're the same way like they're the same way if you pick up the new ipad pro because if you pick up the new ipad pro because you want a new display and you want a new display and m1 chip and all that you're gonna need a m1 chip and all that you're gonna need a new magic keyboard as well because new magic keyboard as well because it doesn't really work on the old one it doesn't really work on the old one people were like what are you talking people were like what are you talking about i spent so much money on the old about i spent so much money on the old magic i got to upgrade both every single magic i got to upgrade both every single time time yes in order to accommodate this new yes in order to accommodate this new display it got ever so slightly fatter display it got ever so slightly fatter enough so to throw off the tolerances on enough so to throw off the tolerances on the previous the previous version of the magic keyboard that's version of the magic keyboard that's what this one here aims to fix what this one here aims to fix it also comes in white so it's a little it also comes in white so it's a little bit annoying i saw some people saying it bit annoying i saw some people saying it kind of does work but it's just when you kind of does work but it's just when you close it close it everything the fit and finish is not everything the fit and finish is not quite there if you use the quite there if you use the new ipad pro 12.9 with the old magic new ipad pro 12.9 with the old magic keyboard keyboard what this does is it kind of gives you a what this does is it kind of gives you a laptop like experience laptop like experience with your ipad pro this one on the other with your ipad pro this one on the other hand looks like it'll work with third hand looks like it'll work with third fourth and fifth generation so this this fourth and fifth generation so this this is the more is the more accommodating version it will be accommodating version it will be backwards compatible because it has a backwards compatible because it has a little bit more room to work with little bit more room to work with now the one thing i should mention now the one thing i should mention because i've i tried to go because i've i tried to go ipad only ditch the laptop ipad only ditch the laptop by the time you get the keyboard case by the time you get the keyboard case and everything going and everything going it can get surprisingly heavy like it can get surprisingly heavy like beyond beyond macbook air territory and so that's macbook air territory and so that's something to just prepare yourself for something to just prepare yourself for you are no longer you are no longer ipad light once you've added this ipad light once you've added this particular component but particular component but if you need touch input if you love if you need touch input if you love having an ipad and you want a keyboard having an ipad and you want a keyboard to sort of give you the uh laptop like to sort of give you the uh laptop like experience well this is experience well this is a way to do it this white looks nice a way to do it this white looks nice right now right now i'm a little bit concerned long term i'm a little bit concerned long term because it looks so clean oh so clean at because it looks so clean oh so clean at the moment the moment can it stay looking oh so clean i don't can it stay looking oh so clean i don't know all right so it has a couple know all right so it has a couple different different a couple different positions to be and i a couple different positions to be and i guess really only two guess really only two that's open that's closed the ipad will that's open that's closed the ipad will fit fit on the inside of it this little section on the inside of it this little section here you plug in here you plug in usb type c the metallic connectors here usb type c the metallic connectors here will make sure to pass will make sure to pass power onto the ipad itself power onto the ipad itself it's a chiclet style keyboard there is a it's a chiclet style keyboard there is a track pad there track pad there little trackpad the quick little trackpad the quick brown fox now because it's laying flat brown fox now because it's laying flat on the table on the table it's got a pretty sturdy feel to it you it's got a pretty sturdy feel to it you don't get any don't get any type of angle typing angle it's type of angle typing angle it's very flat but because it's so thin very flat but because it's so thin it means your palms can kind of rest on it means your palms can kind of rest on the table and not the table and not feel any type of harsh edge so that's a feel any type of harsh edge so that's a nice little thing nice little thing cool so silver it's got some silver and cool so silver it's got some silver and some white how is the bottom of this not some white how is the bottom of this not gonna get messed up though let me place gonna get messed up though let me place that down on the table that down on the table i don't know i feel like it's got to at i don't know i feel like it's got to at some point all right let's leave that some point all right let's leave that there for a moment and get on to there for a moment and get on to the ipad itself so the m1 chip makes its the ipad itself so the m1 chip makes its debut debut in an ipad and obviously from a in an ipad and obviously from a performance standpoint this thing is performance standpoint this thing is going to be on another level going to be on another level you're talking about the same chip that you're talking about the same chip that you're seeing in all those macbooks that you're seeing in all those macbooks that people are loving people are loving and surprised by the performance and surprised by the performance associated now you're seeing it in the associated now you're seeing it in the ipad the other big thing here is the ipad the other big thing here is the display display it's now got all these little dimming it's now got all these little dimming local dimming sections attempting to local dimming sections attempting to mimic oled performance mimic oled performance and actually before i even get into this and actually before i even get into this box there's some people that are box there's some people that are saying it's not quite on that oled level saying it's not quite on that oled level they're seeing blooming they're seeing blooming and things like this but that's for the and things like this but that's for the pixel peeping at a later date pixel peeping at a later date either way uh probably a stopover either way uh probably a stopover technology for apple they technology for apple they i would assume they're gonna get to oled i would assume they're gonna get to oled at some point okay so at some point okay so here is the ipad pro 12.9 here is the ipad pro 12.9 this is the space gray color this is the space gray color i mean if you've seen the ipad pro i mean if you've seen the ipad pro incredibly thin and light incredibly thin and light this one doesn't feel any fatter to me this one doesn't feel any fatter to me that goes to show you just how that goes to show you just how small those differences are one of the small those differences are one of the things i like about this tablet things i like about this tablet is the multimedia performance for me is the multimedia performance for me just sitting back just sitting back watching content they put a lot of watching content they put a lot of attention into the speaker performance attention into the speaker performance which you don't see all the time in which you don't see all the time in crazy slim crazy slim and thin devices but this one actually and thin devices but this one actually sounds good to sounds good to watch content for extended periods of watch content for extended periods of time you have obviously your time you have obviously your pen input can live up there if you want pen input can live up there if you want to or a pencil if you want to use the to or a pencil if you want to use the apple pencil apple pencil we have our camera unit over here apple we have our camera unit over here apple making making all sorts of conversation around the ar all sorts of conversation around the ar future future utilizing their camera units oh usb type utilizing their camera units oh usb type c c connector thank goodness something to connector thank goodness something to remind you one of the few remind you one of the few devices the ipad pro supporting usb type devices the ipad pro supporting usb type c from apple at least mobile devices i c from apple at least mobile devices i guess the laptops do guess the laptops do all right also inside the package a all right also inside the package a little bit of paperwork little bit of paperwork here's your power brick as well as your here's your power brick as well as your type c type c to c cable to charge it up very nice let to c cable to charge it up very nice let me boot this up real quick i want to me boot this up real quick i want to check out this display check out this display it should be more vibrant no doubt about it should be more vibrant no doubt about that oh another thing i should mention that oh another thing i should mention at this point at this point this is the 12.9 inch model it got the this is the 12.9 inch model it got the new display but the 11 inch model new display but the 11 inch model which i've probably used more at this which i've probably used more at this point did not get point did not get the new display so it's still the old the new display so it's still the old technology old ips technology old ips technology though based on some of the technology though based on some of the uh reports i'm seeing with this blooming uh reports i'm seeing with this blooming stuff maybe some people are gonna opt stuff maybe some people are gonna opt for the old tech i don't see any for the old tech i don't see any problems with it now problems with it now the way to experience the effect some the way to experience the effect some are complaining about is on a black are complaining about is on a black background with a bright some bright background with a bright some bright text or something that's how many are text or something that's how many are picking up on it but you kind of need picking up on it but you kind of need the right conditions to see it the right conditions to see it we'll get there in a moment all right we'll get there in a moment all right let's do a purple iphone real quick why let's do a purple iphone real quick why don't we do don't we do the standard purple iphone 12 since the standard purple iphone 12 since we're covering we're covering so much ground now i'm going to keep so much ground now i'm going to keep this this package nice and tidy for someone who package nice and tidy for someone who might win this purple iphone might win this purple iphone because i'm going to give this one away because i'm going to give this one away oh wow that that is a very oh wow that that is a very it's hard what is it like a lavender it's hard what is it like a lavender thing going on it's a thing going on it's a lighter purple as far as purples go of lighter purple as far as purples go of course you have purple around the frame course you have purple around the frame as well this is a bit darker the as well this is a bit darker the metallic portion and then you have this metallic portion and then you have this pastel style purple pastel style purple over here i think i mean it's kind of a over here i think i mean it's kind of a nice look to it it's nice look to it it's noteworthy because apple wouldn't noteworthy because apple wouldn't normally uh take a moment normally uh take a moment at a different product launch and be at a different product launch and be like oh yeah we got an iphone in another like oh yeah we got an iphone in another color color i suppose they've done that sort of with i suppose they've done that sort of with the red stuff in the past but just hey the red stuff in the past but just hey we got purple check out our purple we got purple check out our purple anyway anyway that's the purple if you were curious that's the purple if you were curious inside the package inside the package type c to lightning and well you know type c to lightning and well you know the story you know charge brick no nada the story you know charge brick no nada but somebody is actually gonna win this but somebody is actually gonna win this so so good luck to those of you playing all good luck to those of you playing all the subscribers out there who want a the subscribers out there who want a shot at it make sure to leave your shot at it make sure to leave your twitter handle down in the comments and twitter handle down in the comments and make sure to subscribe to the channel make sure to subscribe to the channel i have two of them to give away one i have two of them to give away one purple 12 1 purple 12 1 purple 12 mini all right i think it's purple 12 mini all right i think it's about time about time in this extravaganza to make our way to in this extravaganza to make our way to the biggest unit the biggest unit baby the new imac which is baby the new imac which is well it's uh quite a departure from the well it's uh quite a departure from the old one this is old one this is the newest item of the new items i the newest item of the new items i haven't haven't used an imac extensively in a while but used an imac extensively in a while but i'm very familiar with them i'm very familiar with them i've used them in the past i used to i've used them in the past i used to repair them i used to upgrade them in repair them i used to upgrade them in previous businesses previous businesses so i do have a history with imax so i do have a history with imax this is the first time it's one size this is the first time it's one size fits all there used to be a big one and fits all there used to be a big one and a small one maybe they'll do a pro a small one maybe they'll do a pro version version eventually but for now it's 24 inches eventually but for now it's 24 inches you can see you can see the thunderbolt ports as well as the the thunderbolt ports as well as the type c ports very type c ports very simple i o over here there is simple i o over here there is a ethernet port but it is on the power a ethernet port but it is on the power brick brick portion of the power cable that's right portion of the power cable that's right there is a brick it's no longer there is a brick it's no longer integrated integrated another topic of conversation i saw my another topic of conversation i saw my pal detroit borg talking about that how pal detroit borg talking about that how he would rather have an integrated power he would rather have an integrated power supply but this thing is so crazy supply but this thing is so crazy slim so i'm sure that had something to slim so i'm sure that had something to do with it i don't need a knife because do with it i don't need a knife because we have we have the famous pull tab here we go you ready the famous pull tab here we go you ready mo mo ooh that is very satisfying now again ooh that is very satisfying now again this is the blue model but it comes in this is the blue model but it comes in about a thousand colors about a thousand colors oh i don't know they're silver there's oh i don't know they're silver there's orange orange there's yellow there's so many different there's yellow there's so many different colors actually this is colors actually this is supposed to open up the other way oh supposed to open up the other way oh that's the other item that many are that's the other item that many are mentioning mentioning the chin the no logo chin i i mean the chin the no logo chin i i mean people were surprised by they say okay people were surprised by they say okay why you got a chin first of all it's why you got a chin first of all it's 2021 2021 your apple and then second of all if your apple and then second of all if you're gonna have the chin where's the you're gonna have the chin where's the apple logo we're used to seeing it apple logo we're used to seeing it i think in it with this device they kind i think in it with this device they kind of did the opposite of what they did of did the opposite of what they did with the remote with the remote on the remote they're like okay let's on the remote they're like okay let's make it fatter we don't care it can be make it fatter we don't care it can be fatter it's fine this one fatter it's fine this one was like let's compromise whatever was like let's compromise whatever necessary in order to make it as slim as necessary in order to make it as slim as possible possible i should probably check the spec on this i should probably check the spec on this eight core cpu eight core gpu eight core cpu eight core gpu uh agb unified memory and 512 storage i uh agb unified memory and 512 storage i think that's the base model think that's the base model you can spec it higher or you can wait you can spec it higher or you can wait for the pro one because they'll probably for the pro one because they'll probably do that do that if you plan on video editing or and if you plan on video editing or and whatnot all right whatnot all right holy big box going on oh holy big box going on oh cool see the way that happened there cool see the way that happened there this is the closed position i pull here this is the closed position i pull here and it triggers the movement of those and it triggers the movement of those other pieces other pieces bang bang oh man it's like a giant bang bang oh man it's like a giant ipad on a stick i think i said that on ipad on a stick i think i said that on an episode of lou later it actually an episode of lou later it actually that's exactly what it is it's a giant that's exactly what it is it's a giant ipad on a stick ipad on a stick just i could just like a little just i could just like a little briefcase briefcase it's not that light though it's tiny but it's not that light though it's tiny but a lot of metallic components it feels a lot of metallic components it feels substantial substantial all right also in the package ooh look all right also in the package ooh look at the accessories in here at the accessories in here color match keyboard typical apple color match keyboard typical apple styling styling but now we have the fingerprint scanner but now we have the fingerprint scanner so white keys so white keys on a bluish aluminum bluish on a bluish aluminum bluish backing very slim charging over backing very slim charging over lightning once again let me just crack lightning once again let me just crack into this right now why don't i into this right now why don't i kind of nice to have the touch id right kind of nice to have the touch id right on the keyboard on the keyboard people on the desktop feeling left out people on the desktop feeling left out everybody unlocking their computers on everybody unlocking their computers on the laptops just with the fingerprint the laptops just with the fingerprint okay now we can do that there okay now we can do that there that's a nice little touch ooh look at that's a nice little touch ooh look at the stylish the stylish cables as well just pop that out braided cables as well just pop that out braided usbc to lightning i guess it's for this usbc to lightning i guess it's for this it matches the whole motif it matches the whole motif very nice same goes for the power cable very nice same goes for the power cable now now as mentioned they had to put the power as mentioned they had to put the power brick onto brick onto the outside they weren't able to fit it the outside they weren't able to fit it into the actual construction in order to into the actual construction in order to keep it super slim but the benefit there keep it super slim but the benefit there i don't even know am i in the camera i don't even know am i in the camera right now i'm just talking am i anywhere right now i'm just talking am i anywhere my head's cut off right okay i should my head's cut off right okay i should probably just get this stuff off here probably just get this stuff off here this this this look at this is like this this this look at this is like a mastery of product packaging a little a mastery of product packaging a little slot for everything just slot for everything just folding paper in magical ways folding paper in magical ways [Music] [Music] lovely i think i got everything out of lovely i think i got everything out of that package that package now before i get to the main unit i just now before i get to the main unit i just want to cover all of the accessories want to cover all of the accessories your apple stickers are in here your apple stickers are in here the cable that i mentioned am i supposed the cable that i mentioned am i supposed to just rip it to just rip it it's like a baby blue north carolina it's like a baby blue north carolina tar heels type look to it the mouse is tar heels type look to it the mouse is also also i don't use i don't ever use these but i don't use i don't ever use these but certainly stylish the power cable okay certainly stylish the power cable okay let's talk a little bit more about the let's talk a little bit more about the power cable power brick power cable power brick so to make the device super slender you so to make the device super slender you got to put the power brick on the got to put the power brick on the outside outside that's a hotly debated topic that's a hotly debated topic but apple did something interesting but apple did something interesting with this they were able to integrate with this they were able to integrate an ethernet jack so that you can still an ethernet jack so that you can still have a wired have a wired internet connection which many people internet connection which many people with a desktop with a desktop want and you can have it on the floor so want and you can have it on the floor so you have fewer cables going up you have fewer cables going up to your unit so that's kind of a nice to your unit so that's kind of a nice little touch they also little touch they also created this magnetic connector so if it created this magnetic connector so if it was to get kicked was to get kicked uh it would pop out presumably uh i uh it would pop out presumably uh i don't know i'll give it a little test don't know i'll give it a little test i'll give it a little run i'll give it a little run see if that's how it works that seems see if that's how it works that seems less important less important on a desktop compared to a laptop where on a desktop compared to a laptop where we've seen magsafe before but who knows we've seen magsafe before but who knows where people are gonna where people are gonna set these up it's a nice little thing to set these up it's a nice little thing to have in the event that that happens and have in the event that that happens and you don't have to watch your imac slam you don't have to watch your imac slam to the ground but yes to the ground but yes to get something that thin you got to to get something that thin you got to have a power brick on the outside it's have a power brick on the outside it's uh that's just the nature of the thing uh that's just the nature of the thing at the moment there's also an extension at the moment there's also an extension cable included cable included so you can get a little bit further away so you can get a little bit further away from the wall this is standardized even from the wall this is standardized even though apple's though apple's is a little bit flashy standardized is a little bit flashy standardized three pin connector three pin connector into here so you get a little more room into here so you get a little more room to work with okay to work with okay so here is the new imac as so here is the new imac as mentioned behold the slenderness of it mentioned behold the slenderness of it all all it's more unboxing it's more unboxing discovery here we pull those tabs and discovery here we pull those tabs and then we pull down then we pull down and then we pull up and it all unfolds and then we pull up and it all unfolds wow okay wow okay there's a giant apple logo on the back there's a giant apple logo on the back so so certainly we're missing it on the front certainly we're missing it on the front but we get it on the back this is a this but we get it on the back this is a this is a peel is a peel this is definitely this qualifies as this is definitely this qualifies as appeal appeal wow that is strange in person wow that is strange in person logo list front is a bit of a shock to logo list front is a bit of a shock to the system if you've ever looked at an the system if you've ever looked at an imac before imac before there's usually a giant logo there i there's usually a giant logo there i didn't expect it to be noticeable to me didn't expect it to be noticeable to me now i'm actually not going to complain now i'm actually not going to complain about i kind of like the minimal about i kind of like the minimal approach to it but the chin does feel a approach to it but the chin does feel a little strange it has the color has the little strange it has the color has the the baby blue but then you have the the baby blue but then you have the remainder with this white bezel remainder with this white bezel it's kind of a funny look but the it's kind of a funny look but the takeaway for me is takeaway for me is more around the physical characteristics more around the physical characteristics the dimensions the dimensions than it is around any individual color than it is around any individual color just how i mean like let me just hold up just how i mean like let me just hold up this is an ipad pro the new 12.9 this is an ipad pro the new 12.9 if i hold that up i mean you can see it if i hold that up i mean you can see it ain't all that different ain't all that different it's not it's probably two two of these it's not it's probably two two of these max it's very slim max it's very slim for an entire desktop computer it's for an entire desktop computer it's slimmer than i think any monitor i own slimmer than i think any monitor i own at the moment at the moment and it's got an m1 in there and it's got an m1 in there i don't know exactly what that was i don't know exactly what that was protecting and then i got more plastic protecting and then i got more plastic over here over here and now we see the true blue coloring and now we see the true blue coloring that's a very nice blue that's a very nice blue you know what i can get i can get behind you know what i can get i can get behind that blue that is a dark it's a deep that blue that is a dark it's a deep it's a dark and a deep blue oh and look it's a dark and a deep blue oh and look at this another pull tab around the at this another pull tab around the outside outside many poles many poles all very nicely protected all very nicely protected oh that was close oh that was close all right so as far as ports it's just all right so as far as ports it's just four type c connectors two of them four type c connectors two of them thunderbolt would be nice to see a thunderbolt would be nice to see a little bit of versatility i don't know little bit of versatility i don't know maybe maybe sd card slot something like that but sd card slot something like that but anyway anyway simple approach large power button over simple approach large power button over here let's here let's check out this magnetic connector check out this magnetic connector oh that's it how easily does it come out oh that's it how easily does it come out [Music] [Music] not that easily so i do not think it's a not that easily so i do not think it's a kick factor kick factor at all that's a strong at all that's a strong magnet magnet it's definitely not a kick factor oh my it's definitely not a kick factor oh my goodness gracious that is a goodness gracious that is a it's a strong magnet they did in there it's a strong magnet they did in there i'll tell you what there's a strong i'll tell you what there's a strong magnet they did in there magnet they did in there so it's just a convenience thing i so it's just a convenience thing i suppose because of the way you have this suppose because of the way you have this small cable gap novelty of small cable gap novelty of magnetic connection points they could magnetic connection points they could have probably just done a bet some sort have probably just done a bet some sort of barrel connector it would have been of barrel connector it would have been possible possible but this is certainly more fun but this is certainly more fun especially when it's color matched especially when it's color matched oh and they also reworked the oh and they also reworked the front-facing camera they've uh front-facing camera they've uh they claimed to have better video they claimed to have better video conferencing which is an area that's conferencing which is an area that's kind of lagged previously so kind of lagged previously so people are doing a lot more of that you people are doing a lot more of that you can see the microphone array up on the can see the microphone array up on the top over there as well top over there as well very deep blue certainly all right so i very deep blue certainly all right so i went went and collected some older versions of and collected some older versions of these refresh products in order to do a these refresh products in order to do a quick comparison quick comparison see if i could spot the differences uh see if i could spot the differences uh well obviously with the remote it's well obviously with the remote it's pretty easy to spot the differences now pretty easy to spot the differences now this is the thing i had to do this is the thing i had to do back in the olden days actually i still back in the olden days actually i still do this to this day i put this do this to this day i put this super flimsy cheap case onto super flimsy cheap case onto the apple tv remote so it's slightly the apple tv remote so it's slightly less likely to get lost because in my less likely to get lost because in my house it's madness there's many people house it's madness there's many people in there they do what they want in there they do what they want and then i got to go hunt this thing and then i got to go hunt this thing down and i got kind of got sick of that down and i got kind of got sick of that so i purchased this thing so i purchased this thing off amazon but it's not the most fun to off amazon but it's not the most fun to hold on to and it actually doesn't hold on to and it actually doesn't really really fit the remote all that well but this fit the remote all that well but this makes it fatter makes it fatter so it can't slide between the cushions so it can't slide between the cushions as much and i think this one as much and i think this one also glows in the dark but it obviously also glows in the dark but it obviously removes removes the aesthetic of the thing now apple the aesthetic of the thing now apple went ahead and just made theirs fatter went ahead and just made theirs fatter so it's almost so it's almost as fat as this one in the case now as fat as this one in the case now and i'm sure part of that has to do i and i'm sure part of that has to do i mean it's not the components taking up mean it's not the components taking up the space i'm sure part of that has to the space i'm sure part of that has to do with people do with people requesting such a thing and maybe the requesting such a thing and maybe the battery life is a little bit better but battery life is a little bit better but anyway that's your i'm gonna take this anyway that's your i'm gonna take this back out that's your design difference back out that's your design difference this thing was just this thing was just crazy slender so taller fatter crazy slender so taller fatter maybe ever so slightly more slender but maybe ever so slightly more slender but a much bigger remote now the more a much bigger remote now the more important comparison here important comparison here is right in front of me this is the new is right in front of me this is the new 12.9 inch 12.9 inch m1 ipad pro and the comparison the m1 ipad pro and the comparison the closest comparison i had was the closest comparison i had was the previous generation 11 inch previous generation 11 inch accessible to me at the moment uh this accessible to me at the moment uh this is the 11 inch ipad pro previous gen is the 11 inch ipad pro previous gen though they kept the same display though they kept the same display technology technology into the current generation 11 inch that into the current generation 11 inch that one did not get the mini led technology one did not get the mini led technology so this is ips versus so this is ips versus a mini led and for all the a mini led and for all the i mean it's not even a controversy for i mean it's not even a controversy for all the conversation around the blooming all the conversation around the blooming uh aspect defect the thing that people uh aspect defect the thing that people don't like about the don't like about the uh performance on the mini led or at uh performance on the mini led or at least they've been pointing out on a least they've been pointing out on a black background black background it is a superior technology from a it is a superior technology from a contrast perspective contrast perspective i don't know if you can see it but to my i don't know if you can see it but to my eyes eyes this is more contrasty it almost feels this is more contrasty it almost feels like oled like oled now the only potential for problem that now the only potential for problem that occurs is when you occurs is when you launch into something that happens to launch into something that happens to have a really have a really dark area pressed right up against a dark area pressed right up against a very bright area very bright area now what happened on the old tech now what happened on the old tech because you had because you had fewer dimming zones is you would get a fewer dimming zones is you would get a kind of kind of grayishness to the entire grayishness to the entire black background near a particular black background near a particular section section in this case people were noticing a glow in this case people were noticing a glow around around individual areas almost like a spotlight individual areas almost like a spotlight sort of glow effect sort of glow effect now this is emphasized when you have the now this is emphasized when you have the lights off if you're like watching a lights off if you're like watching a movie or something you can see here it's movie or something you can see here it's not really not really all that prevalent is it a little bit all that prevalent is it a little bit nitpicky yeah to a certain extent nitpicky yeah to a certain extent i understand these things are expensive i understand these things are expensive everyone has a different take on everyone has a different take on how much that is going to impact or how much that is going to impact or affect them it's not oled affect them it's not oled but i can tell you just based on this but i can tell you just based on this brief comparison brief comparison it looks a lot more like oled from a it looks a lot more like oled from a contrast perspective contrast perspective and even with that blooming aspect for and even with that blooming aspect for my use my use i still would probably prefer it over i still would probably prefer it over the old tech the old ips display which the old tech the old ips display which is just lacking a little bit of vibrance is just lacking a little bit of vibrance oled would be awesome maybe uh maybe oled would be awesome maybe uh maybe next time around next time around oh by the way i should mention i don't oh by the way i should mention i don't know if i mentioned this the know if i mentioned this the keyboard case situation another topic of keyboard case situation another topic of conversation because the magic keyboard conversation because the magic keyboard for the ipad pro apple said hey it for the ipad pro apple said hey it doesn't really work with the old version doesn't really work with the old version of the magic keyboard case of the magic keyboard case for the previous generation 12.9 i for the previous generation 12.9 i happen to have the old version over here happen to have the old version over here i don't know if they clarified later on i don't know if they clarified later on they say well it will work but it's not they say well it will work but it's not exactly perfect exactly perfect it's pretty close to perfect now i can't it's pretty close to perfect now i can't speak to whether or not it's a speak to whether or not it's a safe thing to do with your ipad it safe thing to do with your ipad it doesn't quite doesn't quite click exactly as well it's click exactly as well it's very tight tolerances and this thing got very tight tolerances and this thing got ever so slightly fatter ever so slightly fatter but look at it in the old keyboard case but look at it in the old keyboard case i mean i mean it's in there i don't know if people are it's in there i don't know if people are gonna feel compelled to buy a whole new gonna feel compelled to buy a whole new keyboard case as well when it's just keyboard case as well when it's just slightly less precise on the fit slightly less precise on the fit but i'll just show you the difference so but i'll just show you the difference so that one it clicks down with a little that one it clicks down with a little bit bit less attitude with a little bit less less attitude with a little bit less clamp clamp this one is just ever so slightly this one is just ever so slightly tighter tighter it's very subtle but anyways it's worth it's very subtle but anyways it's worth noting noting if you're in the market also this white if you're in the market also this white one is kind of terrifying to me i'm one is kind of terrifying to me i'm starting to realize that as i slap it starting to realize that as i slap it down on different surfaces down on different surfaces i can't imagine how this is going to i can't imagine how this is going to stay this color stay this color but funny enough even if you look at the but funny enough even if you look at the old darker color it's all kinds of wear old darker color it's all kinds of wear marks and stuff i really wish apple marks and stuff i really wish apple would put little feet would put little feet on the bottom of this keyboard case for on the bottom of this keyboard case for durability purposes but durability purposes but i i presume they went for slimness at i i presume they went for slimness at all costs all costs okay the last major piece of hardware okay the last major piece of hardware here we have is the new imac here we have is the new imac this is truly a style piece some have this is truly a style piece some have called it a style icon called it a style icon that's what kirk said it's a super slim that's what kirk said it's a super slim nice nice little desktop with a tremendous amount little desktop with a tremendous amount of horsepower considering how of horsepower considering how tiny it is i mean it was the same thing tiny it is i mean it was the same thing we could say about the macbook air we could say about the macbook air current generation macbook pro even the current generation macbook pro even the current mac mini anything with m1 in it current mac mini anything with m1 in it it's it's just it's wild what they're it's it's just it's wild what they're able to pull out of it in these able to pull out of it in these super slim form factors i was thinking super slim form factors i was thinking of mounting of mounting mounting this up mostly as a monitor mounting this up mostly as a monitor just because just because i mean it's hard to even find a monitor i mean it's hard to even find a monitor that's this slim and then you start to that's this slim and then you start to look at the prices look at the prices i'm not gonna lie i didn't pay a lot of i'm not gonna lie i didn't pay a lot of attention to this imac i wasn't really attention to this imac i wasn't really in the market for it outside of this in the market for it outside of this channel and making this video channel and making this video but when you start to compare it to but when you start to compare it to other other displays that are that are as pixel displays that are that are as pixel dense as this and have dense as this and have no computer and have no m1 inside you're no computer and have no m1 inside you're like oh my goodness like oh my goodness you've got an lg product over a thousand you've got an lg product over a thousand dollars for a 5k display dollars for a 5k display at 27 inches now this is not quite 5k at 27 inches now this is not quite 5k but it's very close to 5k but it's very close to 5k and it's in 24 inches so we've gathered and it's in 24 inches so we've gathered around we're looking at it around we're looking at it like damn that's some that's a pretty like damn that's some that's a pretty dense display over there it's pretty dense display over there it's pretty nice to look at i'll tell you what nice to look at i'll tell you what it is compelling almost from the display it is compelling almost from the display standpoint alone standpoint alone it is a very nice display experience uh it is a very nice display experience uh it's still a tough purchase it's still a tough purchase i think for matter many individuals i i think for matter many individuals i don't know everybody in here for example don't know everybody in here for example because because cost wise you're looking at something cost wise you're looking at something close to any of those laptops and then close to any of those laptops and then you're like well wouldn't you you're like well wouldn't you if you had the same amount of power if you had the same amount of power wouldn't you want something that's wouldn't you want something that's portable portable but the it turns out the conversation but the it turns out the conversation the competition here is actually more the competition here is actually more around display if you want a nice around display if you want a nice display to go with your m1 display to go with your m1 well that's how you get here it's a well that's how you get here it's a little less portable but it's still little less portable but it's still i mean kind of portable it's super it's i mean kind of portable it's super it's one cable into it one cable into it maybe some company's going to engineer a maybe some company's going to engineer a case and then kirk can just like slap case and then kirk can just like slap this in there and and also be editing this in there and and also be editing wherever he goes i remember the old days wherever he goes i remember the old days at ces where some people would actually at ces where some people would actually pack these things up pack these things up would find some sort of specialized bag would find some sort of specialized bag for it because they wanted a bigger for it because they wanted a bigger display to edit on display to edit on once they got to the hotel room so i'm once they got to the hotel room so i'm sure some people can buy these sure some people can buy these uh i say my main takeaway and this brief uh i say my main takeaway and this brief experience with it is uh being surprised experience with it is uh being surprised by the caliber of the display 4480 by the caliber of the display 4480 by 2520 i would say my one by 2520 i would say my one uh i don't want to even i mean it's a uh i don't want to even i mean it's a criticism but it's kind of a foregone criticism but it's kind of a foregone thing like it's obvious this is direct thing like it's obvious this is direct the direction things are going but the direction things are going but i just wish there was like one usb a i just wish there was like one usb a port port just for some old peripherals audio just for some old peripherals audio interfaces all kinds of devices that interfaces all kinds of devices that still exist out there that utilize it still exist out there that utilize it because it's so clean to begin with that because it's so clean to begin with that if you start going with dongles and if you start going with dongles and docks you kind of spoil docks you kind of spoil the product so just i don't know maybe the product so just i don't know maybe one usb-a or even one usb-a or even you've got the ethernet jack down on the you've got the ethernet jack down on the power brick maybe throw usb-a down there power brick maybe throw usb-a down there as well i don't know as well i don't know it's kind of too crazy all right anyway it's kind of too crazy all right anyway the other thing here that's kind of nice the other thing here that's kind of nice to have i still don't know why it's no to have i still don't know why it's no face unlock face unlock because you have the face unlock on the because you have the face unlock on the phone and the ipad and all the other phone and the ipad and all the other products products and windows has the face unlock with the and windows has the face unlock with the windows hello windows hello that'd be really cool for to have a that'd be really cool for to have a couple components there couple components there face id login wonderful stuff anyway face id login wonderful stuff anyway it's not there but we have a fingerprint it's not there but we have a fingerprint scanner which is a bonus scanner which is a bonus and an improvement for a desktop desktop and an improvement for a desktop desktop users feeling left out users feeling left out well now we sleep it well now we sleep it and wake it up and touch id and wake it up and touch id and we're in it's nice i take it and we're in it's nice i take it it's a nice little bonus we go to sleep it's a nice little bonus we go to sleep wake back up touch id or password touch wake back up touch id or password touch id is more convenient id is more convenient and we're unlocked so it's a nice little and we're unlocked so it's a nice little touch touch there you have it it is a mega massive there you have it it is a mega massive apple unboxing video featuring the new apple unboxing video featuring the new delicious imac m1 imac delicious imac m1 imac in blue available in a wide variety of in blue available in a wide variety of colors if blue is not suitable for you colors if blue is not suitable for you we have the new we have the new apple tv that was featured as well with apple tv that was featured as well with the new remote which is the new remote which is somehow maybe the most exciting thing somehow maybe the most exciting thing for me because of how irritating the old for me because of how irritating the old one was so that's kind of nice one was so that's kind of nice obviously there's also the new ipad obviously there's also the new ipad m1 ipad so much power in an ipad no mac m1 ipad so much power in an ipad no mac os os over here but man if you're into ios over here but man if you're into ios this is well or a tablet in general this this is well or a tablet in general this is going to get things done for you is going to get things done for you that's for certain and the display is an that's for certain and the display is an improvement improvement although any any new technologies not although any any new technologies not without its downsides without its downsides we have the white keyboard case as well we have the white keyboard case as well and then don't forget the and then don't forget the purple iphones even the one that i purple iphones even the one that i unboxed

fundamental to how we design and engineer every product and service we put into the world while others have focused on making customers the product collecting ever growing amounts of personal information we've kept the lens focused on how technology can work for people and that's meant introducing countless features that give users transparency and choice over how their data is collected used and shared you see that with new tools like privacy nutrition labels and app tracking transparency which gives users more information more choice and greater transparency about how their data is used we know privacy is a priority for our users in europe and around the world it's why we're always striving to set a higher bar with new tools that put people in the driver's seat when it comes to managing their own data to share more about some of the privacy features our users will see in ios and ipad os 15 here's craig and the team we don't think you should have to make a trade-off between great features and privacy we believe you deserve both since the beginning we've worked to help you keep your personal data under your control and over the years we've integrated powerful privacy controls into our operating systems most recently adding privacy nutrition labels and app tracking transparency today privacy is more important than ever because when you use the internet and third-party apps you can be tracked by a complex ecosystem of data brokers and ad tech firms often without your permission we don't think this is right we believe in protecting your privacy and giving you transparency and control over your information and to tell you about the new ways we're giving you even more control here are katie and eric thanks craig let's start with mail if you're like me you get a lot of marketing emails like this what you may not realize is that many of these emails use invisible pixels to collect information about your mail activity like when you open a message and even your ip address we think you should be able to choose whether to allow this or not so now in the mail app we're introducing mail privacy protection here's what it does it hides your ip address so senders can't link it to your other online activity or determine your location and it prevents senders from seeing if and when you've opened their email so now you can catch up on email with greater peace of mind safari leads the industry in protecting you against cross-site tracking with intelligent tracking prevention and this year we're making it even stronger by also hiding your ip address from trackers so they can't use it to link your activity across different sites or learn your location you can see which trackers are prevented from profiling you in the safari privacy report we wanted to bring this same transparency to apps you use too so we're introducing the app privacy report this new section settings gives you an overview of how apps treat your privacy you can see how often apps use the permission you've granted to access your location photos camera microphone contacts and more during the last seven days and to find out who your data may be shared with you can see all the third-party domains the app is contacting so these are our new privacy system controls now let's talk about siri siri is available across all of your apple devices allowing you to quickly get things done with just your voice and siri is being used more than ever on over 600 million devices each month we recently added more diverse siri voice options and they sound incredible hi i'm siri if you need anything just ask now siri has a ton of great new features this year but today we want to focus on a major update to privacy series designed to process as much data on device as possible keeping your information private and with the power of the neural engine we're able to do this more than ever today we're introducing on-device speech recognition this means that by default your audio is all processed right on your iphone or ipad this addresses the biggest privacy concern we hear for voice assistance which is unwanted audio recording and this has some great benefits beyond privacy first you can now make many requests without an internet connection launch apps change settings control music and more second on-device processing speeds things up check this out i'll do a few requests back to back open photos open calendar turn on airplane mode set a timer for 20 minutes switch to dark mode wake me up at 7 am it's amazing how fast siri is with on-device processing so those are some of the powerful new privacy protections in mail safari and your apps along with on-device speech recognition for siri back to you tim these new privacy features are the latest in a long stream of innovations our teams have developed to improve transparency and put users in control of their data they're features that will help give users peace of mind by strengthening that control and the freedom to use their technology without worrying about who's looking over their shoulder at apple our commitment is to give users choice over how their data is used and to build privacy and security into everything we make thank you and take care you   PRIVACY CHANGES? >> HI, DEIRDRE GREAT TO SEE YOU THANKS FOR HAVING ME, AND HI,  JON. WHAT'S SO IRONIC IS THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GO ANYWHERE THERE'S A LOOPHOLE IN THE WAY  THAT FACEBOOK RUNS THEIR BUSINESS SUCH THAT THEY DON'T  CHARGE INFLUENCERS AND BRAND PARTNERS FOR USING THEIR PLATFORM THEY CAN COME ON FOR FREE. USE THE PLATFORM TO DEVELOP  THEIR IMAGE AND FOLLOWING AND  THEN BRANDS BASICALLY CAN USE  INSTAGRAM AND FACEBOOK AS  COMMUNICATION TOOLS INSTEAD OF AS ADVERTISING TOOLS I MEAN THAT, IN THAT THEY DON'T  ACTUALLY PAY OR HAVE TO PAY  FACEBOOK ANY MONEY SOME BRANDS, FOR EXAMPLE, MY SOURCES TELL ME, LITERALLY THEY  HAVE TO GET ABOUT FIVE XROIs TO  MAKE INSTAGRAM WORTH IT. NOW GETTING TWO. THEY'RE PAYING THEIR BEST  INFLUENCERS ON THEIR FOR FREE  INSTEAD ZERO TO VERY LITTLE  MONEY FOR A MUCH BETTER IRO RATE NOW. >> IS THIS THE NEW GAME PLAN THE NEW BUSINESS MODEL FOR FACEBOOK SEEN THEM LEAN INTO AUDIO IN THAT ECONOMY >> YEAH. I THINK ABSOLUTELY IT HAS TO BE. ONE INTERESTING THING IS TWO YEARS AGO I REMEMBERED THIS  MORNING, WHEN YOU ASKED ME TO  COME ON THE SHOW I WROTE A PIECE ON INFLUENCERS AND HOW WHEN  FACEBOOK HIT LIGHTS IT MIGHT MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO SHOW THEIR RETURNS ON INVESTMENT TO THEIR BRAND PARTNERS WHO THEY  WORK WITH. TURNS OUT THEY'RE STILL ON THE PLATFORM, BUT ACTUALLY I GO ON INSTAGRAM 80 TIMES A DAY CALL IT RESEARCH THEY'RE ASKING A QUESTION  WHETHER PEOPLE LIKE THAT DO YOU LIKE HAVING YOUR LIFE HIDDEN TURNS OUT I DID SPEAK WITH A PSYCH EXPERT SAID PEOPLE LIKE TO TEND WHAT'S ALREADY BEEN LIKED IF YOU GET -- YOU CAN'T SEE HOW  MANY PEOPLE LIKED SOMETHING YOU  MIGHT BE LIKELY TO PASS BY IT. IF YOU SEE IT HAS THOUSANDS OF LIKES YOU MIGHT BE MORE  INTRIGUED, SHOW PEOPLE THAT YOU, TOO, SORT OF LIKE A CROWD THING. IT COULD BE JUST THAT THEY'RE  GOING TO LEAN MORE INTO  INFLUENCERS, AND COULD CHARGE  THEM EASILY AT THIS POINT. HONESTLY, INFLUENCERS MAKE THEIR WHOLE BUSINESS ON FACEBOOK IF THEY CHARGE A NOMINAL FEE,  MILLIONS OF INFLUENCERS AND  COULD DO QUITE WELL. >> OR FLEE TO YOUTUBE OR OTHERS  WHERE, NATASHA, BRINGS US TO THE ISSUE OF ANTITRUST AND THESE COMPANIES CALLED MONOPOI MONOPOLIES I CAN'T HELP BUT MENTION APPLE IS PRESSURING NOW FACEBOOK CUTTING OFF AD MARKETING CAPABILITIES AND JUST TALKING TO MICROSOFT PRESSURING APPLE ON  THE APP STORE MARGINS, I THINK SAYING NOT TAKING 30% TAKE AND PUSHING TO TAKE OVER GAMING, AND AS A PRETTY BIG COMPANY, APPLE HAS TO PAY ATTENTION, I THINK. DOES THIS SHIFT, A NARRATIVE,  ALL COMPANIES AND MONOPOLIES CAN'T BE STOPPED BY ANYTHING BUT INCREASED REGULATION >> WELL, I MEAN, I THINK, YEAH THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE AN IMPACT  ON EACH OTHER, GIVEN HOW MUCH  POWER THEY ALL YIELD, BOTH EN  MASSE AND THEN AS INDIVIDUAL FIRMS, AND NOW YOU HAVE  REGULATORS STEPPING IN AND SAYING, OKAY THIS IS MONOPOLY POWER I DON'T THINK THERE'S A QUESTION ABOUT THAT IN TERMS HOW MUCH THEY HAVE RIGHT NOW. SO THEY'RE GOING TO, YOU KNOW, BE HITTING UP AGAINST THESE  BARRIERS PRIVS  PRIVACY CONCERNS COMING TO THE FORE AND THIS ANTITRUST AK LOOK AT THE ANTITRUST ACTION AND SAY IT'S POLITICAL JOCKEYING,  BUT THE FACT IS, THERE'S A LOT OF PRESSURE TO ADDRESS OVER  CONCENTRATION OF POWER IN THE  TECH SECTOR BECAUSE IT'S HAVING  REAL WORLD CONSEQUENCES ON INFORMATION FLOWS, PRIVACY, ON OUR DEMOCRACY. FRANKLY, PRETTY OVERDUE. LOOK AT ANTITRUST ACTION IN THIS COUNTRY, THERE IS A LONG HISTORY OF PROTECTING FREE MARKET  COMPETITION AND INNOVATION OVER  THE LAST CENTURY BUT WE'VE BEEN IN THIS PERIOD OF NOT A LOT OF ANTITRUST ACTION, BECAUSE OF THE RISE OF THE CHICAGO SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS IN THE '70s AND THIS IDEA ALMOST  DOGMA, THAT MARKETS WOULD SIMPLY SELF-CORRECT WELL, THEY DON'T.  >> NATASHA, MAYBE IN A WAY THEY  ARE, THOUGH IS WHAT I'M PURSUING HERE I'M KIND OF WANTING TO PUSH YOU  ON THIS. >> YEAH. >> I NOTICED ALL OF THESE BIG  COMPANIES, IN THIS CASE TALKING  ABOUT APPLE MAKING A PRIVACY MOVE THAT'S HAVING A REAL IMPACT ON FACEBOOK AND ITS ECOSYSTEM. MAY THEY ARE SELF-CORRECTING IN  A WAY AND THE FOCUS SHOULDN'T BE SO MUCH ON CAN THEY DO M & A OR  DO THEY NEED TO BE BROKEN UP BUT MAYBE MAKING LAWS THAT SET RULES OF THE ROAD IN A DIGITAL ECONOMY? CONGRESS IS MORE COMFORTABLE I THINK TELLING COMPANIES WHAT THEY CAN'T DO THAN MAKING SMART  LAWS, IT SEEMS >> YEAH. I THINK THAT'S RIGHT YOU KNOW, EVEN THOUGH IT FEELS LIKE WE'VE BEEN IN THIS  INFORMATION ECONOMY FOR DECADES, THIS IS NEW TERRITORY. SO WHAT ARE THE RULES OF THE ROAD HOW CAN YOU PREVENT THIS KIND OF OVERCONCENTRATION OF POWER AND BECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN SO  MUCH POLITICAL CONCERN, YOU'RE SEEING THE COMPANIES STARTING TO SAY, OKAY. WE NEED TO ADDRESS PRIVACY WE NEED TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES, BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO BE  REGULATED. AS INVESTORS, YOU KNOW WHAT WE ALWAYS WANT IS SELF-REGULATION RIGHT? THEY THEY DON'T GET INTO PROBLEMS TO BEGIN WITH BUT IF YOU'VE GOT ZUCKERBERG SAYING BETTER TO BUY THAN  COMPETE, YOU'RE GOING TO END UP  WITH A CONSOLIDATION OF POWER. I DO THINK WHAT YOU'RE SEEING  RIGHT NOW IS, THEY'RE TRYING,  TRYING TO BE MORE RESPONSIBLE, AND TAKE ACTIONS T [Applause] good morning dinosaurs [Music] [Music] yes we're setting up water slides oh

would look like a geek. >> Nerdy, plaid. >> Unshaven, glasses. >> Spikey hair, beard. >> A guy behind a
door, that's got enough of a crack they can
slide a pizza underneath. >> I think you won't even
know who a developer is. I think you'd be surprised. >> I really don't know what
a developer looks like, but the apps they make
let us do amazing things. >> [Background Music] You
can talk about a project, you can articulate
it rationally, but you cannot communicate
architectural ideas without a drawing. I use an App called
Paper by FiftyThree. It really provides
a sense of freedom, a sense of being
emancipated from technology. It allows you to
communicate as if directly from your heart, from your soul. It's just part of you. And I think that that magic
is part of the app world. >> The app I cannot live without
is a banking app named the Zhi Fu Bao. >> Airbnb saved my life. >> I talk to my friends. >> Instagram, Tumblr. >> Like blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah. >> Evernote. >> That's the one. >> I'm addicted to Pinterest
because it is amazing. >> There's so much
entertainment. >> Duck face. >> It's limitless
what you can do. >> [Background Music]
The ocean, for me, is the lungs of our planet. The health of the ocean
is absolutely essential to the health of
us as human beings. >> Pangaea runs a
sailing expedition vessel to help scientists collect data on marine debris all
around the world. There's a variety of apps that I
use everyday, iNavX is essential for us to be able to
navigate the vessel. Marine Debris Tracker allows
you to enter the marine debris that you find into a global
database, so we can start to build up a bigger picture of
this problem around the world. I think these apps are
essential for us to be able to bring change to what's
going on in the ocean. >> The best app of all
time has to be Tinder. >> I'm most probably
like the millions of people that's got
sucked into Candy Crush. >> Robot Unicorn Attack 2. >> Crazy girl looking to
meet new people in London. Interesting. >> Words With Friends, Scrabble. >> I play Solitaire and
of course I always win. >> [Background Music]
We are stewards of dreams and hope for hitters. They come in and they want to achieve amazing
things and that's my job. Dartfish has just made
my life so much easier. I'm able to break down the swing
into parts, so that you can see, OK, here's the mistake and here's the adjustment
that I need to make. So, what you have is a kid
that can not only do it right, but then you can train him on
doing it over and over and over. Now they're able
to look and say, "You know what, I'm
getting better." And that's one of the things
that you need for life in general, but in
sports you want hope. And so now it's easy for
them to focus on dreaming. [ Noise ] >> We need like a
silence finder app. >> Pop, pop, pop, pop. Pop, pop, pop. >> I gravitate towards very
melancholy and painful songs. >> [Singing] Ahhh. >> And then it's time
to turn the page, whoop. >> This has become as
essential as my guitar. >> There are apps that
help people, that like, really improve people's lives. >> [Background Music] Every
now and then I'll sort of stare at the hand, with the sense of
sort of wonder going, "Wow." It is like magic, it really is. In combination with the
hand the app has allowed me to gain functionality
and independence. I enjoy being known as the
kid with the bionic arm. You know, it's something
interesting, and it's something different, and I'm a big fan
of being different. [ Music ] >> You open up an app and
you open up a possibility and a whole world is being born. What we really have
is an intersection between technology and art. You see the world in a different
way and I think an app can do that because it really does
open something you didn't know beforehand. >> Developers are doing
extraordinary things. >> I can't believe what they're
creating today, it's genius. >> If I met the person
that made Sky Go, I'd probably give
him a massive hug. >> You inspire me so much. >> They make our lives better
and they think of things that, obviously, regular
people can't think of. >> I don't know how
the technology works, it's just magic to me. >> There's no question they
are changing the world. >> So, to everyone
who's made any apps that I've ever enjoyed
I say, "Thank you." [ Applause ] >> Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Welcome to San Francisco. We're here today and all week to celebrate the
developer community and all of the amazing apps
that they've created. I hope that video
did a great job of capturing just
how deeply we feel about out developer community
and more importantly the number of lives they've enriched. So from all of Apple,
thank you very much. [ Applause ] This is a milestone year
for this conference. It's the 25th anniversary
of the conference. It started in 1990 with just
1,300 developers, who gathered to talk about the System 7. And there was one lab in
that developer conference. Now, WWDC is a huge conference
for Apple and a huge conference for all of our developers. We have over a thousand
of our best and brightest engineers here
today to talk with you directly in labs, about how
to improve your code. We've got people from more
countries than ever before, and two-thirds of the
attendees today are here at a developer's conference
for the very first time. [ Applause ] A special shout-out this morning to the student scholarship
winners. They worked really
hard to get here. [ Applause ] Our youngest developer in
the audience today is 13. [ Applause ] We're going to be seeing apps
from them for a long time. The developer community
is incredibly vibrant. We now have 9 million
registered developers. That's up almost 50
percent since last year. That's the most developers we've
ever added in a single year. Now, this morning,
we're gathered to talk about two powerful
platforms, OS X and iOS. And you are going to see some
great new features for both, and some great updates. But even more importantly,
you're going to see how they've
been engineered to work seamlessly together. Now, you're also going
to see the mother of all releases for developers. It's a huge release
and it's so huge that we've dedicated
an entire section of the presentation
just for this. [ Applause ] So, let's get started
with OS X and the Mac. We're shipping the best
Macs in our history. If you look just in
this last fiscal year, while the industry declined by 5
percent Macs grew by 12 percent, that's swelled our installed
base of Macs to over 80 million, which is a record for us. We're really proud of this. And of course our latest release of OS X Mavericks has
done really great. It had great features for power
users like power tabs, and tags, and enhanced support
for multiple displays. Advanced technologies
for longer battery life and greater performance. And of course, new
and improved apps. Just since its release in
October we've installed over 40 million copies
of Mavericks. This is the most of a single
release ever in Apple's history. Also, that makes over 50 percent
of our installed base working on our latest operating system. This is the fastest
adoption ever of any PC operating
system in history. Now, you may wonder how
that compares to Windows. [ Laughter ] I knew somebody was going to ask
so I decided to make a chart. [ Laughter ] Well, as it turns
out Windows 8 shipped about a year before Mavericks
and it's at 14 percent. [ Laughter ] Need I say more? [ Applause ] So, we could not be happier
with Mavericks and the momentum of the Mac, but of course
we're always future focused. And today, to talk about
the future of OS X, I'd like to invite my
colleague up, Craig Federighi, to tell us all about it. Craig. [ Applause ] >> Good morning. Wow. [ Applause ] Well, it's wonderful to be here
presenting among the greatest developers collected
in the world. You guys are fantastic. You know, it was just a
year ago, here at WWDC, when we narrowly averted a
major OS X naming crisis. [ Laughter ] You may remember that we're able
to deftly shift from names based on big cats to names based on
beautiful places in California, starting of course
with OS X Mavericks. Well, it's another year
and time for another name and so we collected our
crack product marketing team, shoved them in their VW Minibus
and set them out on the road. Now, they first ventured south
discovering OS X, Oxnard. [ Laughter ] This wasn't quite right. But undeterred, they
headed east, landed in OS X Rancho Cucamonga. [ Laughter ] Still, we hadn't
quite hit the mark. So, they boldly ventured
north landing at OS X Weed. [ Laughter ] Now-- [ Applause ] Strangely, this one had
large pockets of support within the product
marketing organization, but saner heads did
prevail and they set off on what then was somewhat
more circuitous path. It took them ultimately
to a place that embodies the
beauty and power of OS X. We discovered OS X Yosemite. [ Applause ] Now, Yosemite is a fantastic new
release with a new interface, big enhancements to
our most popular apps and something all knew,
we call Continuity. Now, I want to start
with design. OS X, of course started with
the bold design of Aqua. And over the years, it's evolved to the refined look we all
loved today in Mavericks. Well, with Yosemite, we
continue this evolution and I'd like to give you a look
at where we're headed. [ Music ] How about that? [ Applause ] I think the team has done
some remarkable work. You know, we started with the
most fundamental controls, focused always on clarity,
as well as utility. We refined the tool bars
and the window materials and the window constructions. If you look at the window title
bar, you'll see how the use of translucent materials
gives you a sense of place as you scroll your content. Now, these same carefully
crafted translucent materials are used in the sidebars. So now, your windows take on
the personality of your desktop. As you change your desktop
picture, your window adapts to reflect that personality
and that temperature. And the translucency also
helps maintain a sense of depth and place as you move your
windows over one another. Now, we also use the same
gorgeous translucent material for the dock and check out these
beautifully crafted new icons. So clean and yet so
fundamentally still Mac. And check out the trash can,
that is a gorgeous trash can. You wouldn't believe how
much time we spent crafting a trash can. [ Laughter ] So, we also focused on precise and consistent typography
throughout. So, from the menus
to the window chrome to application control is
consistent and clear type. Now, we know, for our pro users,
often, they really want to focus on the center on the
screen and not be distracted by bright menus and
bright docks, so we also introduced
a dark mode. [ Applause ] Lovers of dark. Yes. So, of course
these changes extend through to the applications. You notice here, with
Calendar, this construction with a common toolbar
and title bar area that makes the window both
more distinctly recognizable, but more importantly maximizes
the space available for content. And we carry this over throughout the
system to apps like Maps. Now, we also have a new look
for sidebar apps, like Messages, you can see it here with the
beautiful translucent material running top to bottom. And we extend that look
to apps like FaceTime, Contacts, and Reminders. All in all they come
together for a gorgeous and more usable version
of OS X, the best ever. [ Applause ] Next, let's talk about
Notification Center. Notification Center
on OS X, of course, adopts the dark translucent
material and precise type of Yosemite. It also now, most importantly,
has a new Today view. So, you get an at-a-glance
look at your Calendar, your Reminders, Weather, and
more, but most importantly, you can extend the contents of
Today view with the contents of widgets and apps that you've
downloaded from the App Store. Just add them right in and set
up the Today view, that you want for at-a-glance access
to information. And that is Notification Center. [ Applause ] Next up. Spotlight. So Spotlight has always
been a superfast way to launch applications and
find content local on your Mac. And Yosemite is a
great new interface. So when you click on
the magnifying glass on the toolbar you'll
get a big field right in the middle of the display. And if you just type
a few characters, you can launch an app just
like that, or type the name of a document and you
get great search results and an inline preview,
it's really awesome. Now, in addition to these
sources, local to your Mac, we also tap into sources of
information on the internet. So for instance, type a few
characters in like Yosemite, you can get news feed,
information from Wikipedia, and even maps all
at your finger tips. I'd like to give
you a quick demo of the new UI in Yosemite now. [ Applause ] All right. So here is our first
look at Yosemite live. So we see our beautiful new
typography in our menus, this gorgeous new dock
and these beautiful icons. Let's launch an app. I'm going to start here with
Maps and I want you to observe that as I scroll the
content of the map, the way that the title bar
actually reacts its translucency and color to the content
beneath is just really gorgeous. I'm going to launch
now another app. Calendar. So Calendar has
a new look for a week view but also an all new day view. And you notice here on day
view, I have all of my meetings in the day right
here on the left, and on the right I got
details about my appointments. So for instance,
here at 2 o'clock, we have our executive
karaoke outing, that's going to be big blast. It's right there. You want to probably drop in
on that if you get the chance. So let's take a look
now at Messages. So Messages, you see this use of the translucent sidebar
material, how it reacts subtly to the background is really
nice, and how the contents of the title bar react as I
scroll content underneath. It's really cool. Let's take a look at
Notification Center. So of course, I have
my notifications here, but I also have Today view
so I can see my Calendar at a glance, my Weather. These are interactive so I
can click, get hourly weather, clock, interact with stocks for
instance, or even Reminders. So here I'm supposed to practice
for the demo and I forgot to do that but it's too late now. So, we'll send out
one on its way. Now, of course, I can edit
these widgets as well, just click the Edit
button down here and you see widgets available
to me right here on the side. These are all from apps
that can export widgets. So I'm just going to
drag out Calculator, add that in here just like that
or even a third party widget. Let's drag one of those
in, ESPN SportsCenter. So right there, I get all my
information right at a glance. It's really awesome. [ Applause ] So next. Spotlight. So I'm going to click here on
the magnifying glass and, boom, got a search field right in
the middle of the screen. I can type just a couple of
characters to launch an app like our new reminders. There it is. It's that easy. But of course, Spotlight is
great for looking up people too. So I'm going to look
up Phil Schiller here. There's Phil. And you see I have all of
his contact information here, but I also have matches
on mail from Phil. Phil and I are planning
a camping trip. He's a bit of a gear nut
and has something he wants to try out on our trip. We also have Events
and Reminders. So we have here that our Meeting
at the Campsite and-- oh, good. I see that Jeff and Johnny are
both in on the trip as well. And I'll tell you, you just have
not had chili by the campfire until you've eaten it with one of Johnny's custom
crafted aluminium spoons. [ Laughter ] It's a-- it's the diamond
cut chamfered edges that really make the experience. So, I'm working on a document
as well to help plan our trip. Now, there are a lot of ways
of course to find documents, but one way now is by app. So this is a numbers document. I typed numbers and you
see in addition to the app, I get all my recent documents
that I've opened with that app and I can access
them right here. So let's open up my hiking trip. And here we see that the trip
has planned involved a 16.4 mile hike and you're being an
operations professional. Jeff is a big stickler
for the metric system. And so, fortunately,
Spotlight has my back. I can just type in
16.4 miles here and I get an instant
conversion to kilometers. So that's awfully handy. We do all kinds of conversion. They drop that in, fix
that document right up. [ Applause ] All right. Well, that's enough
for my document. I can also do great searches
like just type a few characters, bang, I've got Yosemite
entry from Wikipedia. I've got news from
various sources. I even have maps right here. Well, you know, I'm looking to
plan a dinner and maybe a movie out and now without
even launching an app, I can just do a look up
for sushi for instance. And we see I have maps
results right here, right inside of Spotlight. And of course, in addition
to map information, we've got pictures,
great information from Yelp, it's all right there. And to wrap it up, I want
to go out to a movie. You can just type
in Godzilla here. Oh, there we go, Godzilla. And you see, I have show times where it's playing near me
right here in Spotlight as well as content I can stream from the
iTunes Store, all in Spotlight. That's a quick look at
the new UI of Yosemite. [ Applause ] So next, iCloud Drive. Now-- OK, intriguing. So, we all know that
documents in the Cloud, provides a really convenient
way for working with an app that works across all platforms
working on the same document. But now with iCloud Drive, your Mac in addition will
let you work on those within the document has, all of those folders right
accessible inside of Finder. And in addition to those
apps that are local to your Mac you can
get a content from apps that you don't have on your Mac, so get a contents
from iOS documents. But even better, you can
store all of your own files of any sort and organize them
however you wish with folders and tags and they're
synchronized automatically across all your Macs. [ Applause ] And all of this content
is also accessible from your iOS devices via the
iCloud document picker right in app. And what the heck we're
throwing in Windows, too. [ Laughter & Applause ] Next up. Mail. So, Mail in Yosemite has an
elegant new Yosemite style UI. But we really focused
on the basics, reliable synching fast switching
between mailboxes, quick fetches of your new mail, the basics. But in addition to that, we want
to address a fundamental problem with email, which is these
days we so often want to send large attachments
whether it's videos or large sets of photos and
we're underpinning one of these, a message saying that our
recipient's mail server can't take those large attachments. Well, we're solving that problem with the technology
we call Mail Drop. With Mail Drop, instead of
your message bouncing off your recipient's mail
server, you can elect to have the attachment
sent encrypted and securely via iCloud
separate from the message and it rendezvous on
the receiving end. So, if your recipient has a Mac,
they get it just like before. And if they have another
client, they get a link to securely download
those attachments. And those attachments can
be up to 5 gigs in size. That's Mail Drop [ Applause ] So next. Markup. Have you ever been working on an
email message and you realized that if you could just
maybe circle something or write something
on the message, maybe do a little something,
you can get your point across so much more clearly,
well, now with Markup you can. It burns right back in
to your mail message, and it even works with PDFs. So if you needed, for instance,
sign a PDF, you can now do that with your iSight camera or even drawing your
signature right on the trackpad and it goes right
into the email message and you can send on its way. It's going to be super handy. Next. Great. I love it. Next up. Safari. We've in Yosemite been
able to pack all the power of the Safari UI
into this single bar, and that means you have
more space for your content. Now, of course, you may
wonder what happened on my Favorites bar. Well, of course, you can bring
that back if you want to. But in Yosemite you
don't really need to because now your
Smart Search Field when you click it shows you all
of your favorites right there. And it's also really
great for search. So in addition, when
you type to get in your smart search
suggestions, you also get spotlight
suggestions right there in your completion menu. And this means, you can get
things faster than ever before. Now, Safari is also more
powerful than ever with sharing. So now, if you want to subscribe
to an RSS feed on the site, you can do that right here and those RSS feed
articles will show up right in your Safari sidebar
under Shared Links. And you can also share to
people more quickly than ever, because Safari lists the
people you've message with most recently, and with
just one click you can share a webpage. Now, Safari is better than
ever as well with tabs. We now have a tab view that
gives you a bird's-eye glance of all of your tabs and it
stacks tabs from sites just like this so you get
individual stacks for each site that
you're browsing. Safari is also great
when it comes to privacy. Safari was the first browser
to introduce private browsing and now it's easier than ever, because you can create
a new private window. And when you do, all the
content within that window and all its tabs
stay private and all of your other windows
are unaffected. It's really handy. Now, Safari is great when
it comes to standards. It has WebGL now for
superfast 3D graphics, SPDY for efficient networking,
and HTML Premium Video. Now, this enables modern Macs
to efficiently stream video from site like Netflix
without a plug-in and the results are awesome. You get up to two hours
longer battery life on a MacBook Air
streaming Netflix. And that's for 1080P video. Now, Safari has been
set the benchmark really for energy efficiency
since Mavericks and its lead here continues. When it comes to multi-tab
browser energy efficiency, Safari is without equal. And when it comes to the
kind of UI manipulations that are typical in web apps,
Safari is faster than ever. And how about JavaScript? Well, take the most complex kind
of JavaScript that's typical of very rich web applications. Well, Safari now has a Fourth
Tier LLVM-based optimized JavaScript Compiler that is the
fastest of any major browser. And when it comes to
typical website JavaScript, Safari is in a league
of its own. So of that is Safari. And to give you a quick
demo, I'd like to bring up Brian Crowe to the stage. Let's give him a big welcome. Brian. [ Applause ] >> Thanks Craig. I'm really happy
to be here today. So, I'm just going to
dive right into Safari. Here we go. It's really great. And when you go to a website, you can really appreciate
the new design. It's simpler and it's
even more powerful. I can open up the sidebar really
easily to get at my Bookmarks, my Reading List as well
as my Shared Links. And when I click into the Search
field, I get instant access to all my favorite sites. It's really nice. So, I'm going to
go ahead and type in a search for Ansel Adams. There we go. And if I hit return,
I can just go to a regular old Google search. But, since Ansel Adams
is a common search term, I get this new Spotlight
suggestion there at the top. It has a snippet of
information from Wikipedia. I can read it there, or
if I'd like I can go ahead and see the entire article
right on the Wikipedia site. It's super convenient. Now, if you use tabs,
you're going to love this. Now, no matter how many
tabs I have opened, I can smoothly scroll
through them to get at any of that tab I'm looking for. It's really nice. [ Applause ] So now, sometimes I want to
see my tabs so I can go ahead and do this and I'll click
on the new Tab View button. And there you go, a
beautiful bird's eye view of all my open tabs. So, I'm going to go ahead
and select this one here. It's a photoblog with a
bunch of pictures of Yosemite and there's a couple of good
ones of El Capitan down below. So, I'll find in
there El Capitan. And then I'm going
to choose this one. Now, I want to share it
with Craig so I'm going to get the high-res image. Now, sharing couldn't
be easier in Safari. I just simply click on
the Share button here, and now I can use the new
recent recipients feature to address it to Craig. And here we go. And with just one click, I'm
ready to send that image. It's that easy. So-- But before I send it, I'm going to add my
two cents to this. So, I can go here and we
have just the right feature called Markup. Now with Markup, I
can edit this image without ever even leaving Mail. It's really great. So, what I'm going to do
is annotate this image with a nice magnifying
glass a loop. So, you move it around
you can say that it magnifies
everything underneath it. So, I'm going to
place it right here. And it turns out
that those two specs on the big granite face there,
they're actually climbers. It's kind of crazy. So, I'm going to
zoom it a little more so you can see it better. There we go. So, I can zoom nicely
and place it here. Now, I want to point this
out to Craig in the mail. And I can use my trackpad
to draw on the image. So, I'm going to go ahead
and draw an arrow here. There we go. And you notice Markup's smart
enough to recognize the arrow and make it really pretty. So now-- now, it's really
easy to add a comment. And so, check out the climbers. There we go. Now, I can have a little
fun with this, so I'm going to go ahead and create
a cartoon bubble, OK? I'm not so good at drawing
but Markup's going to help me. There we go. So, luckily you can
clean that up [phonetic], it's better than I am. So now I can add a caption. And so, I think I'm
going to appeal to the inner developer
and all of us. I'm going to type in
"I hope the rope is," wait for it, "multithreaded." Yeah. [ Laughter ] OK. So, I think I've done
enough to this picture. Time to go. So, now it's ready
for me to mail and I can just click like that. So that's how easy it is
to Markup an image in Mail. So, those are just a couple of great new features
in Safari in Mail. Thank you. [ Applause ] >> How about that
parallel programming joke. You did not see that coming. Next, something entirely
different. It's called the Continuity. So now at Apple, we
believe you should be able to use the right
device for the moment. Maybe your phone when you're on
the go, your iPad when you want to kick back on the
couch, or maybe your Mac when you're trying to
get some work done. But we also want the transitions
between these moments to be absolutely as natural
and seamless as possible. Now, our Continuity features
start with something simple and that's AirDrop,
because now AirDrop works between iOS and the Mac. [ Applause ] It's really convenient. But now we have something
that we really take it to the next level and
that's called Handoff. So, it turns out now that when
you're working on your Mac, your devices around you
in proximity are aware of each other and aware
of what you're up to. And so, if you want to pick up
where you left off on your Mac and your iPad, your iPad
is prompting you right in the lower left of the screen. Just swipe up and you
can pick up working on what you're working on
your Mac right on your iPad. And this-- [ Applause ] This works in the other
direction as well. So, let's say, you're
composing an email on your phone and you walk up to your Mac. Well, your Mac will
notice what you're doing and prompt you right
on the dock. You click it and you
can pick up finishing that message right on your Mac. [ Applause ] Now, we've been able to take
this same proximity awareness and make the process of
creating a hotspot easier than ever before. So now, if you're using your Mac
and you're away from a network but your phone is nearby, when
you go up to your Wi-Fi menu, your Mac, actually without any
configuration ever have been done on your phone, sees
your phone and prompts you so you click it and it
automatically sets up a hotspot. You never type a
password and you're on the network that easily. [ Applause ] And this works even
if your phone is across the room sitting
in a handbag. You just never have to touch it. Now, the next that we really
wanted to handle is SMS. Now, we all love iMessage. We can continue our
conversations seamlessly from device to device but
then we have these green bubble friends. And, you know, they have
inferior devices and they insist on sending us messages,
and we don't want to hold it against them. But the problem is that
those messages don't show up on our other devices
until now, because now-- [ Applause ] -- your phone is able to access
or relay to automatically and transparently send your
messages between devices. Now, believe it or not, we're able to do the same
thing with phone calls. So now, when you
receive a phone call, your Mac gives you caller ID
and you can even accept the call and use your Mac
as a speaker phone. [ Applause ] And believe it or not, this
works even if your phone is across the house in a charger. You never have to miss a call. Well, now that your
Mac is all phone savvy, it's also a great way
to dial the phone. So, if you're in Contacts and
you want to dial a number, you can do it right there. And even on a webpage, you
see a number you want to call, you can call it right
from your Mac. So I want to give you-- [ Applause ] So if you're up for it, I'd
love to give you a demo now. All right. So, let's check out Continuity. And we're going to
start with Handoff. I'm going to pick
up my iPhone here. And I was composing an email
about our karaoke night. Does anyone want to--
you know, I'm by my Mac, so let's use my Mac here. And you notice my
Mac actually is aware that I was using my phone. So with a click, I
bring up that message to right where I left of. Does anyone want to
go-- and you know, to give these people
some inspiration about what they might be able
to experience at karaoke night, you just summon a picture from
last year's karaoke event. [ Laughter ] Now, that ought to
get them going. So, I'll send that
one on its way. Now, of course, this works
in the other direction. Oh, it looks like Andrea
is up for some karaoke. And he sent me a URL just to a
good place to go for karaoke. So, I can pull that up here. Now, if I want to show
this page to a friend, maybe pick up my iPad, you
notice as I look at my iPad. Let's put that up on the screen. There at the bottom is Safari. I just flick up and it takes
me right to where I left off. It's really amazing. [ Applause ] >> Next up, phone calling. Hold it one sec. Well, this is from my mom. Now, she is surely
wants to grill me about newest Fourth Tier
LLVM Compiler in Safari but this is not the right time. I know you'd all love to
hear from mom but I'm going to scrape-- I'm sorry. [ Laughter ] I'm sorry. She's a wonderful,
wonderful woman. But that's-- this is my space. [ Laughter ] So, but, you know, I would like to show you how we
can make phone calls. And so, I can dial
from web pages. So, for instance, if I wanted
to go dial a phone number like this one right
here, I could just select and hit it just like this. And you notice I get an option to call right here
inside of Safari. But, you know, I wanted
to make a phone call to a new Apple employee
that's joined in. So, it's something we
do from time to time. So, let me just bring up this. Here we go. A little welcome call? Let's give him a WWDC welcome. So, let's have my Mac
dial via my iPhone. I talk to people like him
all the time of course. This is very normal for me. [ Phone Ringing ] >> Hello? >> Wow. Hey, it's
Craig Federighi here. >> Hey, how are you doing? This is Dre. >> Hey, Doctor, you're on
speaker phone with via my Mac with over 6,000 amazing
developers here at WWDC. We all want to welcome
you to Apple. >> Hey, thanks Craig. I love a big audience. I want to thank everybody there for creating such
an amazing apps. >> Yeah, they have
created some amazing apps. >> By the way, I'm
glad you called. I hear Tim gets in pretty early. What time should I
show up for work? [ Laughter ] >> If you want to beat Tim into
the office, it'd be about 4:30. But, I think, you
know, orientation-- new employee orientation
starts at 9:00. So and you don't want to
miss the free t-shirts so I'd shoot for 9:00. >> Sounds good. I can't wait to get to work
with the team at Apple. >> Well, Dre, it's been
great chatting with you. I'll see you around campus. >> Thanks, Craig. Talk soon. >> All right, bye. [ Applause ] >> And, that's continuity, so
Yosemite, a beautiful new design with notification center
with the new Today view and customizable widgets,
spotlight with fast search and access to all kinds of
great sources of information on the internet, a
new iCloud Drive, mail with great new features. Safari, faster and
more elegant than ever. And of course, continuity. It's a wonderful new
release, Yosemite. And it's available to you
developers here today. [ Applause ] Now, everyone else will get
it in the fall and believe it or not, it will be free. [ Applause ] Now, we're doing something
a little unusual this summer as well which is we're
having a public beta program. So, if you're a non-developer
and you want to help us improve Yosemite,
you can sign up on the web and you can receive access to Yosemite betas
throughout the summer. That is OS X Yosemite. I think you're going to love it. I'm going to hand
it back to Tim. Thank you. [ Applause ] >> Thank, Craig. [ Applause ] It's a really terrific release. I'm just glad I'm
in the beta program. [ Laughter ] Next up is iOS. [ Applause ] We've now sold well over 800
million iOS devices and each of the categories of devices has
set its own significant sales record in the past year. iPod Touch has passed
100 million units. iPad has passed 200
million units. And iPhone has passed
half a billion units. This is incredible. But what's even more impressive
is how many new customers to Apple that iOS
devices has brought to us. Over 130 million customers
who bought an iOS device in the past 12 months was
buying their first Apple device. [ Applause ] Now, many of these customers
were switchers from Android. They had bought an
Android phone by mistake. [ Laughter ] And then had sought a better
experience and a better life. [ Laughter ] And decided to check
out iPhone and iOS. Nearly, in fact, nearly half
of our customers in China in the past six months
switched from Android to iPhone. This is incredible and of course that better experience
is our devices in iOS. And iOS 7 took that
experience to even higher level. The customer sat with iOS
7 is really off the charts. Change wave recently
measured it at 97 percent. These are customer sat
ratings that no one gets. It's really enormous. Now, one of the reasons why
customers say they love iOS is that we make available
our software updates for the OS available to as
many customers as possible. And, if you look at what
has happened with iOS 7, our latest release,
almost 9 out of 10 people in our install base are running
our latest operating system. [ Applause ] Now, this is in stark
contrast to Android. [ Laughter ] If you look at their latest
release, less than one out of 10 of their customers are
on their latest software. And, if you look at a
broader group, over a third of their customers
are running a version of Android from four years ago. That's like ancient history. [ Laughter ] Now, that means that these
customers are not getting great new features. They're not able to
run your latest apps. And, they don't get
security updates that they may need to stay safe. And, this is particularly
important for Android which dominates the
mobile malware market. [ Laughter ] No wonder experts are
saying things like this. Android fragmentation
is turning devices into a toxic hell stew
of vulnerabilities. Now, fortunately, iOS hasn't
had this kind of issues because we do everything we can
to make our updates available to as many people as possible. So, we could not be
happier with iOS 7 and the momentum of iOS devices. But, we are not standing still. Today, we're announcing iOS 8. [ Applause ] And, iOS 8 is a giant release and it's really two
stories not one. It has great end user features. But, it also has
incredible developer features so you can extend your
experience and build apps that you couldn't do before. We'd like to get started with
describing it with talking about the end user features. And, to do that, I'd
like to bring Craig back up to the stage. Craig? [ Applause ] >> I missed you guys. So, what? Let's talk
about iOS 8. Now, iOS 8 of course builds
on the design of iOS 7 with enhancements for
both iPhone and iPad. And, let's start with the phone. Now, in iOS 8, we've
refined notification center. But, what I really love are our
new interactive notifications. So now, if you get a message
like this, just pull down and you can reply from
right where you are. [ Applause ] You don't have to leave
the app you're in. And this works for all
kinds of notifications. If you get a calendar event
for instance, just pull down and respond and it works
on the lock screen. So, you can just swipe
across in the lock screen. You get those action
buttons tapped and you've dealt
with it right there. Now, in iOS 7, we gave you
quick double-tap access to get at your most recent apps. Well now, you can also use
that same double tap to get at the people you communicate
with most frequently. It's really handy. And, in iOS 7, we introduce
this great Tab View in Safari. Well, we're bringing a great
Tab View to iPad as well with this bird's eye
view of all of your tabs. And, Safari also picks up
the Side Bar that we love in Yosemite with access to your
bookmarks, your reading list and your shared links. Now, we've made managing your
mail easier than ever before. So now, if you're reading a
message, you want to remember to get back to it so you're
going to mark it on red. We can do that with
just a single gesture. And, if you want
to flag a message, you can just pull across,
there's a flag option. But, if you pull
all the way across, you can delete with
just a gesture. But the piece I love the
best is what we've done with composing messages. Have you ever found
yourself composing an email and then you really wish like
you get at something else in your inbox maybe
for that reply? Well now, you can. Just swipe that message
down and you have access to the rest of your mail. [ Applause ] So, I'd like to give
you a demo of some of these great iOS
8 enhancements now. So, here we are on
our iOS 8 lock screen. And, if I receive
a notification, it looks like I happen to
get one just right then, I can swipe across and you see
I have action so I can accept or decline this meeting
right here. And, of course, I'm
going to use the device, if I'm in here maybe playing
some music here on iTunes radio, I might get a notification. And, if I do get notification, I
can just swipe down on it, too. So, here's one, just swipe down. Now, I get access
to my keyboard. I can type right there. Now, this works great for
third party apps as well. So, for instance, looks like
I got tagged on Facebook, I can like it right here with
an actionable notification. And, sometimes, you
receive notifications that you just really don't
want deal with right now and you can just flick
those away like that. That's really handy. Now, we've made getting at
people easier than ever before. So, if I just double-tap
my Home button, so I have all the people I most
recently communicated with. I swipe to the side and I have
access to all my favorites. If I tap on one, I have controls
here to give them a phone call, iMessage them or even
FaceTime right here with just a double-tap
on the Home button. It's really handy. Now, I want to show you some of the enhancements
we made to mail. Let's go take a look an
iPad actually this time. So, here we are on iPad. I'm going to launch mail. Now, I have a number
of unread messages here so let's work our
way through them. Here's a message from Open
Table with a dinner appointment. And, you notice that the
reservation is actually called out right here on the top. Mail has actually given me an
intelligent suggestion here to add it to my calendar. I can tap Add and just
like this, it lets-- it prompts me to fill out and
add an event to my calendar. That's really handy. Now, sometimes, you
get a message like this where you're going to have
to do some thinking about it. Maybe get back to it later. Well now, with just a single
swipe, I can mark it as unread. It's really cool. You can also flag really easily. So, this is a message
I want to flag. Just flick it across and flag. Now, here's a nice message. I don't know who this fellow is
but he says great collaboration. You and Johnny have really
come together really well. Let's take a look at that one. Oh, dear God. [ Laughter ] Well, this would be a good time to demonstrate our
quick delete feature. So, I can drag all the way
across and delete at a glance. I'm certain that
message won't haunt me on the internet for
years to come. So, let's talk about composing. I got a message here from a
friend who's visiting in town, who's looking for
a good restaurant. So, I'll start replying
to this message. And, I'll say, let's see--
check out and then, you know, actually I got a
good recommendation from another friend
here in my inbox, so I'd like to get to that now. Well, I can just swipe
this draft down like this. Go right into another
place, another message in my inbox, tap
out a selection. That looks like exactly
what I want to send him so I'll just copy that. And now, with a tap
at the bottom, I restore my draft
just like that. I can paste and send
it on its way. I think we're all going to
love doing mail this way. That's a quick look, few
enhancements to iOS 8. [ Applause ] So, let's talk about Spotlight. And of course, Spotlight
is a super convenient way to search in your device. You just pull down one
on your home screen and you can execute
these searches, find things like launching
apps or find an email message. But now, with those same things
we showed you in Yosemite, with Spotlight Suggestions,
you can get it so much more. You can search for apps and find
matches of apps that you don't yet have on the App Store. You can search for
points of interest and get Wikipedia
entries and directions. You can search for news,
search for restaurants, songs, not just in your own
library but also on iTunes. And, when you search for a
movie, you can get results both for theaters nearby as well as
content available for streaming. And, when you search
inside of Safari in addition to your great Google
Search suggestions, you can also get a
suggestion at a glance for the answer you're
looking for right from Spotlight Suggestions. So, that is the new Spotlight. Next, the keyboard and the
technology we call QuickType. Oh. [ Laughter ] So, prior to iPhone, this
was the state-of-the-art in smartphone typing. But, iPhone changed all of that
with the introduction of Touch. And, we've been able to do
so much more like access to special characters or
alternate character sets, special keyboard layouts, even
handwriting and dictation. But, underlying it all have
been the language models under autocorrect. Well now, in iOS 8,
QuickType supports predictive typing suggestions. So, as you type,
you get suggestions for the next words you
might want to type, and you can tap things out
faster than ever before and it's incredibly smart. So, it's context sensitive. For instance in messages,
if someone asks you, do you want to go for
dinner or a movie? It's going to suggest
dinner or a movie. [ Applause ] And, it's personalized. It learns how you type to different people
in different apps. So, maybe you're communicating
with a co-worker and it's going to say, well, the meeting was
canceled, rescheduled, moved. These are kind of formal terms. But now, if you're
communicating with someone else, we have a different
communication style, you might get the meeting was
epic, awesome or a snoozer because it learns how you type. And, when it does, it does so in a way that's always
protecting your privacy. All that learning is done
local to the device and none of your keystrokes
leave the device. Now, QuickType has
great language models for all of these languages. [ Applause ] So, I think we're all going to
be typing a whole lot faster. Next of course, continuity. You get all the great
continuity features. So now, on your iPads,
you can pick up where you left
off on your iPhone. You can set up an
instant hotspot with no configuration
on your iPad. You can receive your
messages on your iPad and when you receive a call
from someone going like this, you can pick it up
right on your iPad. It's really great and
that's continuity. Next up, Messages. So, Messages is the most
frequently used app on iOS. And, in iOS 8, it's
better than ever. So, when it comes
to group messaging, we have some great enhancements. You can now name your threads. You can add or remove people
from a conversation underway. [ Applause ] And, if you've ever been on
one of those noisy threads that just keeps buzzing
in your pocket, well, you can do not disturb on a per
thread level and you can choose when to leave the tread. This is pretty important. [ Applause ] Now, you also can
share your location with people in a conversation. And, if they've shared
their location with you, you can see it from write
with inside messages. And you also have really
great at a glance view of all of the pictures and attachments
that are shared on any thread. But one feature that I really
love is our new Tap to Talk. You just hold your finger
down on the microphone button and then you can just
swipe up with your finger when you're done talking
and send what you said. And it's really great for
video messaging as well. So to give you a quick demo
of the all new messages, I'd like to bring up Greg
Joswiak to the stage. Jos? [ Applause & Cheering ] >> Thank you Craig. It's fun to be up here
to be the first one to show you what a rich
and powerful platform for communication
messages has become. So let's get right into it. So I got a message here
waiting from my friend and co-worker, Kim Vorrath. So I could just slide
that of course as usual. It goes right into my messages. And what I see here
is I have a thread between me, Kim, and Craig. But what I have that's new in the upper right hand
corner is this Details button. So if I tap it, it gives
me all kinds of information about participants
in the message. For one, Craig and Kim decided
to share their location with me. So Craig of course
is up here with us in San Francisco while Kim is
working hard back in Cupertino. Thanks Kim for that. One of the things I
can do is add contacts. I can add people to this
conversation as we go, but I can also choose
to share my location. So if I just tap and Share
My Location, I can choose to share my location for an
hour for the rest of the day or I can keep sharing it until
I stop somewhere in the future. But what's really convenient
is this Do Not Disturb button. How many times you've
been in one of those super chatty
group conversations that your phone is
just continuing to buzz over and over? Well now, I can just
choose to Do Not Disturb that particular thread and
not get my phone buzzing. So, I'm going to find
that useful with Kim and Craig, I know that for sure. Or I can even Leave
this Conversation with just a single tap. What's also convenient
is the fact that I have all the
attachments, all the photos from this conversation
all in one place. So they still appear in line
in the thread but now instead of trying to find that picture
by scrolling, scrolling, scrolling, they all come in
one place here in the thread, so very, very convenient. So let's go back to
that conversation, Kim had asked me how it's going. Well, I have lots of
ways to reply to her. I could tap out which just
a few taps and, you know, use my predictive
keyboard, a message. But it's even cooler that I can
now do an audio or video message to her with just a swipe. So I'll send back an
audio message to her. Hey Kim, I'm just hanging
out here with about 6,000 of our closest friends. Having a good time while
Craig takes a much deserved break backstage. Slide up, sends the
message just like that. Super easy. And I can do the same
thing with a video message or even with a selfie. So I'm going to dare
a selfie here. It's all down the camera button. [ Laughter & Applause ] Not my best look. Let's see what Kim
has to say about that. So, I can-- see, I got an
audio message from Kim, all I have to do is tap the play
button and hear the message. >> Impressive Jos. You've totally mastered
the duck face selfie. >> Well, I'm glad she likes it. So it's super duper easy
to do this sort of things. You notice that it said it
would expire in a couple of minutes 'cause you don't
want to have this clean this up. Audio and video messages
can take up space so it self-destruct
unless you choose to keep-- whoa, what's this? So Craig should be backstage but he apparently has sent me a
message and it looks important. So if you don't mind I'm
going to play it back. And I can play it back in line
even with a video message here. >> Jos, we got a serious
situation developing back here. >> I can't control this. These are not going to work. >> Bryan, you got
to do something. >> I got it. >> Jos, I'm going to need
you to buy some more time. [ Laughter & Applause ] >> Needless to say, hair
like that doesn't come easy. So while he's dealing with
his crisis backstage-- oh look, I've actually got
an audio message from him. Now, what's really cool
is I can actually listen to audio messages and reply to
them from the lock screen simply by raising the iPhone to my ear. >> Hey Jos, we got the
crisis contained back here. I'm good to go, so wrap it
up whenever you're ready. >> And that's easy to
listen to a message. I can reply to it the same way. Craig, it's good to hear that you survived the
great hair crisis of 2014. I'll get things wrapped up here and we'll get the
show back to you. Lower it and the
message is sent. Super easy. So-- [ Applause ] So that's the all new Messages
app, super easy, super powerful. Send a message through
just a swipe or even just by raising it to your ear. So thank you everybody. [ Applause ] >> OK. So next up, iCloud Drive. So, of course, iCloud
documents work great across a single app
on your iOS devices. But now, with iCloud Drive,
you also have a great way to work across applications. So say you're in an app here
like Sketchbook, you can bring up your iCloud Drive panel
and open documents directly from other applications like a compatible document
inside of GoodReader. And when you open it up in that
document, in that application and edit it, those edits
are saved right back to their original locations. So you don't end up with all of these different
versions and copy problems. Now, of course, you also have
access to all of those documents on your Mac and on
Windows as well. So that's iCloud Drive. Next up, something you weren't
expecting from me, Enterprise. Now it turns out that iOS-- yeah, they got one Enterprise
guy over there, I know. So iOS is a huge hit
in the Enterprise. In fact, 98 percent of
the Fortune 500 uses iOS. And we're going to
get the last two. And it's in part
because of these great iOS-tailored applications. But it's also because of the
amazing array of technologies, both technologies that
applied to all of us in protecting our
privacy and security but also Enterprise
manageability features that we've added to
iOS over the years. Now, one of them
that we just released in the last few months I think
is emblematic of our philosophy of the Enterprise, and that's
the Device Enrollment Program. Now traditionally, if you
go to work at a company and they want you to give you
a device, they actually have to take the device they give
you, rip it out of its box, connect it to some PC,
image it with software to configure, it's a big pain. But now with the Device
Enrollment Program, you can actually get
your iPad or iPhone in its original shrink wrap box. And when you open it up, it'll
automatically configure itself for your Enterprise,
setting up all of your mail and getting your mail
messages, automatically setting up your calendar, and even
downloading all your Enterprise apps, it's that simple. Well now, in iOS 8, we
continue our focus on security, productivity and management. iOS 8 has expanded
data protection. So you get passcode protection of all the major data types
including third-party apps. We have a Per-message S/MIME and we have a great productivity
feature I think we're all going to like called VIP threads. So now, there's a thread
you're on or message you send, and you want to get notified on the lock screen whenever
there's a reply on that thread, you can get that
with just a tap. Now we also have Automatic Reply
for Exchange, for Out of Office, Free/Busy information
in calendar. And we support third-party
Enterprise document providers in addition to iCloud,
integrated right in to iCloud capable
applications. Now we also improved
our management-- yes, the Enterprise
guy back there. [ Applause ] So, we also extend
our management to include managed
books and PDFs, and this is of course especially
valuable for education. So those are just a few
features for Enterprise. Now, something that we all
care a lot about, Health. Whoa. [ Applause ] So, developers have created a
vast array of healthcare devices and accompanying applications, everything from monitoring
your activity level, to your heart rate,
to your weight, and chronic medical conditions
like high blood pressure and diabetes, but up to now
the information gathered by those applications
lives in silos. You can't get a single
comprehensive picture of your health situation. But now you can with HealthKit. HealthKit provides
a single place that applications can contribute
to a composite profile of your activity and health. And HealthKit comes with a corresponding
application, Health. And with Health, you can
monitor all of your metrics that you're most
interested in your activity. But not just that, you can
use third-party applications. Now we carefully
protect your privacy so you have total control over
which applications have access to which part of your
healthcare information. But you can for instance provide
different activity, weight, heart rate information
to the Nike app. And Nike is working to
integrate HealthKit, so they use that information
to help you in your pursuit of your personalized
fitness goals. Now, we're also working
with the Mayo Clinic, innovators in healthcare. And with their integration
with HealthKit, they're going to be able that when a patient
takes let's say a blood pressure reading, HealthKit
automatically notifies their app and their app is automatically
able to check whether that reading is within
that patient's personalized healthcare parameters
and thresholds. And if not, it can contact
the hospital proactively, notify a doctor and that
doctor can reach back to that patient providing
more timely care. Now-- [ Applause ] Now we think this is going to be
really important for healthcare and the CEO of the
Mayo Clinic agrees. He says that, "We believe
Apple's HealthKit will revolutionize the
health industry-- how the health industry
interacts with people. We're proud to be
at the forefront of this innovative technology
with the Mayo Clinic app." We agree. Now we're also
working with leaders in healthcare applications
like Epic systems. Now they provide the technology
that enables hospitals serving over 100 million Americans. And so now with their
integration with HealthKit, patients-- these leading
institutions will be able to get closer in
sharing their information with their doctors
and that is Health. [ Applause ] Next up, Family Sharing. It's the easy way to
share what's important. Now when I was a kid, the refrigerator was the
center of family sharing. Our refrigerator looked just like this except the
kid who had gray hair. But we've now in iOS made it
that easy to set up your family on their iOS devices and once
you've set up your family as a family unit,
you automatically get to share photos with the shared
photo stream, to share calendars with your family, to
share reminder list and automatically
configure things like with permission,
Find My Friends. And find your kid's devices,
which is something I do about every other day. It's really handy. Now, of course, we're also used to in the home sharing
physical media. But increasingly, our media
is in the form of songs from iTunes, movies,
books, and apps. Well now, with Family Sharing, you can get it not just your
purchases but the purchase of all the members
of your family. [ Applause ] You just click right
through and download. And this is for up
to six family members who all share the
same credit card. And it works great for
kids as well and not just because they can make
purchases on your credit card, but in fact because when
they do make a purchase, they get prompted ask
you for permission. And you automatically get
messaged on your device. [ Applause ] And that's Family Sharing. Next, Photos. We all take a lot of photos
increasingly with our iPhones and we share them with
whatever device we have handy. Well now, we're bringing
together photos with iCloud so that every photo you
take are available to you on all of your devices. [ Applause ] We're not only preserving the
common organization edits you do to all of your photos for your
consistent iCloud photo library but your device actually
has access to more photos in the cloud than it can
physically store locally so you can get them
all wherever you are. Now of course, if you
have these many photos, you want great search and
so we now on iOS 8 Photos, we give you great search
suggestions for instance of locations, photos taken
near where you are right now, photos taken a year ago today,
photos taken in your home, but we also give you search. And so that search lets you
match on things like location, time, and also on albums
that you've set up. Now, we also help you
perfect your photos with great new Smart
Editing controls. So we have special smart
controls for light and color and also for things like
auto-straightening and cropping. I'd like to give you a demo
of our new Photos app now. [ Applause ] All right. Let's take a look at photos. So here I am in my large
cloud photo collection, and I have great search here,
so I have all my suggestion but I can also start typing
and you notice I get matches on location and time period. But also an album, so here
I have beach day with Mandy. And I can tap right in there, look through these nice
photos, let's take a look. Those are some good ones. Now that's a photo that
I think has potential but it's really quite dark
and kind of washed out. Unfortunately, we have these
great smart editing controls that I can use to fix it up, so
I'm going to bring up our levels and you also have levels
for light and color down there at the bottom. I'm going tap on light, and I get this great
smart light meter. Now I can just drag this across
like this and it lightens up the photo really nicely, so I dial that in
just the way I want. But what's happening under
the hood is really amazing. You notice that to achieve
the lightning effect, it brought brightness
and contrast up, exposure and highlights down
and shadows up based on detailed image analysis of
what would achieve that effect. Now I could go in and
I could manually try to tweak those parameters like
have that level of control but I don't need to because
it does such a great job and I also have that control
for color, so I can just drive up the color for instance, bring
out the sky and the skin tones and I look at the difference
of what we've been able to achieve before, after,
it's really awesome. [ Applause ] Now what's really
great is that my edit of course immediately went
up to my cloud photo library. And so they're available
to all my devices, so let's take a look at my iPad. So here's my iPad. Now I'm going to go on to my
favorites album, and we notice that right now in favorites,
I don't have that picture because I didn't favorite it. But now that I've
made those nice edits, the picture is looking great,
I think I'll make it one of my favorites, I'll just tap
on my iPhone on a little heart and you notice that it appears
automatically here on my iPad, so I can go into that
photo right here. Now we have those same editing
controls tailored for iPad, so I'm going to go in to
do a crop and do a kind of extreme close up crop
here like this, hit done and of course these changes
are going to go up live to my iPad photo library and
it go right across to my phone. [ Applause ] So of course you may be
wondering what about the Mac? Well good news, we are
working on a new grounds up photo solution for the Mac
built with iCloud in mind, and that's going to be
shipping early next year but I'd like to give you
a sneak peek now. All right. So let's take a look
at photos on the Mac. As you see, I get beautiful
buttery scrolling here. I have my moments right here,
I can pinch out if I want from moments to collections
and all the way out to years. I can scrub through my photos
like this even in year view. If I find a photo I like,
just let go and zoom right in. You watch as I magnify
this photo, the interplay with the title bar,
it's really gorgeous. I'm going to go ahead and browse
through these a little bit. Now here's a photo
that looks really like it's got some potential but it could use
some brightening up, can have the same
kinds of adjustments. You notice here at this
light and color meters, well, I can just close this control,
so we can watch what happens in real time as I make
the lighting adjustment. And notice how some of these
are going up and some are going down to create this
effect, it's really great. I can do the same with color,
let's just boost the color, bring out the sky, bring out the
skin tones, and it's that easy, the new photos app, to really
create beautiful images. And that's a quick preview
of photos coming to Yosemite in the future and to
the new photo solution with iCloud photo
library coming with iOS 8. [ Applause ] So now on iOS 8, you
get all your photos in your organization crush
your iOS devices and soon with your Mac and via
the web, Windows as well. Now this is all your
photos and also your videos. And these are in
their original format and their full resolution. Now this uses your
iCloud storage, so your first 5 gigs are free. And we have some great new
affordable plans coming, where you get 20 gigs for just
99 cents a month and 200 gigs for 3.99, so we can all afford to get all our photos
safely up in the cloud. That is photos. [ Applause ] So, a great set of major
features coming to iOS. But of course, there's
always a whole lot more than I have time
to talk about here. I do want to hit on just two
more quickly, and one is Siri. Now, we have-- if you take
your phone and you plug it in for instance in the car,
you can say, "Hey Siri," and start talking to
Siri without having to even touch your phone. And we have song
recognition with Shazam. So now, if you just start up
Siri and there's a song playing around you, it will
tell you what it is and you can even purchase it
right there from within Siri. Siri also now supports
streaming voice recognition. So as you talk, you can
see what it's recognizing. It's more responsive than
ever, and we have support for 22 new dictation languages. Finally, in China we now
have greatly improved maps with vector based maps and
turn by turn directions. We also have support for
lunar calendar which is great for holidays and birthdays. Improved Chinese predictive
input and improved weather data. So that is a look-- thank you. [ Applause ] So that's a look at the
consumer part of iOS 8. To tell you the other
half of the story, I'm going to hand
it back to Tim. Thanks. [ Applause ] >> Thanks, Craig. Amazing new features, and if we
ended the keynote now it would be a giant release. But there is a lot more. The second part of the
story is what iOS 8 provides for developers. And extending your capability to
make even more incredible apps and apps you could
not create before. Now, all of these apps are
delivered via the App Store. The App Store now has over 1.2
million of your apps on it. This is a phenomenal number. And the marketplace around these
apps is unbelievably vibrant, 300,000,000 people visit
the App Store every week. And these people aren't just
browsing, they are downloading. They've now downloaded
over 75 billion apps. These are mind blowing numbers. Now, what we want to do is
make the App Store even better. And so, we're rolling out
a number of new features on the store, starting with
we're adding an Explore tab to help users find the app
they're looking for more. So you can browse through
categories and subcategories. We're adding top
trending searches to make search even better. It's great to see WWDC
at the top by the way. We're making-- finding
your search even better by making it faster by adding
a continuous scrolling list. We're adding related
searches to make it easier to find exactly the
app you're looking for. And with the new
Editor's Choice logo, users can find the best apps. Also for the first time, we're giving the developers the
capability to form app bundles, so users can buy multiple apps-- [ Applause ] I do read your emails. So users can buy multiple apps at a discounted price
with just one tap. Also, we're introducing
app previews, so developers can
make short videos-- [ Applause ] -- so developers can make short
videos of some great features. And the users can make
certain it's an app that they would want. We're also introducing for the
first time today a new service, a new beta test service
called TestFlight. [ Applause ] Developers can invite users
to beta test their app and get the results right in
TestFlight, and it's all free. Now, there are many more
features at the App Store and you hear about
them through the week and in the afternoon sessions but we are really investing
a ton in the App Store. It is a huge release. Everything will be
available in the fall. Now, that brings us to the SDK. And for those of you
that are not developers, the SDK is a Software
Development Kit that enables developers to
make all of the amazing apps. This release is the
biggest release since the launch
of the App Store. And it will give developers
the capabilities and tools to make things that
you haven't dreamed of and to push to a
whole new level. And to tell you all
about the SDK, I want to invite my colleague,
Superman, back to the stage. [ Applause ] >> This is clearly some kind of endurance training
thing Tim is doing to me. So, with this year's SDK, the
team has done just an unreal job with over 4,000 new
developer APIs. Now, I want to start
with something that I think is perhaps
most profound and that's Extensibility. So with Extensibility,
applications from the App Store will be
able to extend the system and offer services
to other apps. [ Applause ] Now of course, one of the reasons we're also
comfortable installing so many apps from the App
Store are iOS' security model. Apps are isolated
inside of sandboxes where they can access their
own data but can't get at your personal information
or mess with other apps without your permission. Well, the handle
Extensibility in an iOS way, we wanted to build on the
same sandboxing model. So now extensions live inside
an application's own sandbox with access to its own data,
but other applications can reach out by way of iOS'
security mechanisms, talk to that extension. That extension can even
project UI right back in to the originating app. Now this enables
some great things. For instance, in addition to the systems built-in
sharing options, an app like Pinterest can
offer share sheet to Safari. And if you look at
actions, for instance, an app like Bing could offer
translation right inside of Safari accessing the web
pages web content right there. Now we're also supporting photo
filters inside the photos, and enabling third parties to define their own
document providers that work within the iCloud
drive-enabled application. Finally, we're enabling third
party apps to define widgets that can now go in
Notification Center. [ Applause ] I think it feels
like time for a demo. So let's start with
photo filters. So, we're back here in photos and I've got a nice
photo here of a flower. And I'm going to go ahead and
edit and you notice an addition to the options here at
the bottom of the screen, we have at the top left
this extensions button. I'm going to click
that, tap that rather. And you notice I have
several extensions available, one from VSCO Cam and
one from Waterlogue. I'm going to select Waterlogue. And now the Waterlogue extension
is able to run right here in the context of photos to
manipulate my photo bringing up their own UI, deliver this
beautiful water color effect to my photo, and when I'm
done, it's right back inside of my photo album,
it's that easy. [ Applause ] Then next let's take
a look at widgets. So I'm going to just pull
down Notification Center. I have my existing widgets
here in my Today view. Did you notice an addition
to my widget is down here at the bottom it says
"One New Widget Available" because I've downloaded
an app recently that contains a Notification
Center widget. So I'm going to tap Edit. And you notice its SportsCenter. So I can tap the plus
next to SportsCenter, position it where I want, I'm
on my widgets in my Today view. Tap Done, and now
I have information on my favorite sports
teams right here inside of Notification Center. Now this works great
on iPad as well. Let's take a look at iPad. So iPad, I'm going to bring
down Notification Center. And you notice I have this
interactive widget from eBay. So, I'm bidding on a guitar and
apparently I'm being outbid. So I can now write inside of
notification, take advantage of the interactivity widgets. I can tap and bid
and just like this, I can submit a leading bid all
inside of Notification Center. Now to wrap it up, I want to
show you extensions in Safari. I'm going to bring up Safari. Use our great new tab view. It's a page I've been looking
at here with some information on a beautiful guitar and I'd
like to learn more about it but, unfortunately, you notice
the text here is in Japanese and I do not read Japanese. Fortunately, I have a Bing
translation extension, so I can just bring
up my action sheet. And you notice down here in
the second row, Bing translate, I'm going to tap on
that and Bing is able to translate this web
page right in line. Look at that. [ Applause ] Now for our extension's
grand finale, let's put that on
my Pinterest board. You see Pinterest has
an extension right here. I'm going to tap on that and
this is actually able to bring up a UI defined by Pinterest
where I can select my board, maybe select my guitar's board. Now the Pinterest
extension is accessed to the underlying
web page, so I can-- let me slide through
the different photos on the page till I find
the one I want to share. That's it. Tap and I pinned it. And that's a quick look
at extensions in iOS 8. [ Applause ] Now there's one important kind
of extension that I did fail to mention and that's
the ability to install system-wide
third party keyboards. [ Applause ] So now if you have special
keyboard you want to use, you can install those in iOS. And by default, those
of course run inside of the most restrictive
sandbox with no network access because we want to make sure
to protect your privacy. But if that keyboard requires
or you want to grant it ability, it can ask for access
to the network to provide extended
functionality. We put those controls
in your hands. That's extensions on iOS 8. [ Applause ] Next up, Touch ID. [ Applause ] From the moment we
introduced Touch ID, developers were excited
about the potential and there's no question why, Touch ID has been
extremely popular and people authenticating
in their devices. If you look at passcode usage on iOS before Touch
ID was less than half. On iPhone 5s 83 percent,
people love using Touch ID. And now, third party
apps can take advantage of Touch ID as well. [ Applause ] So Touch ID protects logins
and user data and it works by unlocking Keychain items. So it identifies successful
fingerprint matches but it always keeps the
fingerprint data itself completely protected inside of the Secure Enclave
in the A7 processor. The fingerprint information
is never exposed to third party apps or the rest
of the system for that matter. It's very secure. That's Touch ID. Then next, Cameras. We're providing Camera APIs
from manual control of exposure, white balance and focus. And we've enhanced the PhotoKit
API with faster performance, the ability not just to
read but also to write to the photo library and this
is now your cloud photo library and perform non-destructive
edits. It's really great. Now, we talked about
the great HealthKit API, but now we'd also have HomeKit. [ Applause ] Now, there are a lot of great
home automation devices coming on the market these days and
they have companion apps, things like lights and
door locks, webcams, garage doors, and thermostats. But, you know, each of them
have their own application and they end up defining
their own network protocol, their own security mechanisms. Well, we thought we could bring
some rationality to the space. We started working
with the leaders in home automation devices. And we've come up with HomeKit
with a common network protocol that has secure pairing
to ensure that only your iPhone
can open your garage door or unlock your door. And in addition to being able
to control individual devices in your home, with HomeKit you
can group devices and changes in the scenes and then with
Siri integration you can say something like, "Get ready
for bed," and be assured that your garage door is
closed, your door is locked, the thermostat is lower, and your lights are
dimmed, that's HomeKit. [ Applause ] Next, CloudKit. So today, if you're a developer and you're writing
an application and it needs a web component,
well, you end up really having to write two apps in one. In addition to the writing in
the client side using Xcode and our frameworks, you have to write the server
side of the app. You have to write server side
app logic, you have to deal with authentication, asset
storage, database storage, search, even push
notifications and then you got to pay somebody to host it all. Well, now, with CloudKit,
CloudKit takes over the cloud part
and provide you with a client side
programming model that lets you access iCloud
authentication storage, search and more. And when it comes to paying, CloudKit is effectively
free, with limits. So, CloudKit scales the
data allocated to your app and bandwidth based on the
number of users using your app. And this goes all the way up
to granting you free a petabyte of assets, 10 terabytes
of database and all the bandwidth you
can constructively use. That is CloudKit. [ Applause ] Next, I want to move on to
something huge in the area of 3D graphics, and
it's called Metal, so-- [ Laughter ] As you know, OpenGL is
the standards based way for high performance 3D graphics
on iOS, giving you access to the power of the
A7 processor. But increasingly, if you look at
what goes on in the performance of the game, in addition to what
the game wants to accomplish, OpenGL ends up being a
thick layer of overhead between the game
and the hardware. Well, now, we have Metal. And Metal dramatically reduces that overhead giving
the game near bare to the metal access
to the power of A7. The results are stunning up
to 10x faster draw call rates. Now, in addition to these
dramatically reduced overheads, you get access not
just to graphics but to the compute
power of the GPU, and Metal supports
pre-compiled shaders and efficient multithreading so you can always get the
most out of the processor. Now, we've been working
with the leading providers of gaming engines
on mobile platforms and what they've been able
to accomplish with Metal in just a few weeks
is truly stunning. Let's start with EA and the
work they've done taking their console level title Plants vs.
Zombies and bringing it to iOS. They're able to put over 1.3
million triangles on the screen at a time and do depth
of motion, effects, depth of field effects that they
could never imagine achieving. In fact, they're using their
Frostbyte console engine that they thought could never
come to mobile and now it can. And let's look at Crytek. Crytek was able to bring their
console-level geom cache to iOS and they were able to get up to 4000 draw calls
per frame going here. This is up to 10x, the kind of performance they
were seeing previously. Now, to show you live what
can be done with Metal, I'd like to bring up the
founder of Epic Games to the stage, Tim Sweeney. Tim, come on up. [ Applause ] >> Thank you. We've had the opportunity
to work with Metal and to illustrate some
of the possibilities, we created a Zen Garden. Now this environment was built in Unreal Engine 4
on a high-end Mac. And now thanks to Metal, we're
running it on iPad in Realtime with full fidelity
and performance. Metal's efficiency enable us
an order of magnitude increase in detail making it possible
for developers like us to create a new generation
of vivid and interactive 3D experiences. Now Josh Adams is the
programmer who wrote much of the code that's running. Josh, can you explain
what we're seeing here? >> Yeah, sure. First of all thanks to Metal
support for precompiled shaders, we can have a huge
variety of materials without a load time impact. And our first stop we'll
check out this cherry tree where I can drag on the
screen to paint the petals on to the tree and they
start falling to the ground. There are about 5,000 petals
here being physically simulated and I can interact with them
by touching on the screen to blow wind through the area. All right, next up we
have a Koi pond filled with hundreds of fish. Metal has freed up enough
CPU time and we can have each of them running their own
artificial intelligence which you can see here as
I drag around the water. And there's a few more fish
here than a real Koi pond but since Metal lets us
do it, we figured why not. And of course every Zen garden
needs some sand to rake. So I go over here I can
rake any pattern I want into the sand here. Now artist love that they
can make an effect like this without needing a
programmer like me to make that one-off effect for
a drop core reduction or other optimizations. And for our final
moment of Zen walk over to this water fountain. Now I can tap on it, pour out
some water which then turns to a couple hundred butterflies but of course not
going to stop there. So I can touch the screen
to call more of them to me and then guide them
around the area. So there are about 3,500
individually animated and rendered butterfly
meshes here. Now I had to keep telling the
artist to turn the numbers up and up because they do not think
it was going to be possible. Pretty cool huh? [ Applause ] >> Thanks. There are thousands of objects
being rendered here and it seem that we couldn't have
dreamed of building prior to Metal delivering
a tenfold increase in rendering efficiency. To have this level of
graphics capability on iPhone and iPad now is a
stunning breakthrough. We're proud to have been a part
of it and of course we'd love to share this with you. So as soon as iOS 8 is
available we will be making that Zen garden available
in the app store for free. Thank you. [ Applause ] >> Its amazing and that was--
it's easy to forget on an iPad. Its incredible graphics
they were able to achieve and I think we are all
feeling very Zen now. So that's very good. So that's Metal. Now I want to move
from high-end 3D gaming to casual gaming in Sprite Kit. We introduced Sprite
Kit last year at WWDC. And it's been a big hit with people building casual
games on the app store. And now this year we've
really enhanced Sprite Kit with some things that make
your casual games just that much more fun. We have support for light
sources, field forces, per-pixel physics that
actually allow your objects to automatically interact
with proper physics based on their drawn shapes and
even inverse kinematics. And now also this year
for the first time on iOS we're bringing SceneKit. [ Applause ] Now SceneKit is a
3D scene renderer and now it's been enhanced
as designed for casual games with an integrated physics
engine, particle systems and support for scripted
actions. So these are two great solutions
for casual games on iOS. Next, Xcode-- [ Applause ] Now Xcode is the tool set we use to build all applications
for the Mac and iOS. And Xcode is in fact one of the most popular
pro-apps on our platform. The last version was
downloaded 14 million times. It's unbelievable. Now of course central to
Xcode is the language we use to develop our apps,
Objective-C. Now Objective-C has served
us so well for 20 years. We absolutely love it. But we had to ask ourselves
the question what would it be like if we had Objective-C
without the baggage of C? [ Laughter ] Well we did more
than think about it. We have a new programming
language. [ Applause ] The language is called Swift
and it totally rules [laughter]. Swift is fast. It is modern. It is designed for safety. And it enables the level of
interactivity and development that you've never
seen on the platform. When it comes to
speed, Swift is great. Compare Python a popular
scripting language with Objective-C, when it
comes to something like, let's say complex object sort. Objective-C is a lot faster. But Swift is faster still. And take something like
RC4 encryption extremely computationally intensive. Python gets utterly crushed
in this particular benchmark. And Objective-- but
look at Swift. Now Swift is also modern
with features like Closures, Generics, Type inference, Multiple return types,
and Namespaces. [ Applause ] You know how many
people at home are going, what the heck are these
guys talking about? [ Laughter ] With Swift you're able to
reduce a common pattern that you might see in your
Objective-C code like this. And reduce it to
something as simple as this. And Swift defines
away large classes of common programming errors
they just aren't possible. Now, Swift is completely native
to Cocoa and Cocoa Touch. It's built with the
same LLVM compiler as Objective-C using the same
Optimizer and Autovectorizer. And it has the same ARC
memory management model. And the same runtime which means that your Swift code can fit
right alongside your Objective-C and your C code in
the same application. [ Applause ] Now Swift also enables a level
dynamism and interactivity in development that
we've never seen before for the feature we
call playgrounds. To demonstrate Swift and
playgrounds in action, I'd like to bring to
the stage Chris Lattner. Come on up Chris. [ Applause ] >> Thank you Craig. I am thrilled to be here
and to be the first person to give you a taste of Swift. Let me show you how fun and interactive it is
to write Swift code. This is the Swift playground, as I start typing I get
an immediately response. It is actually running
my code as I type it and displaying the result
in the sidebar to the right. Of course, Swift
user type inference and has powerful string
processing capabilities which make it as easy to
use as a scripting language without sacrificing
any performance. Swift was designed from
the ground up for Cocoa and Cocoa Touch, so of course
I have their full power at my fingertips. Now, I can build
anything with Swift from a social media
application all the way up to a high-performance,
3D game using Metal. But today to keep it simple, I think I'll write a
simple casual 2D game. Let's start by using NSImage. Let's start by using
NSImage to load a resource. As you can see here, I've-- the playground sees
I've loaded an image, I can ever see it right
here from within Xcode. Now, Swift is loaded with
high-end features like Generics that allow me to get a lot
done with very little code. Here you can see I'm
using an array of strings and using the functional map
algorithm to apply closure to every element which allows
me to load an entire list of images all with the
simple line of code. Now, all these resources of part
of this game that I'm working on and one piece I still need to
finish up is the flight path for the blimp that we have. Now this is a simple loop
that computes the position for the blimp overtime
as my game plays. And in addition to seeing
individual values Swift playgrounds even allow me to
visualize the entire history of a value overtime as
my application runs. And so now I can immediately see that this equation will
cause my blimp to slowly sink as the scene plays out. But I think I can do better and that's not exactly
what I'm looking for. So I can change the code and
I get an immediate response. Simply by changing the equation
the blimp will now rise and fall as the scene plays out
which is a lot more of what I'm looking for. So, now that we have this the
way we want, we can take this and copy it and let's go to
the game that I'm working on. It's right here. Now, this is a playground
just like before. But here, I have a game in the
code written using Sprite Kit. Now, you can see our blimp
going left and right, straight across the scene. And, I can try out
the flight path that we just developed
simply by pasting it in and getting the immediate
feedback I'm looking for. Now, the blimp is rising and
falling just like I wanted. Because Swift enables
such powerful interactive and dynamic programming
experiences, it makes it really easy
to try out new things. And, just by adding
a few lines of code, I can enable Sprite Kit's per
pixel collisions, field forces and lighting effects gaining a
much more interesting result. Now, Swift Playgrounds even
give you full power over time. And, with this timeline at
the bottom of the screen, I can go forwards and backwards through the execution
of my game. So, I can really see
those effects in action. You can see the balloons
interacting with each other and with the blimp
just like that. Playgrounds give me
unprecedented power to see my app in detail and
give me full control when I want to refine and polish
my application. But, of course, Swift
works great with Xcode and runs great on iOS. So, let's now jump and see what
the finished product looks like. Here we go. And, this is the game
that we just built. It looks pretty great. Now, as Craig told you earlier, we've also brought
Scene Kit to iOS. With Scene Kit, it's super easy to build a 3D version
of our game. And, that's just a quick
taste and quick look at Swift. I think you guys are going
to absolutely love it. [ Applause ] Thank you very much. [ Applause ] >> So, that's Swift. It gives you access to all
of Cocoa and Cocoa Touch. So, you can build everything
from a simple example, like you saw there with Chris, to the most powerful
applications you can imagine. And Swift is going to be ready
for primetime out of the gates. It comes with complete
Xcode support with indexing, code completion and debugging. And, there's a Swift language
guide available to you now in iBooks along with complete
reference documentation. And, when iOS and OS X
are available, day one, you can submit apps written
in Swift to the App Store. That is Swift. [ Applause ] So, as you've been able to see, iOS 8 is a huge developer
release and a great end user
release with features like the new QuickType keyboard,
Tap to Talk in Messages, Health, family sharing and
great new photos with iCloud photo library. But, it's also an
unprecedented developer release with technology like
extensions, Metal and Swift. That's iOS 8. It's going to be available to
those of you here in Beta today. [ Applause ] And, you guessed it, available
to everyone else in the fall and it will run on
all of these devices. That is iOS 8. Thank you. [ Applause ] >> Great job. [ Applause ] It's an incredible
set of features and an incredible release. It's been a fun morning. You can probably
see that from us. I hope you've enjoyed
it as well. [ Applause ] Thank you. This morning, you've seen
Yosemite, the future of OS X with an incredible new
design, amazing new features and engineered to work
seamlessly with iOS. You've seen iOS 8, the
biggest release of iOS since the introduction
of the App Store. It's huge for developers and
massive for everyone else. And perhaps, more importantly, you've seen how our
operating systems, devices and services all work
together in harmony. Together, they provide
an integrated and continuous experience
across all of our products. And, you've seen how developers
can extend their experience further than they've
ever done before and how they can create powerful
apps even faster and more easily than they've ever been able to. Apple engineers platforms,
devices and services together, we do this so we can
create a seamless experience for our users that is
unparalleled in the industry. This is something
only Apple can do. You've seen a few people
on stage this morning but there are thousands of
people that made today possible. And I'd like to take a
moment before we depart and recognize them. Would everyone from Apple stand
up that had something to do with bringing today--
making today possible? Stand up, don't be bashful. [ Applause ] Thank you. And, there's thousands more back
in Cupertino who were watching and I want to thank them, too,
and from all over the world. It's a privilege of a lifetime
for me to work with all of these incredible people. I hope everyone has
a huge conference. Enjoy the week. Thank you very much. [ Applause ] [ Music ] [ Music ] >> Hey Siri, what's the fastest way to Steve Jobs Theater? >> Take a right. Then in a quarter mile, take a-- [ Music ] >> Kevin? Shouldn't you be at the event? [ Sound effect ] >> That's a serious upgrade. [ Music ] >> Is that it? [ Music ] Tim, it's here. [ Music ] >> The clicker. [ Music ] >> The clicker. >> The clicker? [ Applause ] >> Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. Good morning. [ Applause ] Thank you. Welcome to the Steve Jobs Theater. Wasn't that a fun video? Things certainly do get hectic around here leading up to days like this, but they're also magical days because we get to share our latest innovations with you. As you know, Apple was founded to make the computer more personal. Of course, first with the Apple 2 and then later with the Mac. Over the years, we've taken this mission further than anyone could have imagined. We've created several categories of technology that have had a profound impact on people's lives. From the iPod to the iPhone to the iPad to the Apple watch, and we've completely reinvented the retail experience, making it more personal and engaging. Our stores have become part of the community. They're open, beautiful, inspiring places to learn and gather. Like this gorgeous store, the Apple Piazza Liberty, it's revitalizing a plaza in the heart of Milan. The store opened to thousands of customers who came to experience a weekend full of events, and we know it's going to be popular for years to come. In fact, our Apple stores are now welcoming over 500 hundred million visitors per year. Thank you. [ Applause ] We love that so many customers had the chance to experience our products first hand and get the personal help that they need to get the most out of them. Of course, we aim to put the customer at the center of everything that we do. That's why iOS is not just the world's most advanced mobile operating system, it's the most personal. We're about to hit a major milestone. We are about to ship our 2 billionth iOS device. [ Applause ] This is astonishing, iOS has changed the way we live, from the way we learn, to the way we work. To how we're entertained, to how we shop, order our food, get our transportation, and stay in touch with one another. And of course, how we capture the moments of our lives and share them with those we love. It's amazing how our mission started with personalizing technology for the desktop to now seeing the many ways that we've made it more personal in so many aspects of our lives. So it's only fitting that today we're going to tell you about two of our most personal products, the ones that are with you everywhere that you go, and how we're going to take them even further. So let's get started with the Apple Watch. Yeah. [ Applause ] We're thrilled by how much the Apple Watch has grown in such a short period of time. I mean to think this category didn't even exist just a few years ago, and now Apple Watch is being embraced by so many people around the world. Apple Watch is not only the number one smart watch in the world, it's the number one watch period. [ Applause ] Apple Watch has redefined what a watch can do for you. It's the integration of breakthrough technology and powerful software and world-class services that bring it to life. For millions of people around the world, Apple Watch has become an indispensable part of their daily lives by helping them stay connected, to be more active, and to live a healthier day. To tell you how we're going to take Apple Watch to the next level, I'd like to invite Jeff. Jeff. [ Applause ] >> Wow, thank you, thank you. We're humbled and inspired by how Apple Watch has become such an important and even essential part of people's lives, and it's becoming more indispensable in three areas in particular. It keeps you connected to the people and information you care about with phone calls and messages and notifications right on your wrist, and cellular lets you stay connected with just your Apple Watch, even if you leave your phone behind. Fitness is at the core of Apple Watch, encouraging you to be more active by closing your rings and tracking your workouts, and now you have built-in GPS. It's swim proof, and it even automatically detects when you're working out. And health. Health has been at the core of Apple Watch as well. Apple Watch put heart rate monitoring right on the wrist, and while you could always check your heart rate, Apple Watch now looks in the background and notifies you if it detects an elevated heart rate. This may seem like a simple change, but we see this in our customer letters. It's a profound change. Apple Watch has become an intelligent guardian for your health. [ Applause ] Today, in each of these areas, staying connected, living an active life, and managing your health we're taking Apple Watch to the next level. And now, I'd like to introduce the next generation of Apple Watch. [ Music ] [ Applause ] Apple Watch Series 4. Everything about it has been redesigned and reengineered. Every detail has been thoughtfully considered and it's just beautiful. [ Applause ] It all starts with a stunning new display. We pushed the screens right to the edges, and we curved the corners to perfectly match the shape of the watch. And the screens are significantly larger. In fact, they're over 30 percent larger. [ Applause ] Thank you. [ Applause ] And we've done this with minimal changes to the case size. Series 4 is thinner, so there's actually less total volume than in Series 3. And to take advantage of the new display, every part of the UI has been redesigned. You'll see more in maps and photo and calendar, and we've created new complications. They look beautiful, and they show even more information and detail. And we've also designed a brand-new watch face with up to eight complications that really brings them to life. And you can customize it with the things you care about. Now, you can add loved ones to your watch face and simply tap to connect with them. Or if you're traveling, you can customize the watch face to track the different time zones. Or maybe you want to create the ultimate health and fitness watch. [ Applause ] We also redesigned the modular face with more detailed and graphical information from apps like stocks and heart rate and activity and even apps from our developers, so now you can track the live score of your favorite team with MLB at Bat. Your boarding information will appear right on your watch face with the Quantas app. Or you can glance at nutritional intake with the Lifesum app. Next, the Breathe app has been a popular way for people to take a moment to be more mindful, and now, the app is available as a watch face, so with a simple raise of the wrist, the watch face will guide you through a deep breath, and there are three beautiful variations to choose from. It's a little hypnotic. It's kind of wonderful. In addition, we've created some dynamic new watch faces that uniquely interact with the shape of the display. With the fire face, see how the flames subtly illuminate the ticks of the dial? And the new water face, notice how the bubbles splash off the edges. And the vapor face, looks amazing with the rich, vibrant colors. We think you're going to love everything about the new displays on Series 4. [ Applause ] Next, let's turn to the digital crown. The digital crown's been completely reengineered, and it now includes haptic feedback, giving you a more responsive and mechanical feel. It's especially great in apps like Podcast and Calendar where you precisely flip through each item. The speaker has also been completely redesigned. It's 50 percent louder, which is great for phone calls and walkie talkie or Siri requests. You ask Siri something on Series 4, and she comes back with volume. You just won't believe the sound you get out of such a small device. We moved the microphone on Series 4 to the opposite side, as far away from the speaker as possible to reduce echo, making phone calls even clearer. And the back of Series 4 is absolutely beautiful. It's made entirely of black ceramic and sapphire crystal, and it's not only beautiful, it's highly functional. Radio waves can now pass through both the front and the back, resulting in improved cellular reception. So this, along with a new speaker and microphone, makes Series 4 even better for staying connected. [ Applause ] Series 4 is just as impressive on the inside. The brain of Series 4 is our fourth-generation silicon in package, or SIP, and we call it S4, and it allows us to build in so many capabilities in such a small device. S4 contains a powerful new dual-core 64-bit processor and a new GPO both custom designed by our Apple silicon team to deliver up to two times faster performance. [ Applause ] On Apple Watch, the accelerometer and gyroscope, they power important experiences like all-day activity tracking or even identifying your swim stroke. Well Series 4 has a next generation accelerometer and gyroscope with twice the dynamic range measuring up to 32 G forces and can sample motion data eight times faster. You probably have no idea what any of that means, but that's okay because we do, and it's allowed us to do something new. One of the leading causes of injuries worldwide is falls. So whether your slip off a step ladder or you trip on a curb, a hard fall can be serious, and it can be difficult to get immediate help. Well now Apple Watch Series 4 can detect a fall. [ Applause ] It's interesting, identifying a fall may sound like a straightforward problem, but it requires a tremendous amount of data and analysis. We conducted studies with thousands of people over a long period of time, and we captured data on real-world falls, and we learned something. We learned that with falls there's this repeatable motion pattern that happens. For example, when you trip, your body will naturally pitch forward, and your arms will go out involuntarily to brace yourself. However, if you slip, there's a natural upward motion of the arms. Well these are motions Series 4 is ideally suited to recognize. With the new accelerometer and gyroscope, the watch analyzes wrist trajectory and impact acceleration to determine when a fall occurs, and after detecting a fall, Series 4 delivers an alert, and from that alert, you can initiate an emergency call. However, if the watch senses you are immobile for one minute, it will start the call automatically. And it also sends a message with your location to your emergency contacts using the SOS feature that is already built into Apple Watch. Fall detection is a feature that we hope you never need, but it's really nice to know it's there. [ Applause ] The optical heart sensor has been essential to Apple Watch from the beginning, and it allows us to calculate the calorie burned during your workouts. It allows to determine your resting heart rate, and it also powers the high heart rate notification that's helped Apple Watch become an intelligent guardian for your health. We wanted to do even more in this space, and so we're announcing three new heart features. First, a notification if your heart rate appears to be too low. Now generally a low heart rate is thought to be a good thing, but if it's too low, it might mean that your heart's not pumping enough blood to the body, and that can be a sign of something serious, and now Apple Watch can detect it. [ Applause ] The second feature is related to heart rhythm, and this is a big deal. Apple Watch can now screen your heart rhythm in the background, and it sends you a notification if it detects an irregular rhythm that appears to be atrial fibrillation. Now, it won't catch every instance of AFib, but we believe this is going to help a lot of people who didn't otherwise know they had an issue. [ Applause ] The first two features, they're powered by the optical sensor. The third feature is made possible by a new electrical heart sensor on Series 4. We've added electrodes into the back sapphire crystal and the digital crown allowing you take an electrocardiogram. [ Applause ] It's otherwise known as an ECG, and this is the first ECG product offered over the counter directly to consumers. [ Applause ] An ECG measures the electrical activity of the heartbeat, and it's used by physicians to help diagnosis certain heart diseases and other conditions. And so now you can take an ECG anytime, anywhere, right from your wrist. You just open the app, and you put your finger on the digital crown. To show you how this works, let's take a closer look. The built-in electrodes in the back crystal and the digital crown, they detect electrical impulses from the heartbeat. They route them to the S4 chip, which converts them to signal for our algorithms. The entire process takes just 30 seconds, and at the completion of the ECG recording, you will receive a heart rhythm classification. If your heart is beating in a normal rhythm, the app will classify the measurement as sinus rhythm, and the app will also classify atrial fibrillation. All ECG recordings, their classifications, the noted symptoms, they're all stored right in the health app in a PDF you can share with your doctor. So now your doctor has a detailed picture of your heart rhythm, similar to a lead one ECG that is usually only obtained in the clinic. And to give you his thoughts on this, I'd like to invite to the stage the president of the American Heart Association, and also a practicing cardiologist, Dr. Ivor Benjamin. [ Applause ] >> Thank you, Jeff. I'm inspired by the life-saving potential of technology and applaud Apple's innovation and commitment to health. Capturing meaningful data about a person's heart in real time is changing the way we practice medicine. In my experience, people often report symptoms that are absent during their medical visits. That is why information is vital, information about a person's daily lifestyle choices and their specific health data. The ability to access health data on on-demand electrocardiogram or ECG is game changing. Especially when evaluating atrial fibrillation and irregular and often rapid heart rate that can increase a person's risk of stroke, heart failure, and other health-related complications. At the American Heart Association, we are committed to educate and empower people, to be proactive in all areas of their health and general well-being. The American Heart Association is a relentless force for a world of longer, healthier lives. Products that seek to provide deeper health insights like the Apple Watch Series 4 offer great potential in getting us there. Thank you. Back to you Jeff. [ Applause ] >> Thanks Dr. Benjamin. It's great to have the support of the American Heart Association, and I'm also pleased to say, we've received clearance from the FDA. [ Applause ] And this is a de novo clearance, which means it's the first of its kind. Also, the irregular heart rhythm alert has also received FDA clearance. Both of these features will be available to U.S. customers later this year, and we're working hard to bring them to customers around the world. [ Applause ] I just have to show you when you open the app, this is what you see on the watch face. It's really beautiful. People in general don't like things that are medical. This kind of makes you want to take an ECG. It's amazing to think that the same watch you wear every day to make phone calls and respond to messages, track your activity, like even run a marathon can now take an ECG. [ Applause ] Apple Watch Series 4 is the ultimate guardian for your health, the best fitness companion, and the most convenient way to stay connected. And with all these amazing features, of course, your data is still protected. At Apple we believe your personal information belongs to you, you should decide who you share it with, and who gets to see it, period. [ Applause ] All your health and fitness data, it's encrypted on device and in cloud. So Apple Watch Series 4, larger display, brand new UI, digital crown with haptics, up to two times faster performance, a louder speaker, fall detection, and an industry first built-in electrical heart sensor capable of taking an ECG and of course cellular, GPS, altimeter, swim proof, and I probably missed some things. We also have the most advanced wearable operating system watch OS5. So with all of these features in a slimmer design, you're probably wondering about battery life. Well, I'm pleased to tell you that Series 4 has the same 18-hour, all-day battery life that our customers enjoy on Apple Watch. [ Applause ] And we've increased the outdoor workout time to six hours, so you can have full GPS tracking, which is perfect for those marathons or long bike rides. And of course, Apple Watch has been designed and manufactured in an environmentally friendly way. We created a video about Series 4, and I'd like to show that to you now. [ Background Noise ] >> Apple Watch Series 4 is more than an evolution. It represents a fundamental redesign and reengineering of Apple Watch. [ Music ] >> While retaining the iconic design, we've developed and refined the form, also managing to make it thinner. The new display is now over 30 percent larger and is seamlessly integrated into the product. The interface has been redesigned for our new display, providing more information with richer detail. The hardware and the software combine to define a very new and truly integrated singular design. Navigating with the digital crown, already one of the most intricate mechanisms we've ever created, has been entirely reengineered with haptic feedback delivering a precise mechanical feel as you scroll. In addition to an optical heart sensor, there is a new Apple-designed electrical heart sensor that allows you to take an electrocardiogram or ECG to share with your doctor, a momentous achievement for a wearable device. Placing a finger on the digital crown creates a closed circuit with electrodes on the back, providing data the ECG app uses to analyze your heart rhythm. While understanding heart health is essential to our well-being, additional features and enhancements encourage us to live an overall healthier, more active life. The accelerometer, gyroscope, and altimeter allow you to record new types of workouts, measure runs with increased precision, and track your all-day activity with great accuracy. Enhanced cellular connectivity enables something truly liberating, the ability to stay connected with just your watch. Phone calls, music streaming, and even emergency assistance are all immediately available from your wrist. Apple Watch Series 4 is a device so powerful, so personal, so liberating, it can change the way you live each day. [ Applause ] >> Series 4 will be available in three aluminum finishes, silver, gold, and space gray, and the stainless collection is absolutely beautiful with polished and space black. We've shipped stainless before, but there's something about Series 4 that is even more gorgeous, and there's a brand-new finish, gold stainless, which is wonderful paired with this Milanese loop. [ Applause ] All band colors and band styles fit any generation of Apple Watch, so all those Series 4 customers, all the bands that you already own will work just fine on the Series 4. [ Applause ] For customers who love Nike Plus, especially runners, it's been optimized for Series 4 with full-screen watch faces that look great, and they've done something really cool with the Nike sport loop. They've added reflective yarn for night-time visibility. [ Applause ] Apple Watch Hermes continues this Fall with some bold new looks. There's these gorgeous color blocks on the watch face, and they change with the passage of time, and they look really wonderful paired with the new Double Tour bands. [ Applause ] Apple Watch Series 4 with GPS starts at $399. Series 4 with cellular starts at $499, and we're keeping Series 3 in the line at more affordable prices, starting at just $279. [ Applause ] Series 4 GPS will be available in 26 markets at launch. Series 4 with cellular will start in 16 markets with 34 carriers, that's more than twice the number of carriers we had last year. You can order Series 4 starting Friday, and it will be available the following Friday, September 21st. Series 3 at the new prices is available right after the show, and watchOS 5, the most advanced wearable operating system will be available on September 17. That's Apple Watch, and now back to Tim. [ Applause ] >> Thanks Jeff. [ Applause ] Thank you. [ Applause ] I could not be more excited about the Apple Watch Series 4. Apple Watch is really redefining what a watch can do for you. Now we made a video about how the Apple Watch is inspiring people all around the world to be more active, and I'd love to run it for you now. I think you're going to get a kick out of it. [ Music ] >> You put your right arm in, you put your right arm out, you put your right arm in, and you shake it all about. You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around, that's what it's all about. Left foot. You put your left foot in, you put your left foot out, you put your left foot in, and you shake it all about. >> Hey honey, let's go running. >> You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around, that's what it's all about. [ Music ] You put your left arm in, you put your left arm out, you put your left arm in, and you shake it all about. You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around, that's what it's all about. >> Whole self. >> You put your whole self in, you put your whole self out, you put your whole self in, and you shake it all about. You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around, that's what it's all about. >> That's what it's all about. >> That's what it's all about. [ Applause ] >> We really love what the Apple Watch is doing to get the world moving. So that is Apple Watch. Now let's talk about iPhone. [ Applause ] iPhone X defined the future of the smartphone. It introduced new technologies that is at the cutting edge of what's possible. With a stunning, all-stream design and intuitive gestures, with technologies like the TrueDepth camera system and Face ID, where your phone knows what you look like, and your face becomes your password. iPhone X has an incredible camera system that uses intelligent software to make the most stunning portraits. This was only previously possible with pro-level equipment. And there are so many other innovative technologies that are built right in, and of course all of them are powered by the world's most advance mobile operating system, iOS. iPhone X has changed the industry, and along the way, it became the number one smartphone in the world. [ Applause ] But what's most important to us is that it's the most loved smartphone with an amazing 98 percent customer satisfaction. [ Applause ] Now, today, we're going to take iPhone X to the next level. I'm excited to show you what is by far the most advanced iPhone we have ever created. [ Music ] [ Applause ] This is iPhone XS. It is the most advance iPhone we've ever created, and I'd like to invite Phillip to tell you all about it. Phil. [ Applause ] >> Good morning everyone. I am so excited to tell you all about iPhone XS. It is made of a surgical-grade stainless steel. It has a gorgeous new gold finish on the front and on the glass. It is the most beautiful iPhone we have ever made. [ Applause ] The screen goes top to bottom, edge to edge, rounded into the corners. And it's covered on the front and the back with a new formulation of glass that is the most durable glass ever in a smartphone. [ Applause ] iPhone XS comes in three finishes, gold, silver, and space gray. They are beautiful, and they're protected from dust and liquids to an even higher level now. IP68, that means it's protected to two meters for up to 30 minutes. So if you happen to be hanging by the pool, drop your phone in the water, don't worry. Dive down, grab it, rinse it, let it dry, you'll be fine. [ Applause ] And the team tested it in my different liquids, in chlorinated water, salt water, orange juice, tea, wine, even beer. This is some of the most fun, intense testing we get to do at Apple. The screen on iPhone XS is a Super Retina display, the best we've made yet. It's an OLED display, 5.8 inches on the diagonal, and it's 2.7 million pixels, 458 pixels per inch, the highest quality display on an iOS device. Now let's put it side by side with our plus size phone, an iPhone 8 Plus, and as you can see, it's as big a display as the plus size phone but in a smaller design, and so many customers love that about that, big display, easy, comfortable to hold in your hand. And it looks incredible. Watching movies on it, the latest HDR movies like Lego Batman, using the latest formats, Dolby Vision, HDR10. Your photos look stunning on iPhone XS. You shoot them with beautiful, wide color, and they display better than ever on the new Super Retina display because it has a 60 percent greater dynamic range for colors in your photos than the iPhone X's display. It is gorgeous. Well the iPhone XS is not just one but two sizes of display, the 5.8 inch and a new 6.5 inch Super Retina display. [ Applause ] This is the biggest display ever on an iPhone. It is an OLED display as well, 3.3 million pixels, 458 pixels per inch again. Now a lot of our customers have loved the plus size iPhone. So let's put that side by side. You can see, it's about the same size phone with a much larger display. We think there are a lot of customers who are going to love this larger display. Now, the 5.8 inch, we already said was as big as a plus size display, so what do you call a phone that's bigger than plus size? Well, we call it the iPhone XS Max. [ Applause ] And the Max is an incredible experience. Watching videos on it is cinematic. Looking at your photos bigger than ever is incredible. Surfing the web, looking at fly overs in Map, even when you're using some of the built-in apps, the team's taken advantage of the wider display when it's in horizontal mode to give you a split view like here in contacts. It's awesome for editing videos in iMovie for creating songs with Garage Band and even playing immersive killer games is so much fun on the iPhone XS Max. So, there are two Super Retina displays now, 5.8 inch, 6.5 inch, both OLED displays, both a million to one contrast ratio, they're HDR displays. They have fast 120 Hertz touch-sensitive layer, that's how it gets its smooth scrolling really fast typing and gaming response. They both have 3D touch for pressure sensitivity. They have tap to wake. They have incredible color management. They're true tone display, so the paper white looks just right in all the different lighting that you use it, and they have wide color. These are amazing displays. And we've matched them to incredible sound systems as well. Stereo sound, better than in any iPhone today. Now, with the 10S, you get a wider stereo field. The team has matched powerful speakers with great software to deliver an even richer sound experience. So watching movies sounds incredible. And playing games, like Alto Odyssey, which previously you put on headphones. Now you just want to listen through the speakers because of that beautiful wide stereo sound. Of course, listening to music and watching music videos like the Foo Fighters sounds better than ever. All right. Let's talk about Face ID. Face ID is a huge step forward in biometric protection for all of our personal data on our devices, and customers love it. It is powered by our TrueDepth camera system. And there's so much technology in that little space right there. An infrared camera, flood illuminator, proximity sensor, ambient light sensor, dot projector, front camera, speaker and microphone, all working together to give protection to the data on our devices. And they're designed with multiple neural networks, so it's secure and seamless in the iPhone experience. With iPhone XS, you just pick up your iPhone, look at it, it recognizes your face and unlocks your notifications and information. And it does it faster than ever before because the XS now has faster algorithms and runs on a faster version of the secure enclave, so it's gotten even better. Face ID works remarkably well. In fact, we're proud to say it is the most secure facial authentication ever in a smartphone. [ Applause ] Powering Face ID in everything we do on the iPhone is our A series chip, and the team has worked so hard to make every generation of the A series chip better than any and ever in a smartphone, and this year is no exception. What the team has done is truly, truly, breakthrough. It's called the A12 Bionic. [ Applause ] And the A12 Bionic is the industry's first seven nanometer chip, and that's a huge breakthrough, yes. [ Applause ] The A12 Bionic is packed with 6.9 billion transistors, and what the team has done with all that is remarkable. So let's go through some of the things in this chip. We're going to talk about the CPU, the GUP, and the neural engine. Let's start with the CPU. It's an Apple designed 6-core CPU, this is a fusion system. It has two high-performance cores, four high-efficiency cores. The two high-performance cores run up to 15 percent faster than the cores in the A11 Bionic while also being 40 percent more energy efficient. And the high efficiency cores are up to 50 percent more energy efficient, and all six cores can run at once. The GPU, well this is an Apple designed GPU. It is so powerful. Now the A11 GPU was already ahead of anything else in the industry. The A12 GPU is now up to 50 percent faster than the A11, so a huge jump in graphics performance. But the real advancement, the real blow-away thing is this neural engine. Now you know we introduced the first neural engine last year with the A11 Bionic. With the A12 Bionic, we take it much further. The A11 was a 2-core design. This is an 8-core dedicated machine-learning engine to power all that great machine learning software on our systems, and it has a smart compute system. What that means, it's able to analyze the neural network data and figure out on the fly whether to run it on the CPU, the GPU, or the neural engine. I mean this is breakthrough, and the performance is unmatched. We told you last year that A11 Bionic could process an insane 600 billion operations per second. Well the A12 Bionic is able to process 5 trillion operations per second. [ Applause ] Unbelievable. [ Applause ] Now the A12 Bionic is a complete system on a chip, so there's so much more. And the team works very hard to be just as innovative at every one of these things in the A12 Bionic. It has a next generation image single processor, incredible video coders and decoders. There's our display engine, our audio system. Of course, it has a secure enclave. It has memory controllers, storage controllers. The Apple designed storage controller and the A12 Bionic can now address twice as much internal storage as previously. So now you can have up to 512 gigabytes of internal storage if you want. That's a half a terabyte on your iPhone in your pocket. That's enough for over 200,000 photos stored on your iPhone. It is incredible. [ Applause ] This A12 Bionic is without question the smartest and most powerful chip ever in a smartphone. [ Applause ] So much of the experience we have with iPhone is driven by this chip, and it's going to enable us to have so many great new experiences not possible before. So I'm very excited to bring out Kaiann Drance to show you just what we can do with iPhone and Kaiann is our senior director of iPhone product marketing. Kaiann. [ Applause ] >> Thank you, Phil, thank you. [ Applause ] A12 Bionic was designed for iPhone, not any other smartphone. This is one smartphone. This is one of the reasons why our team can deliver a chip design for incredible performance, great battery life for everything iPhone needs, from our everyday tasks to our most advanced technologies, such as every time you look at your phone and unlock it with Face ID, or playing an immersive game on our edge-to-edge Super Retina display and each time you take a remarkable photo. Every single thing you do touches the chip, the CPU, the GPU, or any other powerful component all throughout, best in class, and designed for iPhone for the very best performance. So, next time you unlock your phone, perhaps launch photos, searching through the thousands of photos you have to find just the one you're looking for, deciding how to share it amongst different apps such as messages, and then moving onto the next thing, with multitasking, perhaps landing in Maps to find direction. A12 Bionic makes these everyday tasks feel fast and effortless. And, A12 Bionic with the performance updates in iOS 12 helps apps launch up to 30 percent faster. [ Applause ] So we're focused on these everyday experiences, but even beyond that, such as those that make use of machine learning. Now, we've used machine learning for a number of years now to make our features even better, such as quick type suggestions in messages, in memories, how we curate your photos and videos, getting real-time suggestions in Maps when you need them, our true-tone adaptive display, and of course finding the very best photo of your cat or other pet. But what's really remarkable this year is that our next generation neural engine unlocks the power of real-time machine learning. This is incredibly important for apps like camera, and we use that depth information for portrait mode and portrait lighting. In Animoji, mapping those 50 different facial muscles over your face in a live Facetime call. That is computationally really intense. And of course our immersive AR experiences, our fun new Memoji, and the new Clicks app launching this fall will make use of portrait segmentation on the neural engine for even better selfie scenes, like the one you see here in Incredibles 2. At iOS 12 we're also announcing and launching Siri shortcuts, so you can get even more done with just a tap or by asking Siri to help. You can easily create a shortcut with multiple steps, like the one I used this morning. Let's take a look. I just press and hold or ask Siri to run my keynote day shortcut. Now the first you'll do, it'll kick off my HomeKit enabled accessories, then it'll order my morning coffee. And it'll tell me how long it takes for me to go pick it up. And then it will kick off the reminder I set to not forget my badge, get me driving directions, and start my music playlist, and here we go. And this is just one of many things that you can do with Siri shortcuts. [ Applause ] We're really excited this year to be opening up our neural engine to Core ML, and Core ML is going to get a lot faster. It's going to get up to nine times faster. [ Applause ] But it's going to run with as little as one-tenth the energy. This is tremendous. It means developers can run their most complex, most advanced neural networks in their apps and do so even more often. Then freeing up the power of a GPU for more immersive graphics like never before, which by the way is really useful for augmented reality, and this is another area that we're focused on. That camera view finder has turned into a wonderful window to these new AR experiences, such as this app here called Fishing Go, that lets you turn your surroundings into this immersive marine aquarium where you can discover more than 200 species of sea life. iPhone XS is the best platform for AR. We custom calibrate our cameras and sensors for the best AR experience. In A12 Bionic, the GPU helps us render realistic graphics, the ISP for real-world lighting, and the neural engine for object reflections and more. And it joins the best AR software with ARKit 2, where apps can access enhanced surface and object detection, persistent experiences, multiple users, and we've even included a new Measure app built-in. And with AR Quick Look, you can look at a 3D object like this one here in Safari and with just a tap bring it out into the real world. Isn't that amazing? [ Applause ] So you've heard some examples today of how A12 Bionic is accelerating real-world everyday scenarios but also enabling new experiences, but it doesn't end with us. It also extends out to our talented pool of developers and that wonderful ecosystem where they have access to the best software with iOS 12 and the A12 Bionic. This takes us to the next generation of apps, and we're thrilled to have three developers here today to show you what's possible in just a short amount of time. Now, our first developer is making use of the CPU and GPU to take their game to the next level of impact. Please welcome Todd Howard, game director of Bethesda Game Studios. [ Applause ] >> Thanks Kianne. Thank you. You know, I wrote my first game when I was 12 on an Apple 2, and I got to tell you, I took full advantage of every single one of those low res 40 x 40 pixels. And it's amazing how far we've come. With the technology that is packed into our phones, we can now start reaching for games that are more than simple diversions but experiences that can truly transport you. And with the new iPhone, we've been able to do just that. Let's take a look at our new Elder Scrolls game, Blades. Like series is known for, it is a massive, first-person role-playing game full of stories, quests, and an incredible world to explore. You play one of the blades, the empire's elite warriors, and you'll define your own character and how you want to engage in combat. You can use defense, melee, or magic. And on the iPhone's OLED screen, we can pull out all of the detail that you'd usually miss in the bright and the dark areas. You can see the lighting from these crystals bloom, reflect off of the water. We can have that lighting bounce off of the walls. And we can even have it reflect off of your sword. Additionally, we can use the new stereo widening on the iPhone so you can hear the forest around you, all without headphones. And scenes like this used to only be possible in your living room on a high-end gaming console. We can do them now on your phone while doing full-screen post-processing, all while rendering 40 percent faster than before. You'll see the sword follows Craig's specific movements and timings. It feels incredible, and that new depth of field camera effect really lets you focus your actions during combat. And spiders are just terrifying. We've been able to pull off some incredible environments that just weren't possible before. Twelve-year-old me would not be able to comprehend all of these pixels, all 2.7 million of them. As we [inaudible] we can use the power of the phone to bring all those parts together, the visuals, the sound, and even haptic feedback on your attacks. It's not just immersive. It transports you. You may have fought dragons in Skyrim, but you've never experienced the Elder Scrolls like this and on your phone. Blades is coming to iOS this Fall. It's available for preorder right now. We'll see you out there. [ Applause ] Thank you, Todd. Now our next developer is going to enable an entirely new use case for the iPhone camera using Core ML. Here's David Lee, CEO of NexTeam, and Steve Nash, two-time NBA MVP and a new member of the Basketball Hall of Fame. [ Applause ] >> Thanks Kianne. HomeCourt is an app that used Core ML to track basketball shots by simply pointing your iPhone at a court. >> When I was young and learning the game, I never really knew if I was doing the right things to improve my game. I would spend hours and hours shooting by myself, just hoping I was refining the techniques that would take me to the next level. I've been working closely with the HomeCourt team on a tool that will revolutionize basketball training, and I can't wait to show you what we can do with the new iPhone. >> We couldn't bring a basketball court here, so we went out last week and saw Steve training an athlete. We now have a screen recording of our app on a new iPhone. Let's take a look. The app recognizes the hoop and the court automatically. Tap start, it will start tracking real-time shot attempts, the makes indicated by the dot on the floor and misses by the red X's drawn as an overlay right on the court. With the new iPhone and Core ML 2 we see a massive performance game that allows us to do a lot more. The powerful A12 Bionic [inaudible] models run up to nine times faster, and that unlocks new features that were not possible before. Let's take a look at what's going on under the hood. Only on a new iPhone we can run real-time player tracking, real-time post estimation, real-time ball detection, and trajectory estimation all at the same time. We call this real-time shot science, that tracks six metrics for every single shot the player takes. These insights are not visible to the naked eye. >> To become a great shooter, you need to practice every day. You need to shoot at game speed and with the right posture. I focus my students on staying low and stable when they shoot. HomeCourt is giving players immediate feedback to help them understand if they are practicing with the right form. Release time is also a great indicator of whether the player is shooting at game speed while staying low. These meaningful insights and feedback just weren't possible before. >> Where you see that release time from the set, it will be displayed on screen, and app can also give audio feedback for the [inaudible] stereo speaker or your earbuds. >> As players train with real-time feedback, they build muscle memory. I really wish that when I was younger we had these tools. HomeCourt is great for every basketball player who wants to get better, whether you're a beginner or a pro. >> The most amazing part is this is all done with just your new iPhone. There are no sensors on the player, no sensor on the ball, and no sensor on the court, and that's HomeCourt real-time shot science, shipping as an update this Fall. Thank you. [ Applause ] >> Thank you Dave and Steve. Wow, that was something. Okay. So our third app makes use of AR to do even more in a game. Here is Atli Mar, CEO of Directive Games. [ Applause ] >> Thanks Kianne. Playing with friends at the arcades has always been a lot of fun. Generations of gamers have enjoyed countless hours playing some of the world's best titles. And now in AR, we are able to have our own arcade cabinet wherever and whenever we want. And with ARKit 2, multiple players are able to share the same AR experiences. Joining me here are my friends, and they are eager to climb the leader boards. Andrea, Shai-Hi, Alessandra. Are you guys ready? >> We're ready to battle, Atli. >> This is Galaga AR. [explosion noise] Just like the classic, you eliminate your enemies, you avoid being attacked, and you grab power ups. [ Game sounds ] With the digital GPU Core, we are able to render scenes like the sun effect. This is something that we could not do before. [ Game sounds ] And the new iPhone stereo widening makes things sound really immersive. Just listen to this epic [inaudible] battle. [ Game sounds ] [ Applause ] Last year, we shipped our first AR game, and now, with new features of ARKit 2 and the power of the new iPhone, we are able to craft experiences at a much higher fidelity as well as connect players both digitally and in the physical world. Look for the first game in our AR arcade series on the App Store later this year. Thank you. [ Applause ] >> Wow. Wow. We can't wait for you guys to experience those apps and games. This is really just the beginning. We're scratching the surface of what's going to be possible on the iPhone XS and the A12 Bionic. No other chip in the world would allow us to do this. Thank you and now back to Phil. [ Applause ] >> Thank you, Kianne. [ Applause ] The A12 Bionic just powers so many incredible new experiences, and that includes the camera. We all love the cameras in our iPhone. No doubt, you all know it is the world's most popular camera and for great reason. Over ten years customers have been taking incredible photographs with their iPhone cameras like this and sharing them with us around the world and telling us stories with them. And we're so proud of all the people who use the iPhone camera from consumers to even increasingly professionals are using them for photos like this. This is a beautiful portrait photo, but what makes us so proud of it is that it appeared on the cover of Time Magazine. [ Applause ] And this is their issue for women who are changing the world, and we couldn't be prouder to be a part of that story. Well, you are going to be blown away with the pictures you can take with the iPhone XS's camera. It is a remarkable new dual-camera system. It has a 12-megapixel wide camera, a 12-megapixel telephone camera, and an even more improved true-tone flash. The 12-megapixel wide camera has a new sensor, a larger sensor with bigger, deeper pixels. It has optical image stabilization and our fast 1.8 aperture lens. It's Apple's six-element lens. The telephoto camera is also a 12-megapixel camera, also optical image stabilization, F2.4, Apple design lens. On the front side, we have the true-depth camera system, and that's a new sensor as well. A 7-megapixel sensor that's twice as fast, and it works together with the IR camera and the dot projector, so it can create depth in your portrait-mode photos. And as we talk about cameras, of course everyone talks about the sensors and the lens and rightly so. They're an important part of the camera system. But increasingly what makes incredible photos possible aren't just the sensor and the lens, but it's the chip and software that runs on it. And this is so true with iPhone photography. So, for example, in the A12 Bionic is the image signal processor, working together with the CPU. And it does so many things every time we take a picture. It automatically sets exposure, white balance, sets the focus, does noise reduction and low light photography. It brings out highlights and details, and it can fuse multiple images together like when you do an HDR photo or create a beautiful panorama. And the ISP and the A12 Bionic does all of this better than ever before, but what it does that is entirely new is connect together the ISP with that neural engine to use them together to make our photos incredible. So, for example, the CPU, and the neural engine can work together to do detection of people's faces and bodies, to understand the scene that you're shooting, and can do facial landmarking. So it recognizes exactly where the eyes are and does instant red eye reduction that looks perfect. And it creates better segmentation masks so even with portrait mode the hair and the glasses are better than ever before. This is an amazing amount of power for our camera team. In fact, when you take a photo, it's capable of doing a trillion operations on every photo you take. [ Music ] And what the team is doing with that power is truly remarkable. We have a brand-new feature we call Smart HDR. And we all know what HDR is, right. You can take a couple photos and merge them together to bring out highlight and shadows and keep your subject looking great. Well, Smart HDR takes this idea so much further. So let's say you're taking a picture, and the camera recognizes you're shooting a subject and the subject is moving, you go to press down on the shutter and you get a picture instantly. It's called zero shutter lag. What the A12 Bionic is actually doing is shooting a four-frame buffer so it can capture that critical moment. The A12 Bionic is doing even more than that. It's also capturing secondary interframes at the same time, and those interframes are shot at a different exposure level to bring out highlight details. And it's doing more than that. It's shooting a long exposure so we can get better shadow detail as well. And when you're taking that picture, it's analyzing all of those, finding out how to match up the best parts of each and merge them into one perfect photo. That's Smart HDR. It is a breakthrough, and it makes taking photos easier than ever and to get beautiful results. [ Applause ] So let me show you a few photos shot with iPhone XS, not retouched in any way, no exterior lighting used, anything else. It's just straight from the camera. So here's one. I mean this is stunning. You're subject beautifully lit with natural light, beautiful skin tones, great detail, and a nice beautiful soft background. But what's remarkable about this photo is it was a windy day by the water, and her hair was blowing. Yet you still get that incredible detail in her hair on this Smart HDR photo. Here's another example. As you can see, this is what you're not supposed to do, right, shooting a photo into the sun, because that's going to blow out the exposure. But Smart HDR makes sure we got a great sky, we got detail on the shadows of the water, but most of all, look at the water drops coming off of his hair and how crisp and detailed they are. That's incredible. All your photos come out so much better now with iPhone XS no matter what your subject matter, people, pets. Look at the skin detail and the hair and the beautiful sky. Like we said, it shoots wide color photos as well. Look at the color range on this photo. Shot straight off iPhone XS. And it looks even better with the higher dynamic range display on the iPhone XS when you look at it there. We introduced portrait mode and portrait lighting photos. Those are better than ever before, and here's an example. It's incredible the level of detail. This is the stage light feature and the portrait lighting. It looks so beautiful. Here's another portrait lighting photo, excuse me, portrait mode photo. Beautiful soft background. These are better than ever before, and there's a huge advancement here. Remember the area on the background of the photo, the quality of that blur is what the industry calls bokeh. And the team wanted to make a big advancement in what can be done with bokeh, and they've done some amazing work here. They studied some of the highest-end full-frame cameras and expensive fast lenses to characterize the quality of professional bokeh and then bring that capability to more and more of us through the portrait mode photos that we can take with iPhone, and what they've achieved is really breakthrough. So I'm going to show you a photo now, and I'll just tell you right up front, this was not shot with a high-end expensive camera. This was shot with an iPhone XS, and it is breakthrough. It is absolutely beautiful. The detail on her face, the great skin tones, obviously reflecting from the surface of the car to light it up, but that background, and the quality of that bokeh is remarkable. This is a breakthrough in photography for a smartphone. But further than that, the team discovered something remarkable. This is so, so exciting. I can't tell if you can tell I'm excited about this, but this is-- so when you take the picture with portrait mode, and then you go in to the photos app, and you tap edit, you're going to see a new slider on the bottom that says depth. Yeah, someone said no. Get ready for this, because let me blow it up, you're going to have to watch two things at once. You're going to watch the depth, and you're going to watch the background. You can, after taking the picture, adjust the depth of field, so that's 1.4, that's 16. [ Applause ] And the background is changing with it. Let's do that again. We're going to slide a depth of field, and watch the background as it changes the depth of field of your photo. This is done after you've taken it. This has not been possible in photography with any kind of camera. This is something that iPhone can now do with the power of the A12 Bionic chip. Let me show you one more example. [ Applause ] Here's another photo shot with iPhone XS, and we see a beautiful background with incredible higher quality bokeh, and as we looked at it, we slide and we selected f2.0 because we thought it had just the right depth of field we want in the photo. This is a new era of photography. Some people call it computational photography. With a power of not only the sensor and the lens, but the A12 Bionic and incredible software and the care the camera team has put to creating high-quality photography is making images possible now that weren't before. And the benefits of this, not only for photography, but for video as well, it's a new era of videography as well, but this new sensor and the power of that A12 Bionic chip. And it can do many things. It has a twice as fast sensor. It can take advantage of a lot of this technology to give better image quality in our videos. And there's something else the team has done too. Taking advantage of the four microphones built into iPhone XS, you can record stereo sound with your videos as well. And it plays back with that beautiful wide stereo field, and it sounds amazing. So let me show you a quick video that was shot with iPhone XS, just natively shot on it, nothing done to it other than we edit it for length, and it's shot in low light, and it creates images that weren't possible before. Here we are. >> Hey, what's up. You made it up here. >> Yeah. Had a little drive in. [ Background Noise ] [ Applause ] And that's a beautiful video. You just shoot it, 4K, but there's a lot going on that the system is doing for us. Autofocus, auto exposure, bringing up the highlight details, the shadow details with wider dynamic range, amazing color rendering and tone mapping and stereo sound being recorded automatically. So that's photography. That's video. That's our camera. Now I'll talk about battery life. Increasingly, all smart phone users want more performance, bigger screens, but longer battery life too. The teams really worked hard on this. iPhone XS is able to compared to iPhone X get you up to 30 minutes longer in your day than iPhone X did, and that's really great. iPhone XS Max has the biggest battery we've ever put into an iPhone, and it can get you up to an hour and a half longer in your day. [ Applause ] And there's a lot more new with iPhone XS and XS Max. Faster networking, gigabit-class LTE. They have more bands than any other smartphone, so they have the best worldwide roaming and speaking of worldwide capabilities, one thing we've had requests for is dual SIM capability. Well some of you know what this is for. For the rest, here are some reasons people want dual SIM. Some people want two phone numbers on their phone. Maybe a home number and a work number. Some want two different plans depending on the region of the world they're in and what they need. And many of us like to travel and want to keep our local phone number but may need to get a data plan in a region we're in so we can have access to fast data there. To do this, into iPhone XS and XS Max, we built a technology called DSDS, or Dual SIM Dual Standby. This means that you have both phone numbers there in your phone waiting to get call, whichever one gets it becomes the active line. And to enable that, the we've added our eSIM technology. eSIM is a standard that we've been working with carriers to promote around the world. We've actually already been shipping it in cellular iPads, in cellular watches, and now we're bringing it to iPhone. So with eSIM it's built in, easy to set up a second line. You can point your camera at a QR code from a carrier and set it up, and the team has worked to make sure in the software that the fact that you have two different phone numbers is understood. And you can name them home and work, primary and secondary, whatever. And then throughout the user experience, you'll see that a phone call is coming in on a certain line, and you know how to deal with that. Support for eSIM requires support from carriers, and we've been working with many great carrier partners, and they're going to be rolling out eSIM support throughout the fall and many more into next year. We're really, really happy to be working with them on this. So that's how we provide dual SIM support around the world. We will have a single physical SIM and a eSIM in both iPhone XS and XS Max. In China, where we can't bring eSIM into iPhone yet, we're making a special model of the iPhone XS Max that has two physical SIMs, actually one on each side of the SIM tray. It's a really smart implementation, and we think they're going to love that. [ Applause ] So this is iPhone XS and XS Max. They are packed with so many new advancements. Better Super Retina displays, 5.8 inch and the new 6.5 inch OLED displays. Our next generation 7 nanometer A12 Bionic chip with faster CPU, GPU, neural engine, and helping us to deliver even longer battery life. Our new generation dual camera system with a bigger sensor, Smart HDR, portrait mode with more beautiful bokeh, dynamic depth of field, higher quality videos with HD and 4K, new true-depth camera system that's faster for Face ID, gigabit-class LTE, beautiful new gold finish, protection to IP68 and so much more. These are incredible new iPhones. And the team works really hard to make these iPhones in the most environmentally friendly manner possible. And to tell you a little bit more about that, I'm really excited to bring out Lisa. [ Applause ] >> Thanks Phil. You know, we never stop thinking about what's best for the planet. This starts with our products, but it extends to everything we do at Apple. So, for instance, earlier this year we announced something pretty amazing. You may have heard about it already, but we can't help repeating ourselves because we now run Apple on 100 percent renewable energy at all of our facilities worldwide. [ Applause ] Now of course that includes the gorgeous campus that we're on right now. It's powered by our own solar panels and directed biogas fuel cells. But it's also about the facilities that you don't often see, like our data centers, which use lots of clean energy to support services, like iMessage. And that means every time you send an iMessage or make a Facetime video call, we're using lots of clean energy to make that happen. Now when we set out to do this, people said it couldn't be done. And if you know Apple, those are exactly the kinds of challenges that we love. So we've done it, and we're really really proud of it. And now, we're on to the next challenge. We hope to one day eliminate our need to mine new materials from the Earth. Now as you can imagine, this is a massive effort. So to reach that goal, we have to do three things. First, we'll have to find new ways to make our products with recycled or renewable materials that are sourced responsibly. Then we'll have to ensure that our products last as long as possible. And then finally after a long life of use, we have to ensure that they're recycled properly. So let's take a look at some of the material innovations within the new iPhones that we've just announced. We've transitioned to using recycled tin in the main logic board of iPhone including the new iPhone XS, and of course this is with no reduction in quality or performance. This one change will prevent the mining of over 10,000 tons of tin ore in a single year. [ Applause ] And we're doing this with other materials as well. We have a better plastics program, and through that we're reducing our use of traditional plastics and transitioning to recycled and bio-based materials. For example, the speaker enclosure for iPhone XS is now made with 35 percent post-consumer recycled plastic. And the cover glass frame is made with 32 percent bio-based plastic. It's better for the planet, but it's also tougher and it performs better. [ Applause ] Second, we also make sure to design and build durable products that last as long as possible. That means long-lasting hardware coupled with our amazing software. All of these devices, including the iPhone 5S run iOS 12 and iOS 12 is designed to make your iPhone and iPad experience even better, even more responsive, faster, just better, and because they last longer, you can keep using them, and keeping using them is the best thing for the planet. [ Applause ] And finally, when it comes time to reuse and recycle, we have Apple GiveBack. This is something I'm really proud of. With Apple GiveBack, it doesn't matter what device you have or what condition it's in, bring it in or mail it into us. We'll assess it, and if it can be used by someone else, we'll give you the value. If not, we'll recycle it properly for free. Maybe we'll even use the robot. Who remembers Liam? Well meet his sister, Daisy, who can disassemble nine different models of iPhone. Using Daisy, we can reuse those recycled materials in future products, and the more we do this, the less we'll have to mine from the Earth. So that iPhone 5S, with Apple GiveBack, it can go on to another user when you're ready to switch to a new iPhone. And when it comes to the new iPhone XS, you can feel confident that it too was designed for another long life of use. Either way, it's good for you, but it is a huge win for the planet. Thank you. [ Applause ] >> Thank you, Lisa. [ Applause ] This work is really important to all the teams at Apple, and it's a great example of the collaboration between all the teams to do everything from reducing the amount of tin in products to the GiveBack program. Just great work and we're really proud of everything they do. So, iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, they are stunning, the best iPhones we've ever made by a long shot. We are so excited about the technologies in here, the experiences they're going to bring to people, and we hope customers love them just as much as we do. We want to reach as many customers as we can with this incredible technology. So that's why we are very excited to show you one more iPhone. [ Music ] [ Applause ] It is incredible, and we are so excited to introduce you to the iPhone XR. And we hope it reaches even more customers with this amazing, incredible technology. It's made from a 7000 series aerospace grade aluminum and has more durable glass. It is absolutely stunning. It comes in incredible new finishes, white, black, blue, coral, yellow, each beautifully designed with that aluminum finish, the glass in the back. The screen goes edge to edge and top to bottom. There's even an incredible product red one as well, and it is beautiful. [ Applause ] All of these are protected from dust and liquids to IP67. They're designed end to end with the most incredible technology. This display is really what strikes you though. It's an LCD display that for the first time goes edge to edge. It took advanced new engineering and technology to do pixel masking and pixel [inaudible] and to have LEDs that fit into a smaller space than ever before. This is the most advanced LCD ever in a smartphone. [ Applause ] And it's so cool we had to give it its own cool new name, it's called the Liquid Retina display. [ Applause ] The Liquid Retina display is 6.1 inches on the diagonal. Now let's bring, well first it's 1.4 million pixels, and it's 326 pixels per inch. So true retina image quality. Now let's bring that iPhone 8 Plus next to is, because it's really interesting. It is a bigger display than the iPhone 8 Plus in a smaller design. The design actually fits perfectly between the sides of an 8 and an 8 Plus, so we think it's going to make a lot of customers really happy. [ Applause ] So a 6.1 inch Liquid Retina display, an LCD display, 1.4 million pixels. It supports tap to wake. It has that 120 Hertz touch-sensitive layer, so it scrolls super-fast. It has great color management, color accuracy. It has a wide color display, and it has true tone support. So the whites look paper white in all the lights you use them. And it is an iPhone X experience on an LCD display. So that means you tap it to wake it up. There's no home button. You swipe up to go to the home screen, a first for an LCD display. Swipe down to get your notifications. Swipe down to get to control center from the right corner. It doesn't have 3D touch, but here again the team came up with something really smart. It has a new feature we call haptic touch. So to get to the camera from the home screen, we just press on it. You feel a haptic tap, and you're taken right to the camera. This is a similar technology to what we do with the track pad in the Mac Book Pro that we all love so much. It is a great experience. And like every iPhone X new experience, it has Face ID. And there's a TrueDepth camera system, the same TrueDepth camera system in iPhone XS and XS Max. So it's an infrared camera, flood illuminator, proximity sensor, ambient light sensor, dot projector, front camera, speaker and microphone. All the technology to have an incredible Face ID experience. So you look at iPhone XR to unlock it. You look at it to pay with Apple Pay. And like iPhone XS and XS Max, it's faster but it's faster algorithms, running on a faster secure enclave. And inside the iPhone XR is nothing but the best chip we make, our brand new seven nanometer A12 Bionic chip. So this is a powerhouse, faster CPU, faster GPU, faster neural engine, and it can do all of those experiences that Kianne showed you earlier, including real-time machine learning. It is an incredible new phone. And it has a great new camera system as well. It's a single camera system, our best single camera system that we've ever made. It's a 12 megapixel, wide-angle camera, the exact same wide-angle camera in the XS and XS Max, so it's our new generation sensor that's larger with bigger pixels, optical image stabilization, twice as many focus pixels, faster f1.8 aperture, Apple designed lens, and the new improved true tone flash as well. And it takes beautiful photos. Like this one. So this was taken from an iPhone XR. It is stunning. Incredible detail, beautiful tone mapping. There's probably something you've noticed about this photo though. It's a portrait mode photo with that beautiful background blur, taken from a single camera system. This is remarkable. What the team is able to do is combine hardware and software to create a depth segmentation map using the focus pixels and neural net software so that we can create portrait mode photos on the brand-new iPhone XR. Here's another example. Just incredible, beautiful, beautiful focus on the subject, great lighting, beautiful background bokeh. Yes, it gets the same advanced bokeh technology we talked about with iPhone XS and XS Max, and it gets depth control dynamically after you've taken the picture. So all that breakthrough features and capabilities that you want are right here. Here are some other photo examples taken from iPhone XR. They are absolutely beautiful. It has Smart HDR as well. Helps to bring out highlights and shadows even in low-light photos. It has wide color as well, so you get stunning, beautiful, rich color photographs. On the front side is the same TrueDepth camera system as iPhone XS and XS Max with its latest technology so you get full support for portrait mode and portrait lighting. It can take some of the best selfies you've ever seen. These are shot off the TrueDepth camera on iPhone XR. Well what about battery life? Well here the story continues to be just great because performance in this big screen, the team has worked hard to give great battery life. So let's compare it to the iPhone 8 Plus. So many customers love the long battery life of that. Well iPhone XR gives you up an hour and a half more in your day than the iPhone 8 Plus. [ Applause ] So this is the brand new iPhone XR. It has a 6.1 inch Liquid Retina display, an LCD display, the most advanced ever in the industry. It is our latest seven nanometer A12 Bionic chip with its faster CPU and GPU and that breakthrough neural engine and helping to deliver even longer battery life. It is the best single camera system we've ever made with our new generation 12 megapixel sensor with support for Smart HDR, portrait modes with beautiful bokeh, dynamic depth control, incredible video. It has the same TrueDepth camera system as iPhone XS and XS Max with faster Face ID and on and on. These six beautiful new finishes, that incredible 7000 Series aerospace grade aluminum and IP67 protection from liquids and dust. IPhone XS, XS Max, and iPhone XR have arsenic-free display glass, mercury-free displays, BFR-free, PVC-free, beryllium-free. They're designed and manufactured with a low-carbon process, and they're highly recyclable. We're so proud of all that work the team does. This is a huge day for iPhone. We now have iPhone XS, XS Max, and XR, three new models of iPhone. We have a product video about it to tell you a little bit more, and they're amazing. [ Applause ] >> The iPhone X described our vision for the future of the smartphone. Today, we're extending that vision with significant advances across three entirely new products. iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and iPhone XR. iPhone XS is completely uncompromising. The expansive, Super Retina display with OLED delivers vivid brightness, true blacks, and high dynamic range content. iPhone XS Max has the largest display ever on an iPhone. Custom developed stainless steel is precisely machined to create structural bands in three finishes, including new gold. With even better water and dust resistance, this structure is integrated with the most durable glass ever developed for a smartphone. Face ID enabled by the TrueDepth camera system reinvents the way to securely unlock login and pay with only a glance. Now it's even faster. [ Music ] The A12 Bionic chip is the smartest and most powerful chip ever in a smartphone. It's next generation neural engine dedicates machine learning to everything from augmented reality to photography. With a more advanced dual camera system and neural engine, iPhone is again taking us to a new era of photography where even more capable sensors are combined with lenses, chips, and advanced software delivering Smart HDR across your photos, creating images like never before. Portrait mode on both the back camera and front TrueDepth camera now features more nuanced, software enhanced, adjustable depth of field. 4K video with better low-light performance, and extended dynamic range now records in stereo, and your content plays back in widened stereo sound. iPhone XR integrates the same breakthrough technologies. It's powered by the same A12 Bionic chip, has the same versatile TrueDepth camera with the same advanced Face ID. An entirely new range of finishes are enable by precision-machined, structural aluminum band, anodized to complement an all-glass enclosure. The all-screen Liquid Retina display is the most advanced LCD in a smartphone and the most color accurate in the industry. A new back light design allows the display to extend into the radius corners, enabling a larger LCD than ever before. The advanced single camera system combined with machine learning allows iPhone XR to recognize people, map subjects, and add depth. The depth of field is adjustable, so you can take more dramatic portraits. Our utterly uncompromised vision for the future, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, and with a range of new finishes offering more choice to more people, iPhone XR. [ Applause ] >> Thank you. Well iPhone XR will come in six finishes and in three sizes, 64 gigabytes, 128 gigabytes, and 256 gigabytes of storage, and it will start at $749. [ Applause ] So that's less expensive than the iPhone 8 Plus. I'm really proud of the work the team has done on that. You can order it in just over a month, October 19th, and it will start to ship a week later than that, October 26th. IPhone XS will come in three configurations, 64 gigs, 256 gigs, and that new 512-gigabyte storage capacity. It starts at $999. The iPhone XS Max, same three configurations with its larger screen, larger battery, just $100 more, starting at $1099. [ Applause ] The iPhone XS and XS Max, you can start preordering in Friday, September 14th, and it'll ship a week later, September 21st. It will start shipping in all of these markets, a nice long list. But if you don't see your favorite location there, don't worry, a week later, it'll start shipping in all of these locations as well. This is-- somebody saw their favorite country or location-- this is the fastest rollout geographically we've ever had for new iPhone. That's really great. So this holiday we have an unbelievable lineup of iPhones. iPhone 7 starts now at just $449, and there are models of iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. iPhone 8 at $599, models of 8 and Plus. The brand new iPhone XR starting at $749, XS at $999, and XS Max at $1099. They're all running iOS 12, the world's most advanced mobile operating system, and we can all upgrade to its performance and its great features, AR, Animoji, Memoji, Screen Time and more next week, September 17th. So that is our news on iPhone. Back to Tim. [ Applause ] >> Thank you, Phil. What a fantastic new lineup of iPhones. It's clearly the best lineup we've had by far, taking the breakthroughs of iPhone X even further than before and making them available to even more people. Now before we close this morning, I've got a few more updates to give you. We've got an update to the HomePod, our breakthrough home speaker. We recently added stereo pairs and AirPlay 2, so now when you add a second HomePod to create a stereo pair, it creates this incredible wide, immersive sound stage. You really have to hear this to believe it. It's really awesome. And with AirPlay 2, HomePod becomes the best multiroom audio experience. We've got some other great features that we're bringing to HomePod. You'll be able to search for your favorite songs by lyrics, create multiple timers, make and receive phone calls right from your HomePod, and just like your Apple Watch, you can ping your iPhone or any of your Apple devices to help find them around your house. It's incredibly useful at my house. And we couldn't be more excited about how Siri shortcuts will open up a world of apps for the HomePod. Also, we'll be shipping a new update to TVOS with support for Dolby At Most for Apple TV 4K. It has stunning new 4K aerials, and with access to a wide range of live sports and news programs, there are now well over 100 video partners available through the TV app. Both the HomePod and the TVOS updates will be available on Monday, September 17th. And then the following week, we've got a great new update for the Mac with MacOS Mohave, all new Dark Mode and updates to desktop and finder, enhanced privacy and security in a completely redesigned Mac App Store. MacOS Mohave will be available on September 24th. We're excited about this huge month and all of these big releases that we've got. [ Applause ] So what a great morning. We introduced the Apple Watch Series 4, newly designed and reengineered to help you stay even more active, healthy, and connected. It is the most capable Apple Watch yet. We showed you the new iPhone XS, the most advanced smartphone in the world, with a Super Retina display, advanced Face ID, a breakthrough dual camera system, and the smartest, most powerful chip ever in a smartphone. And iPhone XS is not just one phone, it's two, with the iPhone XS Max, the biggest screen ever in an iPhone, the biggest battery ever in an iPhone, and of course the biggest experience ever in an iPhone. [ Applause ] And the iPhone XR with the new Liquid Retina display, it shares so many of the advanced features of iPhone XS, and it is just stunning with six beautiful new finishes to choose from. iPhone XR will allow us to deliver the future of the smartphone to even more people. [ Applause ] At Apple, we're always pushing our products forward and making technology more personal. We hope that you love these new products as much as we do. We've got a hands-on area just upstairs that's going to open in a moment, and we hope that you'll take time to get your hands on them and experience them for yourselves. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning, including those watching us online, and I especially like to thank all the people at Apple who've made this magical day possible. Thank you.

apple watch and other apple products and services but more and more rumors suggest that this year apple could launch a number of exciting new products some actual tangible physical hardware could launch in just a few days at wwdc so what could launch this video i'm breaking down the six most exciting apple products i could launch in just a few days from now and also some bonus products i might not launch at wwdc but could launch very shortly after a lot to get excited about a lot to break down so let's get into it and a big thanks to backblaze for sponsoring this video now i don't mean to sound ungrateful but wwdc is typically not the most exciting apple event of the year we don't get a ton of new hardware typically usually it's a lot more technical focused it's geared towards developers there's more in-depth content on the software and updates coming to the ipad and iphone and stuff like that which is to be expected but sometimes we get a surprise and sometimes we don't like a look at the mac pro and the pro display xdr and sometimes it's just same old same old ios software updates but this year could be different because there is a lot of hardware that could potentially launch and a lot of big surprises that could come to this year's wwdc so let's just kind of get the obvious out of the way first things first yes we will get a look at ios 15 the big software update coming the iphone that will launch sometime this fall but interestingly enough this year there isn't a whole lot we actually know which means that apple is either doing a really good job keeping everything under wraps or there's not a lot of big changes expected to come to this next version of ios a recent report from bloomberg sort of gives us our best look at ios 15 to date and what was in that report is kind of what you'd expect to change with this next version of ios apple will kind of revamp how they do privacy safety and security i'm sure there will be a lot more in this version of ios in terms of app tracking transparency taking things a step further there should be a change to the way that notifications are handled maybe giving users a little bit more control on how notifications appear when they appear automatic replies in certain scenarios and also apple is continuing to sort of double down their efforts in terms of imessage to make that a very versatile platform for ios users exactly what they could be adding to imessage we just don't know specifics but we do know that apple wants to kind of go head-to-head with facebook messenger and whatsapp and other messaging platforms and really make imessage the messaging platform you want to use so hopefully some really good additions come to that app as well we're also hearing ipad os may give users a little bit more control and flexibility as well potentially allowing you to put widgets sort of anywhere on the display and maybe even move apps around but that's sort of it don't expect mac os to come to the ipad or anything like that uh like i said very little is known about what apple is going to change in terms of software for the devices which hopefully means there's some big surprises in store but seeing as last year i was 14 was a pretty big leap uh might be a good idea to kind of temper expectations for this year's update what will be a pretty major announcement though is what is supposedly confirmed for this year's wwdc at least according to john prosser and that is the release of brand new macbook pros now it's unclear if we're going to get one macbook pro or multiple macbook pros but here's sort of what we know as of right now apple is planning to release two new versions of the macbook pro a 14 inch model and a 16 inch model these are the higher end apple laptops that will come equipped with the new version of the m1 processor rumor has it right now it's going to be called the m1x according to bloomberg this processor should be an absolute powerhouse the macbook pro is coming equipped with a 10 core processor and options for either 16 cores or 32 cores for the gpu and the support for up to 64 gigs of ram the macbook pro should have some physical changes on the outside with an all new chassis that hopefully gets a bit of a redesign and also the reintroduction of all those ports we have long been waiting for these new macbook pros will still pack a number of thunderbolt equipped usb c ports but we'll also reintroduce a full-size hdmi port a full-size sd card slot and a magsafe charging port which it's unclear if it's gonna look like sort of the old magsafe style charging port we had on macbooks and macbook pros many years ago or if we could see sort of a redesign sort of a take like what we have on the imac whatever it's going to be i am super excited to see magsay finally return to the macbook pros and the introduction of full-size ports a sort of a new design uh the processing power the display all of this sounds really exciting and i cannot wait to see these new macbook pros finally launch now as exciting as all this is there still are some mysteries and some questions that remain about these new macbook pros first is about the display we heard that apple could give these new macbook pros a mini led display which would be super great to see but some rumors suggest this is going to happen while others suggest that there are too many technical and production limitations right now that make this sort of impossible and probably will get pushed until 2022. so it's unclear whether these new macbook pros will have mini led displays or not next john process says they are confirmed to be announced at wwc which is going to be nice to see but it's unclear when they are going to launch is apple going to make them available the next day the day of a week later three weeks later we don't know if they're sort of going to stagger the launch some rumors suggest that there could be some supply constraints for these new macbook pros when they launch so it's going to be interesting to see when these actually launch and when they get announced and when you'll actually be able to get your hands on these all new port-filled macbook pros next up let's talk about the m1 ipad pro because this is another mystery that's causing sort of some theories i don't want to say conspiracy theories but definitely some weird theories for wwdc some suggest that the m1 in the ipad pro of 2021 is so powerful so advanced so capable that it's just dumb of apple to put it in a tablet without giving us a way to really work that processor now you can work the processor pretty well with the ipad os apps that you can put on it right now but there are some theories that suggest that maybe apple could unlock some new apps at wwdc specifically apps like apple pro and apps maybe this is the event that apple finally releases final cut pro logic pro and other pro and creative apps on the ipad pro we just don't know though it does kind of make sense that the ipad pro now has keyboard support trackpad support a super powerful desktop level processor it makes sense and now is the time to sort of unlock a little bit of that power next up let's talk about something that's been causing quite a bit of controversy in the world of apple and music and that is the announcement of this new apple hi-fi lossless music streaming and the addition of spatial audio inside of apple and music now the technology itself sounds cool the feature set is awesome the fact that it's free is like the cherry on top but many are confused concerned and upset that the support for this is sort of all over the place and i'm not an audiophile so i don't really claim to understand it all fully but according to john prosser this could potentially be fixed he says with basically the magic of a software update over the air that apple could fix these issues and limitations with apple music and loss of streaming with airpods pro air pods max and regular airpods and hopefully other apple products with the introduction of this software update now the rumor is that apple could sort of introduce airplay 3 that would sort of ditch the limitations and bandwidth requirements and stuff like that of bluetooth and allow you to do way more maybe even stream lossless audio over airplay wirelessly through this third generation airplay technology this could also be great for lower latency stuff it could maybe support new versions and new additions to spatial audio it's just a really cool thing to see and it does make sense it's been a while since we got airplay 2 so airplay 3 could be potentially right around the corner and fix a lot of these issues we're also expecting to see potentially the announcement of airpods 3. they're sort of supposed to be this hybrid between airpods pro and airpods too sort of this new airpods 3 look looks very similar to airpods pro with a new shorter stem design and a new case but what we don't know is the software support as of right now transparency mode active noise cancellation spatial audio those are all reserved for airpods pro but with the introduction of airpods 3 and maybe airplay 3 could we see some of this magic sauce like spatial audio come over to these lower end airpods before we continue with more wwdc rumors i want to take a quick break and talk about something very near and dear to my heart very special and that is backing up your data look i'm sure you've been there i've been there whether you've accidentally formatted a drive or a drive has gone bad it is horrible to lose

that link down below or by going to backblaze.com next let's sort across the line between the products that are very likely to launch at wwdc to those that are sort of likely maybe they're the wild cards the one more things the products we are really hoping to see that we just don't know if they'll actually launch or not the first probably the most obvious is the beloved imac pro that we're hoping apple is going to make ever since apple took the wraps off of the colorful m1 imac at the spring loaded event there has been a lot of rumors and speculation and just a lot of hope that there is another imac in store for us it's a little bit more professional and that kind of lives up to the rumors and the concepts that looks like a pro display xdr sort of shrunken down that has a super powerful m1x or m2 processor inside that is a larger display that sort of gives us this pro end imac experience that's like the imac that we saw introduced but sort of takes that up to another level there was a lot of speculation and a lot of hopes and prayers that we could see this launch at wwc but it doesn't look likely at least the rumors don't suggest that it is uh near an imminent launch we did hear recently that apple had supposedly paused work on this larger imac to kind of dedicate resources to the launch of the 24-inch imac that we just got so at least we kind of know through this sort of backhanded confirmation that it does in fact exist but we don't know what the timeline for this is what it's going to look like what it's going to have inside we just don't know it could just be a larger version of the colorful imac we just got some other products on the horizon are a new macbook air and a new mac mini both of these come courtesy of john prosser and look absolutely amazing and according to him apple is working on some updates to these new products the macbook air would be colorful it'd have a white keyboard maybe even a white bezel around the display a collection of two usb-c ports and could be a really great addition to the lineup and again bring that splash of color from the imac and the ipad down the line to apple's laptop collection we're also hearing that apple is working on a higher end version of the macbook air but we're not sure if this is the same machine or when this could launch and also according to john prosser apple is planning a redesign of the mac mini that should be filled with all the ports you'd want like usb-c ports and hdmi ports that could potentially also get colors as well as this new design though it's very unclear when these products will launch potentially maybe sometime this year with these new m1x processors sort of this next generation or maybe sometime next year doesn't look like these are close enough at all to launching a wwdc but just something to sort of keep on your radar that apple is planning new macs new macs are coming and hopefully that we could see them launch sometime this year if not early 2022. and that is it for wwc i am really personally very excited to see ios 15 and the updates that come to the ipad and the mac and i'm crossing my fingers for some big hardware upgrades and hopefully some product announcements and uh hopefully we will see what ends up coming in just a few days from now what are you guys most excited to see do you want to get a new macbook pro are you planning to buy a new macbook pro are you holding out for that imac pro or is there a surprise one more thing that i didn't mention that you really hope apple introduces at that event curious what are you most looking forward to what do you think we'll see leave those answers in the comments down below as always thank you guys so much for watching i really appreciate it i'm robert rosenfeld and i'll see you all in

repair this is not something that is new there was an apple store employee that texted himself pictures from a customer phone and this is in a two-year-old article in the washington post and now we have another article in telegraph over here about someone not just leaking sex videos but leaking it in a manner where it seemed like the person who owned the phone intended for everybody else to see this so it wasn't even just like a here i'm just going to dump everything from this person's phone it was done in a manner where it kind of seemed like they did it on purpose which is incredibly malicious now the reason that i bring this up is because when it comes to right to repair a lot of the opposition arguments are that you don't understand if lewis gets access to a charging chip so that when the charging chip dies inside your laptop he can actually make a charge again without charging you 1500 you'd understand if you allow lewis to buy the chips that go in your computer then he's he's going to breach your privacy he's going to install tick-tock on your phone he's going to you know go through your stuff and breach your data and hack you and you may think that these arguments are ridiculous you may think that this is insane this is fear uncertainty and doubt but the reality is that these arguments work and the reason i know they work is because i just finished up a focus group recently for them actually and that was one of the arguments that seemed to resonate a lot with voters the data privacy argument a lot of people thought the anti-right to repair argument was made stronger by the argument for data privacy and the independents are going to hack into your stuff and like it makes me sad that that's the case but that's the reality now one of the things that i've always said on this channel i've always pushed back against this i don't accept the premise of it because i don't believe just like they used to say that there's going to be this magic soviet man that's not motivated by the incentive structures that are inherent in the rest of human society that there's this the authorized man and the authorized man can never be a creep you understand even when you're hiring tens of thousands of hundreds of thousands of millions of people your no authorized man will ever be a creep that's just never gonna happen you're never gonna have a creep that you're not able to detect during your normal interview process because the authorized man well he's just a different type of human once they start working at the authorized facility they just modify your dna and remove the creepy from you i've always thought that this is absolutely ridiculous and the reality is that we have creeps out there in the world and just like there's a likelihood that i could miss something and hire someone who's a creep apple can and soak in their contractors so let's get on to this so a few years ago again this is the article where an apple store employee texted themselves photos from a phone and here it says apple pays millions to a woman after explicit photos were posted online technicians posted the private photos and video from her iphone after she sent it to apple for repair according to legal documents apple paid millions of dollars to a student after iphone repair technicians posted explicit photos and videos from her phone facebook legal documents have revealed the tech giant agreed to a settlement with the 21 year old after two employees at a repair facility uploaded the images from a phone she had sent to apple to be fixed resulting in severe emotional distress the incident which occurred in 2016 at a center in california run by pegatron an apple contractor is one of the most significant privacy violations to be revealed at an iphone repair facility so let's just get this straight so the most significant privacy violation to be repealed at pretty much any iphone repair facility happened at an apple contractor that was authorized and certified by apple to work on customer products let that sink in that should be the headline of many many other articles that get shared everywhere and we're not the ones that opens this pandora's box independent repair technicians were not the ones saying you need to come to us don't go to apple they'll steal your data we never tried to use fear uncertainty and doubt to get people to use us over the manufacturer we simply offered our services we gave our price and our turnaround time and we allow the customer to decide from there apple has often argued that its control over how its devices can be fixed helps to protect customers privacy lobbying against legislation that would make it easier for third parties to fix its electronics legal filings show that the unnamed victim a university student in oregon sent her phone apple after it stopped working while it was being fixed the two technicians posted 10 photos of her in various stages of undress and a sex video from her facebook account in a way that suggests that she uploaded them herself let's go over that so not only did they leak her data they leaked her data in a manner where it just kind of seemed like it was done on purpose so it wasn't here go you know download this torrent and you can check out everything on louis's hard drive it would be like if somebody had actually hacked into my youtube account and uploaded a sex video on my drive to my channel so it looked like i intended for you to see it so that's another step of malicious that needs to be understood here so it's not just creepy but it's creepy and more malicious than it needs to be which is really going far given the situation the images were only removed after friends informed her they had been posted the exact size of the settlement was not disclosed but was described in filings as a multi-million dollar sum and that lawyers for the individuals had demanded five million dollars in negotiation lawyers for the victim had threatened to sue for invasion of privacy and infliction of emotional distress and had warned of the negative media publicity that would accompany a lawsuit the settlement included a confidentiality provision that prevented her from discussing the case or revealing the size of the payout the incident emerged during a legal dispute between pegatron which had reimbursed apple for the settlement and its insurers which in turn refused to foot the bill again insurance never fits the bill for footstool for anything so that shouldn't be surprising so it looks like pegatron screwed up the woman sued apple apple paid the woman apple then turned around at pegatron and said okay you all got to pay us because you screwed up and then pegatron went to their i don't know maybe they had screw-up insurance or something and their screw-up insurance decided not to pay apple was only recently named the customer during a separate unrelated lawsuit against the iphone maker and the company confirmed the incident to the telegraph so it looks like here apple may have sued their contractor over this their breach happened at a pikatron facility in a suburb of the california city of sacramento where apple has a substantial presence and legal filings apple had argued that making details of the settlement public could irreparably harm it and cause substantial business harm of course it would because apple has based their entire business model when it comes to repair on the idea that your data is safe with them and unsafe with us they're the ones through their lobbying that made data privacy and security when you go to one of those vagabond rosman groups or ipad rehabs an issue so yeah obviously it would hurt them really badly because to my knowledge jessa and i have not had anybody you know from our store just go through customers data and upload it willy-nilly yet this has happened not once but twice with apple the incident triggered an exhaustive investigation by apple according to the filings with the two individuals responsible for posting the images fired the case was dismissed after pegatron and the insurers settled privately apple as well as trade groups representing the company have argued against right to repair laws that campaigners say would make it easier for independent technicians to fix devices claiming that this would jeopardize safety or privacy the company told the us committee in 2019 that its oversight of iphone repairs ensures a safe and reliable repair an apple spokesman said we take the privacy and security of our customers data extremely seriously and have a number of protocols in place to ensure data is protected throughout the repair process when we learned of this egregious violation of our policies at one of our vendors in 2016 we took immediate action and have since continued to strengthen our vendor protocols now at the end of the day do i think that people should not go to apple because going to apple for repairs is unsafe when it comes to their data of course not they have tens of thousands of hundreds of thousands of employees at these facilities and at some point in time they will hire the wrong person that does some creepy manipulative ship that that's just the way it is i wouldn't say that independent repair is unsafe just because one employee had a you break ifix or one employee at some crappy franchise decided to go through a customer's data and upload it because bad things happen on an isolated basis does not mean that we need to just throw out the entire practice altogether because there was this one isolated incident that being said it's about time that we stop with the fear uncertainty and doubt stop with these arguments being used because at this point this isn't one data breach this is two data breaches and they were both of embarrassing personal stuff again we're not talking about they took your credit card number and they bought gas with it we're talking about the uploaded sex videos to social media and texted themselves pictures raunchy sexual pictures from someone's cell phone that's disgusting and this did not happen at rosman repair this did not happen at you know joe's repair down the street this happened when they sent the device to apple there is no such thing as the authorized man the authorized soviet man that is just above all other types of men when someone goes to work at apple they don't remove the creep part from your dna that's not the way any of this works they are hiring from the same pool of flawed crazy screwed up individuals as the rest of us and when you're hiring hundreds of thousands of people at some point when you're hiring hundreds of thousands of people one of them's gonna be a creep and they're gonna do stupid [ __ ] this is not the first time this has happened this is the second and it's not the last there'll be a third a fourth and a fifth and there will be times when independent repair shops likely sadly i hate to say it do the same thing because you cannot remove all elements of of degeneracy from a society overnight it's just not going to happen you can't stop car crashes from happening you can't stop people from getting sick and dying you can you can't stop any of this stuff i mean you could try to prevent it you can do things to try and stop it from happening and we can put in place practices and procedures and do everything we can to disincentivize this from occurring but it's never going to stop there's always going to be someone out there who's screwed in the head who does something like this and what i think we really need to get out there to people is that when you go to the dealer okay they may use different parts they may have a different repair procedure but at the end of the day they're no better at filtering out creeps than any of us and i think it's really important that stuff like this show up in the news and i think it should show up more prominently in the news because the strongest argument against right to repair when we put the opposition arguments and the for right to repair arguments in front of all different demographics of people tech savvy untech savvy you know upper class lower class old young the privacy argument hit almost every group the data privacy and hacking and all of that that if you go to the independent they're going to screw around and get your data but that's not going to happen at the manufacturer and that's just demonstrably with evidence at this point not true not trying to like bash on apple here because as i'm saying this is eventually going to happen to an independent repair center it will happen people are sick bastards and at some point some repair center out there is going to hire a sick bastard and but to pretend that it only happens at independence and doesn't happen at apple that's something that they're doing and since they're the ones that made this these statements they're the ones that are putting data privacy and security on the table as a reason to not have right to repair i think it's really important that we keep pointing out that they're so far the only ones that have had an issue like this not us i haven't seen an independent repair shop make the front page of telegraph of the washington post because they uploaded sex videos of their clients that's it for today and as always i hope you learned something and if you have an idea in the comments on how we can get this kind of message across to more people because this was the point in every focus group that really seemed to hit every group even legislators do let us know you know really we need to get the word out to people that this data privacy and security argument is just complete made up bunk and that if we have access to a charging chip or a screen or anything like that that that's not going to make us any more likely to upload sex videos from customer phones see you on the next one bye now the next apple event could be coming soon with some very big surprises wwdc has now come and gone and although we're expecting to see the iphone 13 launch this fall what could happen between then and now we know apple is working on a lot of very exciting products that we could see sooner than later in this video i'm breaking down the seven most exciting apple products set to launch sometime this year in 2021 and some of these could launch as soon as maybe just a couple of weeks from now and a huge thanks to squarespace for sponsoring this video squarespace is your one-stop destination for creating a beautiful looking website for your blog portfolio business and much much more stay tuned to learn more unfortunately apple has not held an august event in many many years if they've ever even held one at all and as much as i wish this year would change all that i don't think it's gonna happen but that doesn't mean there couldn't be a flurry of press releases and announcements of many exciting new apple products that could be launching very soon we know apple is hard at work on many different projects and it seems like they've got a lot to announce and release before the end of this year according to the rumor mill apple is supposedly showing the mac line a lot of love instead of cooper tuna these days and according to multiple rumors and sources and people like john prosser there is a lot going on inside of cupertino right now to build up the mac line to make it bigger and better than ever before now when apple first debuted that new imac at the spring loaded event a few weeks ago it was kind of hard to look at that white bezel around the imac you either loved it or you hated it and i'm still sort of coming around to the idea the more i see it in person and in real life photos the more it's sort of growing on me which i guess is kind of a good thing because it looks like it's kind of here to stay john prosser gave us our first real look at the next generation macbook air which could be launching sometime soon and it looks like apple's thinnest and lightest laptop is going to get quite the makeover rip macbook doesn't look like that's coming back but long live the macbook air because apple is supposed to be giving this laptop a lot of attention first things first it looks like colors are making their way from the iphone and the ipad and the imac down to the macbook air as the macbook air could come in multiple colors gone is sort of the tapered design we've seen on the macbook air for over a decade and in is now the new uniform sort of boxy design we had on the iphone and this more industrial design language we've seen on other apple products it's like ssc on the macbook air and this looks like a very beautiful laptop we also might be getting a white keyboard and possibly white bezels around the display again which is either one of those things you'll love or hate but hopefully it starts to grow on more and more of us especially if apple kind of makes this a theme in their different laptops like the macbook air and maybe even potentially a lower end macbook pro the keyboard should not feature full-size function keys which is super nice to see and also that's going to mean that the trackpad is going to get a little bit smaller on the macbook air though it still is pretty giant relatively compared to other windows laptops and is still plenty spacious and plenty usable now according to bloomberg apple is working on a higher end macbook air that would have the successor to the m1 processor but this is not like a next generation m processor but it's the same core count the same eight cores as the current m1 but they're going to be running faster so this is sort of a chip targeted at the higher tier of lower end apple devices but it seems like a lot of the components for this seem to be done especially if they're basically going with a touched up version uh tuned up version of the m1 so maybe we could see this new macbook air launch sooner than later maybe even before the end of the year in 2021 and of course we are still waiting for the 14 inch and 16 inch macbook pro the big redesign we did not get that obviously at wwdc but hopefully that is the next new mac that gets released next up let's talk about another apple product that hasn't really gotten a whole lot of love lately and one that i think many people have kind of forgotten about and that is the iphone se now yes this device just did get a refresh back in 2020 and it's still really good in 2021 but there are many rumors on what this next generation iphone ic could do and more importantly what it could look like now there are a lot of rumors and a lot of speculation on what this next gen iphone sc could look like and they sort of go down two diverging paths some believe the iphone sc is going to receive yet another small incremental upgrade it's probably going to look the same kind of the same casing as the iphone 8 it'll probably get 5g support maybe a new processor inside maybe some camera improvements but not a whole lot of changes coming to the iphone i see while other rumors suggest there are much bigger changes in store for this new lower cost iphone perhaps adapting the design language of the iphone 11 but instead of having a notch maybe having a hole punch notch at the top of the display maybe touch id built on the power button maybe face id in that hole punch notch and maybe two cameras on the back as well like i said lots of rumors here lots of speculation we don't exactly know what is going to happen with this device and although we heard from some sources that we couldn't see a new iphone se launched this year in 2021 doesn't look like that's going to happen many analysts predict that we won't see a change to the iphone i see until next year and the change we see will probably be smaller so in 2022 we'll get a smaller upgrade to the iphone sc and then possibly the next year in 2023 that's when we'd see the hole punch notch on the iphone i see a bigger design change all that stuff coming to the lower end iphone so some good news some bad news new iphone i see is coming maybe by the end of this year but probably not alongside a new macbook air we're also hearing apple is working on a new mac mini but this one would be sort of updated a bit geared towards pro end users but would still feature a colorful design as well according to john prosser this mac mini could be filled with ports galore with usba ports usbc thunderbolt ports a magnetic power cable and even a full-size hdmi port as well unfortunately no sd card slot here but you still have plenty of other ports to work with now an interesting note here because this mac mini is supposedly geared towards these pro high-end users bloomberg says that this device will have the same processor that's going inside the all-new macbook pros again unfortunately no concrete timeline on when we could see this mac mini but because this has the same chip as the new macbook pros that means apple really just has to iron out sort of the details on the cosmetics and the changes to the chassis and stuff like that so maybe we could see this launch soon as well possibly before the end of the year it'd be super great to see and i am all in on a pro end pro focused small little mac mini another all new product expected to launch this fall is an all new ipad mini but i'm sorry to say it's not gonna look like this but it's probably gonna look more like this actually no old robert you're wrong things have actually changed and there is some good news to discuss about the all-new ipad mini and according to mark german over at bloomberg there is a refresh mini supposedly in the works that could launch this year in 2021. now details are a little sparse what we're hearing that apple is at least testing a model with no home button and thinner bezels now could we get sort of this ipad pro esque design in a smaller form factor like these renders that looks absolutely amazing with face id built in and the latest and greatest apple silicon inside or could apple do sort of more an ipad air ask design approach where we get colors still a really nice display though it doesn't have promotion maybe touch id built into the power button there are a couple different ways that apple could go with this but i think that everyone would be happy to see some kind of upgrade to come to the ipad mini whether it's an ipad pro mini or an ipad air mini before we continue chances are you guys know that i'm a big fan of apple but another company i am a huge fan of and that is very near and dear to my heart is this video sponsor squarespace when i sat down to build my first website i was looking for a platform that offered a few really important things first

and i know you guys will too learn more today at the link down below or by going to squarespace.com the apple circle and rounding out the list of new macs according to bloomberg apple is working on a new higher end mac pro with apple silicon inside and also an all-new imac now by all accounts this mac pro sounds like an absolute beast and should just be an absolute powerhouse that should be able to shred through just about anything though we probably won't see that until next year because that'll probably be at the end of apple's silicon transition the imac on the other hand uh in our heads and in our dream sounds promising but we just don't have a lot of details what we're hoping is that apple sort of adopts a pro display xdr design language for this higher end imac call it an imac pro that has super slim bezels it's got a powerful m processor inside a super high resolution display maybe it's 30 inches 32 inches i could go on and on and on and what we'd like to see though we just don't know specifics according to bloomberg apple is working on this higher end imac or at least this larger imac though uh development was paused a bit to make sure the 24 inch could be finished in time and we just don't know what this could be hopefully it's an imac pro though it just could be sort of a larger displayed imac like we got just a few weeks ago so we just really don't know specifics but we know one is coming soon possibly we can see this one before the end of the year as well and finally the last wild card here is the apple mixed reality headset which won't launch until 2022 according to rumors but we could see a sneak peek of that sometime this year we did hear rumors that apple was supposed to give us sort of a sneak peek at this new device this sort of oculus quest like mixed reality headset that it was loaded with cameras and sensors and would show you the real world in an augmented world in a virtual world it's sort of hard to pinpoint exactly what this device could do and who it was geared for but we know apple has been working on this for a while and this device would sort of be the precursor for apple glass coming in a few years it seems very exciting we know apple obviously cares a lot about augmented reality and virtual reality as well and this could be a very exciting device now there's really no clear indication on when we could see this maybe it's the one more thing we get a sort of a sneak peek of at the fall event with the iphone 13 maybe it's a separate event maybe it's just a press release we don't know specifics so again keep an eye out for this one because we should learn more before the year is up and that's it guys those are seven products we are expecting to see launched or at least get a good sneak peek of before the end of the year in 2021 obviously a lot of new macs some new iphones possibly a new ipad there is lots to get excited about of course with the iphone 13 coming very soon as well what are you guys looking uh forward to most are you ready for that ar mixed reality headset do you want that all new ipad mini or is there another product that wasn't featured that you really want to know more about and you cannot wait to buy let me know your thoughts in the comments down below as always thank you guys so much for watching i'm robert rosenfeld from the apple circle thank you very much and i'll see you all in the next one [Music] [Music] you [Music] what's going on brian tong here and welcome to the apple bits for everything good and bad inside the world of apple and where are you at after the wwdc 21 keynote we've had some time to digest this are you good are you bad are you happy maybe a little sad because i think that that's a little bit of all of us right now a combination of those feelings and look i know so many of you fell let down because there were no macbook pros the rumor mills and leakers they set our expectations like really high and yes i was part of that but i do make it very clear in all my videos that we might see it i don't use any of these words like confirmed or official and surprise the only one who really knows knows is apple so hey maybe we'll see a follow-up announcement in the next month but even if you feel disappointed just like shake that all off okay like like like shake it all off just because your expectations were not met that were based on non-official rumors so what we're going to do here is we're going to evaluate wwdc21 for what they did bring us and then how significant some of these changes are for apple users and it always does come down to the user obviously some features that matter to me won't matter to you and some that matter to you won't matter to me so i'm gonna cover a lot of stuff here i can't cover everything but we're gonna get to the big stuff now take a moment think about this if you rated this wwdc for yourself from a scale of one to ten what would you give it right now you know i've taken some time to think about this i'm now kind of leaning more like five or six maybe six i guess look i'm calling it a six and this is not because there were no macbook pros like during the keynote i was jokingly tweeting that during the first half hour of it that i wasn't watching wwdc but more like aadc as in the apple android developer conference because ios 15 just brought a whole lot of features that we've seen in android to apple users for the very first time now there were a lot of good things at the keynote but i have to start with the biggest letdown for me you think you know what it is because apple they did nothing to show us that they remotely care about unlocking the power of the m1 ipad pro you know i've loved the ipad pro from day one i'm a day one or you know this already and in my review of the current m1 ipad pro my reviews just said hey uh the upgrades are great you get the m1 the mini led screen the thunderbolt port the 16 gigs of ram on a one terabyte or higher configuration but they are higher end features really geared towards digital artists content creators and professionals you know i kept throwing around the phrase apple made the ipad pro more pro for pros so the hope was that hey we would get features that would finally take advantage of the power of the m1 and the ipad pro none of that happened like nothing you know we got widgets on every page that was a feature that honestly should have been there on day one with the iphone last year we got some larger ones but this is a refinement they added the app library for organization again a feature that is really a carryover that should have been there with ios 14. you know they talk about the ipad being its own thing but this year it brought more ios to the table than anything else multitasking has been redone to make it easier you can tap on the top instead of always kind of fiddling around and dragging from the bottom in a clumsy way that even i would screw up it is refined but your brain will still have to learn some new gestures to manage this and then there's the shelf that manages all windows that are open for a specific app look i'd rather see all the different split screen setups or workspaces i've made similar to maybe what's on a mac and this whole thing is a refinement but again you can do this on any ipad from i guess at least the past three or four years you know they showed off quick note but i don't have an apple pencil in my hand at all times also holding an ipad in the air with one hand and then writing on it with the other that is not easy to do people try it so my man will has some freakish super hand strength right here and i'm not a developer but i'd love to hear what developers out there think about bringing swift playground to the ipad to build apps on a tablet you also got to throw translation in there another ios feature but that's what we got for ipad os 15. even this slide you know that they show at the end sometimes brings to light other nuggets but no there is nothing here related to the pro you look back and the first ipad pro came out in 2015 and we're still waiting for apple to create some semblance of a professional workflow with their signature pro apps six years later yo like i'm not hoping that they do the ipad pro right anymore this is a product i've loved and continued to want more from because it can do so much more they pack these amazing specs in it in 2021 but they're treating it just like every other ipad and until they take the ipad pro seriously with features that match its price point that are also worthy of its name that's a bad apple it's like apple really cause oh like this is what it feels like you did to me and my love for the ipad pro and to be fair ipad os did get better it didn't do anything groundbreaking but still it's completely ignoring the fact that it has the same power as a fully loaded macbook pro 13-inch and it's a damn shame but i'm honestly still getting over this thing of it it's like when someone you love breaks your heart a little and you know you just have to deal with it and it's not like you're leaving or going anywhere but it still hurts and i don't want to hurt anymore okay okay let's jump around the keynote and talk about arguably the highlight of wwdc21 that i might not even use but i hope i do because it looks so badass universal control and mac os monterey it sounds so classy and this is straight up some sorcery or magic where devices on the same icloud account whether it's a mac or ipad can auto detect each other when they put them down side by side you need to start from the mac but you can move the cursor over and use the ipad with the keyboard and mouse you're still using to control an ipad now this is different from sidecar which is used as a second display or to mirror each other with universal control you can actually use the gestures to control the ipad like you would if it had a magic keyboard connected to it but you're using the max keyboard and mouse or trackpad now you're also able to take assets from one device to another as if they're connected i mean this is bonkers and that's a rad apple yeah also if you're rich and you like showing off if you have what over 6 000 plus dollars of hardware you can use three devices for universal control and drag and drop content from one side all the way to the other now i don't know how often i'm gonna use this in my personal workflow and maybe i won't but it's still the coolest thing that i saw in the entire wwdc keynote you know more of those things okay in mac os monterey safari gets a facelift i love the more minimalistic look the ability for the page color to integrate into the whole web browser tab group's a cleaner implementation of kind of like bookmarks folders and we're gonna have to see what extensions it supports or doesn't but i'm liking this cleaner safari along with its power efficiency hey maybe it's time for me to make it my primary browser on the mac over chrome or should have i done that like a long time ago i don't know i i would say some solid things happen in monterey but let's jump over to ios 15 where the kino started in a lot of these features are also on the other os because really the iphone and ios is the center of the apple universe even mac os is more like ios than it's ever been before so let's hit on some of these big features and themes i use facetime a bunch so i love bringing spatial audio to the app and we'll see how good voice isolation is they had that leaf blower in the background or even using wide spectrum all this looks pretty cool and sounds promising and if you leave right now like i totally understand but there's also a new grid view and if you want to look fancy there's portrait mode for facetime these are all small tweaks but combined they make the facetime that i use all the time even better we also have apple they're they're trying to take a slice out of the zoom and web conferencing pi by sending a facetime link to schedule a meeting time people on android and windows can join in from a web browser and was apple just trolling by making it look so bad on those phones but then this got me thinking because messages for android was rumored it didn't happen but why not develop an app with messages and facetime built in so android users don't have to use a web browser to join the conference and i'm not saying that it's going to happen but apple music is on android already so that's not too far of a stretch and let's be real some of you just want to fix for that one friend in your group chat who makes the group chat use green bubbles instead of blue messages on android would fix that too but it'd also be a way to possibly lure even more people over who get comfortable with that taste of the ecosystem like justin bieber once told me never say never never say never in fact here here's the photo that he he actually signed for me when i met him at ces so it actually says like he signed it to say brian and then it it's jb there never say never all right their new one here share play this would have been a huge hit if it was released during the pandemic it's still gonna be useful but not as useful as it could have been six months ago you can listen to music and share it watch videos or even share your screen together my mama just got real happy because now there's an even easier way for me to troubleshoot her computer for her at any time thanks share play i don't get why they focused on showing people using share play over video while holding their phones up i'm not gonna watch a show or a movie holding my phone up the entire time and look i work out like they should have shown it on an ipad where it makes more sense but i get it their top selling product is an iphone by the time it comes out in the fall though we will hopefully be clear of this pandemic and if we are this is great for long distance relationships but i don't see myself using it that much now they're opening up the share play api to third-party apps like disney plus hulu and hbo max and we'll see how elegant it can be with them because on a desktop uh like two windows staggered like this for share play no that is not the answer for me either so i'm pretty lukewarm on this feature now messages get the ability to share more content and access it more easily between people you care about nothing game changing here for me it's also funny how apple is one of the biggest companies responsible for us being so connected to our phones and now with their new focus feature they want us to find more balance between work and life because there's a lot of people that have a problem with just putting their devices down and being in the moment like you'll have different profiles for what activity or state of mind you're in and then you can get notifications delivered to make sense to those different profiles if you're on personal time it can be limited to friends and family or your work profile allows notifications from all work apps you can set it on one device and it applies to all your devices it's an attempt to prevent us from being distracted from the very device apple put in our hands oh wait hold on i just got a notification here there's still no calculator app on the ipad what kind of sick world is this now the coolest most useful feature in ios 15 for me live text and yes google lens has had this it's not original but it's new for apple users take a picture or a screenshot and wherever you see text you can copy paste it or interact with it look up a business or click on a link all this happens on device as long as you're running mac os monterey ios 15 or ipad os 15 if you have a picture on it even old ones the neural engine does all the work for you and gives you live text if you or someone else is running an older operating system you won't be able to take advantage of this feature it understands seven languages on launch it works on objects and locations or books and art like i said this is google lens but apple's version of it and i'm not even mad it's not original but i'm happy it's on ios and i know i'm going to be using this a whole lot apple wallet gets better and can unlock your house or apartment with home key if it's a compatible lock they're adding corporate badges and over 1 000 hyatt hotel properties that can be used as a hotel key but it's biggest move bringing id cards to apple wallet so you can scan your driver's license and then it puts it right into apple wallet like magic the tsa is also on board as one of the first places that you'll be able to use your digital id and i know it might take time for your state to get up to speed but i'm taking my wallet out with me less and less these days and i love this i hope everyone starts kind of getting used to this idea because that's a good apple and i've also been saying this for a while let's let go of everything you thought of apple maps being a total disaster from years ago apple's invested in this app and in the past where i would have had done honestly everything to avoid it i enjoy using it i use it it hasn't done me wrong over at least the past two or three years and i've preferred it over google maps at times now it's not available everywhere that's one of its drawbacks but if you're in a country that supports it or will support it by the end of this year this is a legit product and it's getting better we got their maps they're even more detailed with customized looking landmarks you got elevation it has much more of a polished look to them really it's become an apple fied maps even nighttime mode with cool looks for iconic spots i mean that looks sweet now using the maps while driving there's more road details like crosswalks and it renders overlapping interchanges in 3d trust me you're going to need that if you're visiting la you can also scan the buildings around you to get your bearings in maps if you're in one of the cities that's getting this feature by the end of the year unfortunately laredo texas was left off this list but why did i spend time on maps it's because i like it i like it a lot so that's what we got in ios 15 a lot of nice improvements and features facetime stepped up its game live text real ids in apple wallet and maps i thought it was a pretty solid offering with things that i liked but there's also a lot of things i will never use or didn't even mention and you know that's okay too now airpods get some improvements hold on let me correct that in reality it's the airpods pro and airpods max conversation boost for people with hearing challenges focuses in on the person you're talking to but it only works with airpods pro you can use airpods max and airpods pro to send out a bluetooth signal to the find my network in ios 15. you can also get a separation alert from them if you leave them behind and if you have any standard air pods none of these features are coming to you but the big one what we have all wanted from the beginning spatial audio is finally coming to airpods max and airpods pro when you're watching content on apple tv and on macs i love this but these are features you know i'll actually use that make what i have even better and again i'll actually use them unless uh you have regular airpods dolby atmos for apple music is already starting to roll out and it's a lot like 360 reality audio from sony not everyone has had much experience with it but to hear this sound and for it to really come alive it's really all about the mix and making this you know music and sounds and voices feel like it's from different areas in your listening space you got different genres of music that can help this music format sound better than others but it also can be hit or miss now if you have airpods max or airpods pro everything you heard here is a good apple and if you just have regular airpods you're a sad apple now let's go to one of my other favorite devices here the apple watch and watch os 8. it can be hard to get the whole picture because new hardware typically comes in the fall for apple watch that unlocks new features especially here a new mindfulness app has the breathe exercise that gets a new animation the reflect exercise also has a new animation that you aren't supposed to be looking at when you're reflecting the sleep app now measures respiratory rate it's always good to get another metric but again it doesn't appear to lead to any actionable recommendations or deeper sleep metrics that other apps still have and do better there's new pilates workouts and tai chi in watchos 8. the music artist spotlight series for workouts is taking exactly what peloton has been doing for a while and copying it i'm not sure why they spent the longest amount of time on photos for apple watch i don't know about you i never look at photos on this little tiny screen like it is teeny tiny almost everyone is using their phones first because of the bigger screen and guess what most people have their apple watch connected directly to their phone unless they are setting up the apple watch to be independent from the iphone the number one thing that i've asked for them to do you know they spend more time on messages and i just use voice dictation because it's too tedious to like hand scribble every character and then correct mistakes i also will not be searching gifs on that small tiny screen so maybe apple watch is gonna be eventually free from the iphone if they're trying to push people to use it independently like this i just think it's clumsy and not as easy to use if you have this right next to you now two features i would use the most came on the final slide multiple timers on the apple watch i believe that would be a first anywhere on any apple device correct me if i'm wrong but is multiple timers really limited to just the apple watch apple really it also looks like you can find items from the find my app directly on the apple watch and that's going to become real useful once in a while so the two features that make the biggest difference for me weren't even in the presentation they were on the slide all right we head to the home and the new home key to use your phone or watch is nice we talked about it nothing groundbreaking but it does again kind of keep you in this ecosystem doing all these things in different ways specifically on apple devices i already told you i'm not too hot on share play with your iphone for watching shows or movies but the for all of you feature that recommends content based on all of your family members preferences it does sound good in theory we're gonna have to see how it plays out but is it only limited to apple tv plus content or is it gonna extend to all services but then they did this now when you're ready to watch something you want to sound amazing so this fall you can select homepod mini as the speakers for your apple tv 4k i'm sorry but the homepod minis sound anything but amazing they're good for their size but individually they are not amazing and two paired together they aren't either come on every single person at cupertino knows this too that's a great gray apple [Laughter] man the apple juice must be that good like you actually had an amazing speaker that you discontinued it's called the home pod all right the biggest news siri will be coming built in on third-party devices this is a huge step if it means more devices beyond the roughly 600 plus that they have right now will finally be compatible with apple's homekit platform and that just piggybacks perfectly on their smart home platform matter that is going to be the official name of that smart home alliance made up of google amazon apple pretty much every other major smart home vendor covering tens of thousands of devices the apple smart home finally just got a whole lot better and that's a good apple yeah all right there is so much in here there is so much that i didn't talk about but after breaking down some of this how would you rate the keynote after i guess you maybe cool down some i want to know put in the comments tell me your rating for the event and then there's things i didn't talk about maybe there's things that you liked i didn't talk about maybe there's features you really didn't like that i didn't talk about maybe there's stuff you really didn't like that i did talk about put it all in there let it go this is like a cathartic process but uh whew that was a long one but even with all the things apple did the disappointment to me the biggest one the biggest letdown the m1 ipad pro is is still like hanging over me so that's why i still give this i'm like middling five or six it wasn't horrible it wasn't great it wasn't the best we've seen but uh that m1 ipad pro situation with ipad os that that that was like that was a punch to the gut i hated that so all right that's gonna do it for this video if you like what you see give me that thumbs up subs up and hit that notification bell ding to get all my videos when they drop and if you want more of that apple goodness you can check out my apple bits xl audio podcast to get the latest deep dive with all these stories and new ones every week with special guests thank you so much for watching i'll see you soon you know that i got plenty more videos coming so we'll talk to soon take care and be safe [Music] peace [Music] hello hi craig how are you i'm all right very nice to meet you yeah me too my pleasure to uh can speak to you in distance i'm in paris you are in cupertino at apple park i i yes i am indeed yeah so um wwc was on monday he was brought on stage like every year did you have a chance to to watch it yeah of course yeah what did you think pretty cool lots of announcements yeah yeah yeah no it's it's uh it's a fun thing to put together but uh it's become quite a quite a production using apple park in all these different ways for for the show it's a magical place it definitely is so i've got a question for you about macos monterrey yeah and even on one features called universal control it blew my mind when you present these features to the world and um this feature allows to for example put an imac on the desk and on the right we can put an ipad and on the other side we can put for example a macbook pro so we can be able to make some drag and drops between ipads and other macs yeah how does it works and is there any um limits to these new features or not well we haven't we haven't found the limit yet um yeah it's you know we've been building these these continuity technologies for really over a decade now with things like airdrop and actually a lot of those foundations are what support universal control you know we've been building these capabilities for your devices to become aware of each other using um typically bluetooth le bluetooth low energy technology where if you're signed into icloud your devices can uh privately be aware of each other and know that it's another one of your devices so it knows it's kind of in the same room and and we also have these other things like uh peer-to-peer wi-fi that can enable high-speed connectivity and that's the kind of thing that's used when you actually airdrop a file so we were able to bring these couple of foundational things together and say that well if if your mac and your ipad or multiple of them are aware of each other and know that they're they're on then the the real trick was to figure out how do we know that you're intending to use them in this way and we really wanted to say like you shouldn't have to set it up you shouldn't have to go into preferences and arrange anything um and you know we considered all kinds of crazy advanced ideas with exotic technologies to figure out like where's the ipad where's the mac how do we know but you know it occurs to us that if you're as the user you know where the ipad is when you're trying to go to it and that's where you're going to move the mouse and so we were able to say well if you start moving the mouse against the edge of your mac screen and you really seem determined to do it we bet the ipad's over there and so the eye then we can talk over bluetooth um and tablet and then use that to bootstrap this this uh peer-to-peer wi-fi connection and the ipad can say oh great i think we're doing it and can start to show you know that it recognizes what's happening and then as you pull through now we have a full link between the two sending all of the commands from your trackpad or mouse uh and then you break through and we say great they're paired and you know you go the other way and we figure oh the other device is over there and so it's uh it's such a simple solution but in a way ends up with an experience that's so intuitive because you know we think features like this if if you can just use them in the most natural way then you're you're actually going to do it and if you have to go do a big setup and so forth you know sometimes if that's too much trouble i'm going to just do something else and so i think we were really thrilled to be able to put this you know kind of zero setup thing building on all these technologies and then and then enable stuff that's uh you know that we all want to do every day like sometimes you just worked on something over here you want to get it over there you know why should you have to figure out how to email it to yourself or save it to a cloud drive or something just move it on over in exactly the way you're kind of thinking about in your mind and so it's uh it was a fun one to put together and certainly a fun one to demonstrate yeah yeah i hope to to test that to to experience that soon so yeah it's kind of pretty cool a new update for for the mac and for ipad s15 too yeah yeah for sure and and i do think so many of our customers so many of our best customers you know they start with one device but eventually they do uh end up wanting another and another and they fill different roles in their lives but i think where a lot of the magic can come in is when they can put them together in these different ways and so i think universal control is just uh i don't know if it's the pinnacle but it's one of one of those uh i think kind of really magical things that i think that people i hope are really going to enjoy yeah perfect thank you this was the perfect answer you can make for me uh but i've got an last question if i can ask to you uh now for this facetime i'm using my m1 imac it's a gold one for a yellow one but in some cases with lightning i see gold on my imac and i see this beautiful can ask you what is your favorite color of imac m1 yeah well it's probably no surprise to anyone who sees the the shirts i i wear for you know every one of our events but but the blue one i i love that color blue and the imac it's great yeah yeah it's a good one i like it too yeah maybe i may not be uh too far too far out there i agree the the uh the gold one is uh is pretty special it's very sunny but uh but i do i do love the blue yeah with the summer it's the perfect match i think our customers should get at least one imac for every season so yes for summer get the yellow one could be great so thank you very much craig for your time wonderful to meet you yeah thank you very much and i hope one day we can make together in real life because i've got plenty of questions to ask to you and i think you are the good person a good guy to ask all of my questions thank you craig have a good day bye bye bye bye is [Music] bye - We're... concerned.
