japan says north korea has fired two ballistic missiles they were launched from south hamgyong province into the sea near japan the u.s pacific command has responded saying the launches show that pyongyang is a threat to its neighbors rob mcbride joins us live now from the south korean capital seoul rob so yet another missile launch from north korea what more do we know at this stage it is quite a significant development it happened early thursday morning was first detected by the japanese coast guard later confirmed by officials here in south korea as being two projectiles flying some 450 kilometers and both japanese and u.s officials are now saying that these were ballistic missiles now this is the first time in a year that north korea has launched one of these provocative type of tests for the past couple of years since the negotiations between north korea and the u.s over denuclearization broke down it has returned to developing and testing its missiles and weapon systems but they have tended to be less provocative shorter range missiles and rockets being fired off its coast the kind of weapons that are not banned by un resolutions and in fact only last weekend it was confirmed that they had fired off two cruise type missiles the white house has largely ignored that u.s president joe biden saying that that was no big deal that it was business as usual ballistic missiles are a lot harder to ignore we have also had this condemnation from the japanese prime minister yoshihide it is a threat to our country and to regional security it's also a violation of the united nations security council resolution we'll strictly protest and condemn their actions i'm determined to closely cooperate with the united states south korea and other related nations to protect the lives of our people and rob the timing is significant isn't it with senior u.s diplomats recently visiting asia to formulate policy on north korea that's right we have a change in u.s administration anthony blinken the u.s secretary of state was in northeast asia meeting with his counterparts in japan south korea just last week as they are formulating what their strategy will be towards north korea now the north koreans confirmed during that visit that they had received overtures from u.s officials about restarting dialogue which they said they basically ignored and it but it was thought by other statements that they would wait and see just what the policy was not carry out any kind of provocations while the u.s comes up with whatever their strategy is it seems by this test that possibly north korea has had a change of heart it sees no point in waiting possibly it has nothing to lose by firing off these kind of missiles at this point and if anything might add pressure and discomfort on the u.s administration all right rob mcbride live for us there in seoul rob thank you
