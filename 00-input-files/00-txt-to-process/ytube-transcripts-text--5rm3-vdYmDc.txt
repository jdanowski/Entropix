this is where i see the most similarity in 1984 by georgio westbrook his story is constantly being rewritten history is being forgotten erased and changed and nobody knows what is the truth anymore after this what we have here is a truly blessing what we have is a gift and we need to protect this precious freedom whatever the cause might be [Music] hi guys welcome to my channel my name is yemi park and i am a north korean defector human rights activist so today in this video i am going to talk about north korea's tragic death of actresses and actors i will talk about why these actors and actresses are the main target from the regime and they actually have the shortest lifespan you can have even though general population north korea do not live until even 60 years old for these actors to get killed before they are 40 is highly likely i will explain why this is the case one of the shock that i had when i came out of north korea was observing celebrity culture in the west how people were obsessed with hollywood i didn't even not know who michael jackson was or even justin bieber was in north korea we do love our movie stars and you know people on the tv however they are so we are not allowed to worship anybody other than the party and teams so we don't even know where to find these actors names are or their ages are right here you have wikipedia or google you can just search where they're from what's their story is and you can even join social media to support your fans i mean support your stars however in north korea that's not impossible so we don't even have the vocabulary called something fun today i chose this topic is because i think this really demonstrates how north korean people in every sector has been abused by the regime so kim jong-il was a known womanizer and the way that he wanted to show his loyalty to his own father was creating this pleasure squad creating this young girl's virgin and giving it his father to please him literally called the pleasure squad but he did not just kim jong il did not stop there he had from his office he had his other underground railroad he literally just built apartment uh right next to his office so he could go underground road whenever he can pop up and abuse this actor actresses and recently we just got this data from north korea so in north korea there is a group called 101 uh group 101 is nothing special a lot of north korean groups are named at after number like we talked about in the previous video 39 bureau the number 39 bureau is like the that the day that kim min kim jong-un said create this kind of project so one-on-one group is also the same thing october 9th kim jong-un said why don't you guys create this special group to cracking down on the people who has unlimited power to punish anybody watch or listen consume any foreign media all the media that is banned in north korea so they gave the list of the things the north korean people should not watch and 101 this group got the list and i can show you some of the examples here so this is the this is the interesting about this this list is that actually it's not about saying don't watch hollywood movies don't watch south korean k-pop or like bollywood movies these are the movies that at one point the regime said every citizen every person north korea must watch and learn and be brainwashed but they gave this like unlimited list of the movies and songs that north korean people cannot consume and if they do they get punished why is that so basically the regime says don't even watch foreign videos okay we get it that makes sense but then don't even watch the movie that we once told you guys to watch this is where i see the most similarity in 1984 by georgio westbrook his story is constantly being rewritten history is being forgotten erased and changed and nobody knows what is the truth anymore after this if you do this for like three times so the one time these movies were great that it made them happy but because the one actor one actress got killed in that movie then instantly they becomes the enemy of the people and nobody in north korea should watch the movie so maybe 10 years ago the movie was okay but now like maybe eight years later they say don't watch it then we cannot like possibly also keep following up with the changing regulation because every single day they change their mind one day this was okay one day this is not okay and so the reason why some of these women got executed was some of them were the mistresses of zhang sang the uncle of kim jong-un who was a very powerful man and how can you say no to him and some of them was awesome mistress of kim jong-il who was known to be a womanizer and when your god calls you of course you gotta go he literally make these women divorce their husband and make them enslaved to them and another heartbreaking is that it's not just raping them that is horribly safe but once kim jong-il sleeps with them and then they he has done having fun then he literally gifting this woman like a like a object and giving it to somebody that you know he likes next to him then these women pass to them and they they do their thing and then once they are done they are doing the exact same thing they give you to they are like senior junior somebody pro i mean helping them out so these actresses in north korea have been passed around like slaves and they are slaves this actress and nobody in north korea can live their own life their only life purpose is serving this dictator giving them the pleasure that they want to they desire it is uh sometimes i was really like confused when i came to the west and like how people you know i literally remember one day i was uh giving a speech and they were like the kindergartner or some i mean i don't even know the name basically it's victoria secrets like the kim kardashian family was there and i obviously have no clue who they are and i remember my editor was asking i mean you don't know who's kim kardashian he's like you know who is that and they're like maybe better is you don't know and then they showed me their like the social media following and i couldn't believe how much uh influencer can have that much influence i'm not saying it's a bad thing but i used to think like wow maybe people feel really obsessed with celebrities but now i'm thinking that's way better like we have a freedom to choose whoever we worship or adore we support and in north korea even the object the subject of celebration like usually these actors and actresses are the slaves and they are the one actually suffer one of the most class too and it is heartbreaking to see how the regime is keep erasing the north korean history that now nobody knows what happened to us so i hope that you guys learning about north korea help you to understand what we have here is a truly blessing what we have is a gift and we need to protect this precious freedom whatever the cause might be so
