we all wondered about what those brown color liquid would taste like it is like sometimes really hard to believe like how am i experiencing these two contradicting universe in the same lifetime but chinese people sold this dog sausage to nursing people as like human food [Music] hi everybody welcome to my channel my name is andy park i am a north korean defector human rights activist i have talked about what an average meal looked like for nursing people in my previous video but this time i am going to talk about what does fan smear look like for north korean so here is the top 5 list that north koreans regard as the most high-end and fancy food number one you have guessed it instant ramyan so this was such a shocking thing when i went to south korea and they hear news about like north koreans are stuck going hungry at night and we all really you know a lot of times even dying from starvation and they will say like why is don't you eat some ramen like why would you die from starvation you can eat some ramen at least and i was like oh my god you have no idea that instant ramen that people think is not healthy for you is considered to be the most like desired food as soon as one of our neighborhoods like neighbors started cooking this instant ramen you know when you're really hungry and there's not much food going on you're like knows the sense really heightens you right now living in the west there's so many restaurants and so much food smelling on the street you don't really notice that much like oh they are eating chicken they are eating like this or that but in north korea when everything is not there even tiny thing that the stove smells can travel so far away that's why i was always saying like i was able to smear those like delicious food from across the river from china and even i smell those plastics they're floating from china side i could smell them and they were so nice and therefore as soon as somebody starts like cooking ramen you smell it so far away everybody knows who is having ramen that night they are the like end views of people in that town i only ate ramen like one time max i think that's the one time i clearly remember other times i was close to the people who were eating it so that doesn't count i was tasting this ramen for the first time in my life and the first thing i remember was she was too oily i never ate a food that had that much oil in it in north korea the cooking oil is very precious so we don't add that much oil in the food however in this instant ramen i think it was supposedly coming from china so early i couldn't really like get it down but even i was really hungry so i was didn't care like if feeling my taste or not was so yummy and this is the thing if you can able to eat ramen every day you will be the most richiest and envious person in north korea right now number two the second fastest food yep that's right coca-cola i never get to taste coca-cola uh i i tasted something similar to sprout sprite however coca-cola is really reserved very top elite people in pyongyang and some people in the countryside if you get to pick the coca-cola butter in the river some are floating from china side you are so lucky that they because you can sell the coca-cola butter to the people in the black market i was always going hunting for butters and you know i always like knew even the coca-cola the butters were so made like strong and differently than other like juice we all wondered about what those brown color liquid would taste like and it tastes amazing when i tasted it for the first time i think china i tasted however the the soda that now i hear in america talking about like sodas are bad for you should not drink it and people in north korea you know it's like they treat this coca-cola like almost like gold or something number three cookies and candies but again it's not freshly made cookies or candies it's all processed in the like areas it lasts for eight years and years if you can get those processed cookies and candies you're so rich whenever we go to a holidays and go to rich people house sometimes then they would have this a tiny tiny ball like which is like a snack ball and then put it on the guests when they come in the table and you know either you need to have a manner so maximum you should pick it's like one tiny candy and or like a chinese cookie who is processed and they just as soon as i put them in my mouth they just melted so quickly i really hated how quickly it goes away in my mouth and i never thought in my life that the food that we i thought it was the most delicious thing was considered to be something unhealthy that people try to get rid of it is like sometimes really hard to believe like how am i experiencing these two contradicting universe in the same lifetime it's almost like people talk about this like oh i heard from like when i was young like 50 years ago 30 years ago i went through this but i'm talking something about like happened to me not many years ago so it feels really weird anyway so number four canned foods anything that is can norris can be brought obsessed with that i mean the fact that there's really not running transportation we don't have the running refrigerator we cannot really store things a long time therefore canned food is really desired however north korea does not have a technology to make the canned foods and make them last so this is the only coming from china or the elite people when they go growth they bring sun with them i remember when i was young my father went to pyongyang for a work trip and several months later when he came home he brought this one canned i think fish i don't even remember tasting it because when when we don't have a can opener because we don't eat cans at all like that never happens to most of people only special people get to see the candy food and like try them so we did not know how to open the can right and my father tried and then he was like okay we will try later my mom prepared and i couldn't give up so when they were like out i was trying to open this candy knife and actually i cut my hair hand here i said can i see this long scar i was bleeding so much because i myself i blessed so much and still didn't don't remember how that canned fish tasted like and now again like here in america people say don't eat canned you know fruits candy canned fish and this is so so weird if you can so that's the thing like when i go to north korea i will bring bags of you know instant ramyan and coca-cola cookies and then some lots of canned food and i will be so popular they will love me for that lastly spam or sausage so somehow some really like if you can buy this sausage from china and now what of course we heard later is that the people in china use the the sausage the meat they use were not really not good meat however it doesn't really matter like there's really no concept in north korea called like junk food like if you don't really know what that is so it took a while for me to understand like how can be how can food be bad right like almost like to me like food was something that helps me grow and help me to be alive and never connected you to something that can harm me therefore this sausage and spam what are we really considered to be fancy food you'd only get try like one slice on the new years in a fancy homes and i remember i went to south korea no no no in china actually there was a dog uh the human trafficker owned and dog and they said like you should we should buy something for for your dog and i didn't know what it was and they were eventually picking up the sausage that i couldn't i thought that was human food but chinese people saw this dog sausage to nursing people as like human food so all the time that i admire this sausage was turned out to be a dog food i still like the dog sausage though is it somewhere smells so good but i cannot believe like who how the translation got lost or maybe north korean vendors knew it was dog food but still nursing people would not know what it is that they're going to pay for it however what it was in north korea what i was eating i thought was sausage but it was dog sausage and how many i don't know like i'm sure it's all fine anyway this is like top five food that no skin people think is the most like fancy food i took my mom recently to when she came to napa valley with me to three like michelin star restaurant and it was really really expensive for me but i really thought like i want my mom to experience have this experience for alice once in her life and that's like what i felt like so i took her and he literally lasted like over five hours and the first thing they were bringing in this like three michelin star restaurant is this like oh this is like a hand picked radish from our farm right there and then that's like what we were paying for and this is hard to get the reservation and i was thinking my mom and we were thinking like we had three michelin star like mirror every single mirror in north korea everything was hand-picked everything was grown in our like farm like in from over our yards and here in america like that is like people paying almost fortune to eat those food and in north korea and people are dying to eat the food that we try to get rid of here understanding culture really helped me to be a critical thinker i really hope with that you are enjoying this journey with me to get to know each other's culture as much as i am and please teach me if there are more things that i i'm so curious about learning about all the culture in this world and i really hope to stay in touch and look forward to seeing you guys next video bye
