>> Sean: WE HAVE COVERED ON THIS PROGRAM NIGHT AFTER NIGHT FAR LEFT IDEOLOGIES INFILTRATING OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM FROM GRADE SCHOOL INTO COLLEGE GETTING SO BAD THAT EVEN THOSE WHO HAVE FLED FROM TOTALITARIAN REGIMES SEEKING FREEDOM IN AMERICA IN SEARCH OF FREEDOM OF THOUGHT TAKING NOTICE. AN ACTUAL DEFECTOR FROM NORTH KOREA WHO ATTENDED THE IVY LEAGUE INSTITUTION KNOWN AS COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY IS SPEAKING OUT TELLING FOXNews.com THAT CLIMATE INSIDE COLUMBIA REMINDS HER OF NORTH KOREA LIGHTING SEEMS LIKE ANTI-WESTERN SENTIMENT, COLLECTIVE GUILT, SUFFOCATING POLITICAL CORRECTNESS FOR EXAMPLE DURING ORIENTATION SHE SAID SHE WAS SCOLDED FOR SAYING THAT SHE ENJOYED THE WORKS OF ACCLAIMED AUTHOR JANE AUSTEN AND WAS TOLD THE BOOKS ARE RACIST ALONG WITH BEING SUBJECTED TO WHAT SHE SAW AS NONSTOP ANTI-AMERICAN PROPAGANDA. HERE TO TELL HER STORY IS NORTH KOREA DEFECTOR ALONG WITH FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR MIKE HUCKABEE. I READ THIS STORY, YOU GREW UP AND HOW MANY YEARS -- YOU WERE IN NORTH KOREA 20 YEARS AND YOU THINK THE INDOCTRINATION IN THE UNITED STATES AT HER IVY LEAGUE INSTITUTION COLUMBIA IS AS BAD OR WORSE AS THE PROPAGANDA ANTI-AMERICAN HATE THAT YOU HEARD IN NORTH KOREA? >> WHEN I WAS IN NORTH KOREA, THE FIRST THING THAT I LEARNED WAS AMERICANS WERE THIS PROBLEM SAYING HOW MANY AMERICAN AND AS A CHILD IN NORTH KOREA, YOU HAVE TO. AND I SAID I LOVE THIS COUNTRY, THIS IS SUCH A LOVABLE COUNTRY. I'VE NEVER BEEN ACCEPTED IN THIS COUNTRY AND COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY, LITERALLY EVERY PROFESSOR WAS SAYING THE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE IN TODAY'S WORLD IS BECAUSE OF WHITE MEN. ASIA, THAT'S HOW THEY MESS UP EVERYTHING AND THEY ARE THE ONES THAT I COULDN'T BELIEVE I WAS SITTING IN NORTH KOREA'S CLASSROOM IN AMERICA, I COULDN'T BELIEVE MY PEOPLE WERE HATING THEIR OWN PEOPLE THAT MUCH. >> Sean: WHAT IS YOUR OVERALL THOUGHT WHEN YOU LOOK AT AMERICA TODAY AND YOU COMPARE IT WITH YOUR LIFE EXPERIENCE WHICH HAS BEEN HORRIFIC, SOLD INTO SLAVERY AT ONE POINT IN YOUR LIFE, YOU ARE EXPECTING THIS TO BE THE LAND OF THE FREE IN THE HOME OF THE BRAVE AND THE LAND OF FREEDOM AND YOU GET THE EXACT SAME PROPAGANDA HERE. >> IT'S HEARTBREAKING. I WAS SOLD AS A AND I CROSSED THE DESERT TO BE FREE AND NOW I THOUGHT I LIVE IN A COUNTRY WHERE I CAN SAY WERE I BELIEVE AND HAVE MY FREEDOM TO THINK. I HAVE TO CONSTANTLY CENSOR MY SPEECH BECAUSE COLUMBIA TOLD US WE CAN'T TALK ABOUT AND I AM SO CONCERNED IF AMERICA IS NOT  FREE, THAT'S WHY IT'S REALLY ALARMING TO ME. >> Sean: SOMETIMES WHEN YOU WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF WHAT I CALL INCREMENTALISM'S STEP-BY-STEP, WE NOW KNOW WHAT CANCEL CULTURE IS, WE KNOW WHAT IS POLITICALLY INCORRECT AND THEN TO HEAR THIS DOES IT REALLY ME BUT HEARING IT STILL SHOCKS ME IF THAT MAKES ANY SENSE. >> I'LL TELL YOU WHAT WOULD MAKE A LOT OF SENSE. WHY DON'T WE GET HER A TOUR BUS AND WE WILL PAY FOR IT, YOU AND ME AND WE WILL SEND HER TO EVERY COLLEGE CAMPUS IN AMERICA AND LET THIS REMARKABLE YOUNG WOMAN SPEAK AND TELL HER STORY AND LET PEOPLE KNOW I'M GIVING AWAY SOMETHING THEY CAN NEVER GET BACK AND I'M SO PROUD OF HER. YOU HAVE NO IDEA. HOW GRATEFUL I AM FOR THE COURAGE AND THE CLARITY OF HER STORY AND I JUST WANT TO TELL HER THERE ARE A LOT OF US WHO LOVE AMERICA, WHO STILL BELIEVE IN FREEDOM AND WE BELIEVE IN YOU AND WE ARE GRATEFUL THAT YOU ARE HERE IN YOUR MESSAGE IS ONE THAT I HOPE EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN WILL HEAR. I KNOW SOME OF THEM WON'T, THOSE PEOPLE THAT WERE TAUGHT TO BELIEVE, THEY PROBABLY WON'T CARE BUT ALL OF US ARE NOT LIKE THAT, WE REALLY AREN'T. >> Sean: YOU SHOULD READ SOME OF MIKE'S BOOKS ABOUT SOUTHERN SAYINGS. REMEMBER THIS SPEECH? I BELIEVE IF MY MEMORY SERVES ME RIGHT, HERE IS A GUY WHO FORMER SOVIET UNION SAYING YOU'RE GETTING BAD HERE TOO AND HERE'S WHAT YOU ARE DOING WRONG. WOULD YOU CONSIDER THIS TRIP, THIS BUS TRIP THAT GOVERNOR HUCKABEE IS TALKING ABOUT, CONSIDER GOING TO COLLEGE CAMPUSES ALTHOUGH I HAVE TO WARN YOU, YOU WOULD PROBABLY BE PROTESTED AND THEY WOULD TRY TO CANCEL YOU WHEN SHUT YOU DOWN BECAUSE THAT HAPPENS AS A CONSERVATIVE I CAN TELL YOU EVERY CONSERVATIVE I KNOW LIVE THROUGH THAT EXPERIENCE. >> I HAVE BEEN ON THE KILLING LIST OF PEOPLE FOR MANY YEARS BECAUSE I SPOKE OUT AND BUY ORIGINAL FAMILY GOT PUNISHED BUT NOW IRONICALLY ENOUGH, SO MANY MARXISTS AND COMMUNISTS NOW ARE SENDING ME DEATH THREATS AND IS IT SUCH AN IRONY THAT I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO RESPOND THAT THIS IS A WAR THAT AGAIN SOCIALISM AND COMMUNISM, THE FACT THAT I COME FROM NORTH KOREA AND SAY NORTH KOREA BEGAN AS AN EQUAL SOCIETY AND NOW THE REGIME'S DIFFERENT CLASSES BASED ON YOUR STATUS, BASED ON WHAT YOUR GRANDFATHER DID AND WHEN I WENT TO COLUMBIA, THEY SAID YOU MUST BE GUILTY. YOU AUTHORIZE THIS BECAUSE YOU WERE WHITE. YOU DON'T CHOOSE YOUR ANCESTORS, YOU DON'T CHOOSE YOUR RACE AND PEOPLE SHOULDN'T BE PUNISHED IN THE SAME THING IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. >> Sean: YOUR TESTIMONY IS POWERFUL. THE BIBLE SAYS T
