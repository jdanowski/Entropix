something we're constantly being asked to make a video about the relationship between the eu and north korea oh oh wait huh look at that no one's ever asked us to write about this oh and it's not even in the news okay well so maybe it's not a video that's highly in demand but we promise it's interesting so in this video we're going to start by looking at this relationship we'll go into the recent controversy around it why the eu could be doing more to ease tensions in north korea and exactly why their current strategy has failed let's start by explaining exactly how the eu has approached the tricky subjects of north korea up until now it's fairly obvious why you don't regularly if ever hear about this relationship one side originated as a trading block aiming to improve the economic situation across the continent prevent a third world war and the creation of another autocratic war-mongering state the other is on the other side of the planet led by an autocratic regime and is regularly accused of human rights violations neither has any real reason to interact or at least that's what you think like any diplomatic nation brussels would ideally like to see north korea as stable from a security standpoint and would like to see human rights respected as a huge economic trading bloc it has a huge amount of power to affect such change so while theoretically the eu could sit on the sidelines and leave the growing tensions in north korea to other nations and groups to deal with such as the us nato and un it hasn't done this it's tried to engage with the situation using its considerable power however in recent months scholars have been quick to criticize the eu's role in north korea one article by theresa novotna of the friends of europe think tank has argued that the eu has not gone far enough she argues that as the u.s president seems to have lost interest in north korea and as little progress is being made by the us in north korea the eu should try and fill this vacuum pyongyang would see the eu as a more neutral country and could be willing to negotiate on issues such as denuclearization she also states that this shouldn't be a foreign concept to the eu she explains this succinctly by stating that a complete change of the paradigm between parties formerly at war should not be an alien concept to the eu after all this is how european integration started in fact eric balbach writing for the alcano royal institute makes a similar argument he however makes an even bolder statement that not only is the eu not doing enough but its current and previous strategies have demonstrably failed and a new approach is needed in order to understand the arguments presented by both of these papers a history of the eu and north korea must first be understood fortunately bullbak provides a brief history in his paper which we'll summarize here he argues that the relationship can be broken down into three distinct periods each with their own distinct approaches the first is 1995-2002 which he claims is the active engagement phase this is when the eu is most generous and lenient with north korea they provided huge sums of money to the north korean regime to help with food aid structural food assistance humanitarian assistance and technical assistance and this aid totaled 400 million euros as can be seen by the reasons the eu gave the money this was being done for the sake of humanitarian purposes and is something they continued doing until the early 2010s in addition to humanitarian aid the eu also had political dialogue with north korea starting in 1998. between 98 and 2015 14 meetings were held between the eu and north korea and things appeared to be going well between the eu and north korea in fact a delegation from europe visited the country to have a special meeting with kim jong-il the purpose of this meeting was to ensure that missile testing would stop at least until 2003 something that both sides agreed on however in the second nuclear crisis of 2002 the kim jong-il regime resumed missile testing undoing this agreement therefore bullbark argues that the eu went into the second phase of their relationship with north korea which he calls critical engagement this period lasted between 2002 and 2013 and is basically the eu getting harsher it withdrew its programmes designed to aid the north korean economy and stopped opening its own market to the north koreans however it did still provide aid most notably in 2011 when 10 million euros was given to aid the north korean food crisis the last and most recent phase is active pressure and this represented an even further harshening of the eu's stance towards north korea the reason behind this likely lay in the new supreme leader kim jong-un's increased missile testing a good example of this was the fact that official channels of communication between the eu and north korea were cut although informal channels remained open the eu effectively stood back from engaging with north korea this is further demonstrated by a huge array of sanctions that have been imposed on the country since 2013. this includes a ban on eu member states from transferring funds to and from the dprk unless it's for a certain predefined purpose and authorized in advance and since 2016 a huge array of materials were also banned from being exported from the eu to north korea including iron coal electrical equipment machinery and seafood so this is bulbar summary of the eu north korean relationship over the last two decades his criticism of the approach by the eu is that it's lackluster it does not foster engagement between the eu and north korea and it doesn't utilize the unique position that the eu is in and this is an opinion that seems to be shared by theresa novotna but before we explain exactly what they both think the eu should do in relation to north korea let's look at why bulbar thinks that the eu has failed with its approach he argues that the eu has failed for two main reasons that their goals haven't been met reducing tension in the korean peninsula and improving the human rights situation and their policies have led to a diminished role for the eu bordering on irrelevancy so firstly have tensions in north korea been high and is the humanitarian situation bad well let's just take a look at some tweets and news headlines and i'll let you judge for yourself yeah okay it's fair to say that the eu imposing some sanctions on north korea hasn't really worked in easing tensions so what about the eu's other objective about the human rights situation well earlier this week a report was published by human rights watch that looked into the conditions in prisons in north korean pre-trial this paper was entitled worse less than an animal so that should give you an idea of what tone the report took the report includes interviews with 22 north koreans that were detained following the ascension of kim jong-un to the position of supreme leader it also includes the accounts of eight former officials who fled the country as we can't summarize the entire report here we'd recommend giving it a flick through it's genuinely harrowing and well worth the read one of the stories mentioned in the report is that of lim o kyung who is detained for importing home appliances from china as her husband had good connections to the party she was released after only 10 days but her experience was still brutal she was beaten repeatedly during questioning and then told to write down everything about herself apparently from the moment of her birth until the present the following day a guard came in told her that it was all made up beat her and then told her to do it all over again following this she was made to stand up in herself for five days refused any sleep in fact this paragraph of the report summarizes the experiences of those involved it's clear therefore that the human rights situation in north korea hasn't improved much either neither the de-escalation of tension nor the improvements in human rights have been successful and therefore bullbark seems right that the eu have failed in their objectives as for the second reason why their policy has failed it's clear that the eu doesn't have much influence over north korea anymore this according to bulbar is because the eu insists on complete nuclear disarmament before formal discussions can resume as the eu has virtually no diplomatic clause in this area it's effectively shot itself in the foot it does not have the power to insist that nuclear disarmament happens and will not talk until this does happen the eu's power in this area is therefore weakened due to its policy so what do bullbach and novotna argue is the approach that the eu should take we'll both argue that an increased dialogue would greatly improve not only their standing in the region but also the stability of the region more generally the eu is in a position where it can talk to both the us and north korea and could end up arbitrating in a dispute novotna argues that brussels should together with berlin come up with an independent blueprint for the north korean peninsula that will be seen as neutral and objective by pyongyang there's no doubt that the dprk negotiators would be thrilled bulbar additionally demonstrates that sweden has already independently held high-level meetings between the us and north korea and allowed for additional dialogue between regimes he also argues that such meetings are useful for understanding the motives and objectives of north korea and that this in turn would improve trust in the longer term this makes the eu less dependent on the relationship between the us and north korea or south korea and north korea because a level of trust could be built up independently of these relationships but what do you think could this foster a more stable region or could this backfire and make it look like the eu is helping an undemocratic and authoritarian regime let us know your thoughts in the comments below be sure to subscribe the channel and hit the bell icon to be notified every time we
