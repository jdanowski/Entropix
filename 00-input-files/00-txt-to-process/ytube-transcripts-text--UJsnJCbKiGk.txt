welcome to the eyeopener i'm your host michael lewis a french company alerted the us of imminent radiological threat at a chinese nuclear power plant but the ccp says everything is under control american bishops will meet tomorrow to discuss whether to bar politicians who go against catholic teachings from receiving communion two nevada counties declared they're going to go constitutional what does it mean a north korean defector is shocked at the radical ideologies in american universities she said it felt like the regression in civilization okay my friends let's take a closer look together [Music] in southern china the taishan nuclear power plant is reportedly leaking due to issues in the reactor french company framatome which partially operates the power plant has reached out to the u.s energy department for assistance framitom said in a letter quote the situation is an imminent radiological threat to the site and to the public the french company tried to obtain a waiver from the u.s that would allow it to share american technical assistance with their staff to address the issue but messages from chinese officials are very different state-owned china general nuclear power group cgn says the situation is under control and the plant is safe cnn noted quote it is unusual that a foreign company would unilaterally reach out to the american government for help when its chinese state-owned partner is yet to acknowledge a problem exists this statement is at least incorrect the ccp likes to project that everything is just fine if it could it would never report a problem as of monday u.s officials concluded the plant leak is not at crisis levels however the center of the controversy is the ccp safety agency continues to increase the limits on the amount of gas that can safely be released from the facility to a level that makes the french company uncomfortable the limit was double the initial release amount it's posing off-site risk to the public and on-site workers afp news agency tweeted on monday a chinese nuclear company has deliberately released gas from a power plant into the atmosphere within authorized limits as it seeks to fix an issue at the facility framatome's parent company edf which owns 30 of taishan plant has called an extraordinary meeting with its chinese partners to review data from the reactor with the closest margin ever israel's government to knesset confirmed a new prime minister on june 13th naphtali bennett was sworn in with a vote 60-59 he heads a coalition of parties that replaced benjamin netanyahu for the first time in 12 years in a speech before the vote bennett said that the rekindling of nuclear talks with iran was a mistake that would give a certain amount of legitimacy to iran's terrorist efforts throughout the region he vowed that israel would never allow iran to become a nuclear power bennett also addressed biden directly he thanked him for his support in the war and used the word bipartisan to describe israel's efforts to reach out to both major american political parties bennett leads the right-wing yamina party that opposes palestinian independence and strongly supports jewish settlements in the occupied west bank and east jerusalem however palestinians and much of the international community see them as a major obstacle to peace but bennett's stance is being questioned by his new coalition which only has a narrow majority in parliament and includes parties from the right left and center the coalition was largely united by its desire to oust netanyahu and varies widely along an ideological spectrum otherwise biden sent his congratulations to bennett and asserted israel has no better friend than the united states under the coalition bennett will retain the role of prime minister for two years before political centrist yaer lapid takes over lapid is currently the foreign minister american bishops will discuss whether the catholic church should prohibit pro-abortion and pro-lgbtq politicians from receiving communion at their annual conference that starts tomorrow currently church leaders remain divided on the issue the topic is a delicate one since politicians including the president support abortion and same-sex marriage that are contrary to catholic doctrine some church leaders believe these politicians shouldn't be allowed to receive the sacrament over their political stance they are setting an example that you can go against church teachings and still receive communion cardinal raymond burke even suggests to label such politicians as apostates people who renounce the religious beliefs the annual conference of catholic bishops isn't going to create immediate changes instead the meeting will start the process of drafting documents that outline the church's stance on the issues as well as possible procedures to label apostates in april the biden administration lifted restrictions on federal funding for medical research involving tissues derived from elective abortions in new jersey the board of education in randolph decided to replace the names of holidays with the words day off on its school calendar a decision shocked many who attended the board meeting last month the board was considering changing the name of columbus day which some consider offensive to native americans members of italian organization voiced their opposition to the renaming they explained the meeting and importance of columbus day to italian americans and said the story of columbus wasn't properly told by historians the board's motion was initially to remove holidays mentioning ethnic or religious groups in an effort not to offend any group however at the meeting last thursday the board took an extreme move to strip off all holiday names replacing them with the meaningless day off so not only religious holidays will be gone father's day mother's day veterans day thanksgiving day all of them will be gone the board thinks students would be better off not knowing what they're celebrating the left pushes for inclusion and diversity and at the same time cancels them to be really inclusive students should be taught to accept each other's differences and become tolerant rather than to always fear offending someone by their differences many religions such as christianity and judaism actually teach followers to be tolerant of other religious beliefs besides each holiday has its own significance it's far more meaningful than a day off from school on memorial day for example students should be taught to honor american soldiers who died for this country canceling the names of holidays is canceling history and promoting ignorance wouldn't it be beautiful idea if we could all learn to celebrate the memorable things in each other's lives we hope the randolph board of education will receive enough pushback to reverse its decision now before we continue please hit that like button and subscribe and don't forget to share this video with your friends and family and today i want to make a special toast to two amazing eye opener supporters eric blunt and my main man lance taylor thank you so much for supporting and sending these terrific pictures of your mugs that matter everyone please grab your mug and allow me to say thank you eric and lance and to everyone who watches the show right now you are all my motivation to work hard every day salute a north korean defector who studied at columbia university in 2016 was deeply disturbed by the rampant radical ideologies at one of the country's most prestigious universities yonmi park is 27 years old she escaped north korea with her mother in 2007. her journey to freedom took her through china mongolia south korea and finally america however to her surprise she found so many similarities in this country to what she saw back in north korea anti-western sentiment collective guilt and suffocating political correctness park said she loves classic literature such as jane austen but at orientation she was scalded by a staff member who told her those writings had a colonial mindset they were racist and bigots and are subconsciously brainwashing you park was also shocked and confused that in every class students were asked their preferred pronouns she said it felt like the regression in civilization in north korea people don't have internet they don't have access to different narrative just communism in america people have access to everything while enjoying this freedom park found too many choose to be brainwashed and they deny it americans have been born into freedom sometimes we forget how precious freedom is however for people who had lived under communist rule they can easily spot this problem in today's american society that's why we need history we can learn from the wisdom of our ancestors and draw inspiration from the past to educate ourselves but the left sees this too they distorted how america was founded how the founding fathers sacrificed their lives for the freedom of the american people western civilization is being twisted into a radical race struggle it is ridiculous but this ridiculousness isn't easily seen by those who've been taught this way from a young age this so-called wokeness has greatly affected students ability to think rusty renault editor of the magazine first things explained why he stopped hiring ivy league graduates ten years ago ivy league graduates had a sense of entitlement and arrogance reynolds said some of these students would want to write the lead story on day one but these shortcomings still have a positive side such as confidence and ambition you can live with it the editor said however in just 10 years these ivy league graduates have developed a kind of distorted view of reality but now i'm seeing these young people that they have to be frank a kind of distorted view of reality i mean pronouns worrying about pronouns i mean how can you get work done if everybody's tiptoeing around the office worried about setting you know triggering someone sure and and so i think that that's that's uh that's a big change i think in the last decade renault wrote i have no doubt that ivy league universities attract smart talented and ambitious kids but do these institutions add value my answer is increasingly negative another characteristic renault saw in these graduates was dimitude dimitude refers to the mentality of those who have accepted their subordinate role in school the editor wrote in the past decade dimitude had become widespread normal kids at elite universities keep their heads down over the course of four years this can become a subtle but real habit of obeisance a condition of moral and spiritual surrender these are simply not characteristics of good employees instead renault recommended a list of institutions he advises young people to attend many of them are small catholic colleges in his experience graduates from these places are well educated and not deformed by the toxic political correctness that leaders of elite universities have accepted as the norm the editor also recommended large state universities and their satellite schools he said students from these institutions are more likely to accept the authority of those more experienced which allows for better mentoring and produces better results in the long run cancer culture is dominating college campuses and is producing dimitude to defend free speech in colleges and universities two house republicans jim jordan and kat kamik launched the campus free speech caucus this week the caucus will work with young america's foundation a conservative youth organization to educate other legislators about anti-conservative biases found on college campuses nationwide jordan and kamek will meet with leadership and students of the foundation regularly to learn about current situations kamik said free speech is a core freedom that must be preserved at a time when university leadership and students are caving to the pressure of liberal progressivism my colleagues in congress will stand up for the first amendment and ensure all have the rights to exercise their thoughts and ideas freely and without persecution two counties in nevada have decided to go constitutional elected commissioners in elko and lander counties declared that the bill of rights will be upheld in their jurisdiction even if it means standing against unconstitutional acts by the state and federal authorities on june 2nd elko county approved a resolution that makes it a crime to abuse the constitutional rights of its citizens officials in lander county quickly followed suit the two county governments also became the first in the nation to officially join the constitutional sheriff's and peace officers association other known as cspoa the cspoa is made up of sheriffs and other law enforcement officials dedicated to upholding their oaths of office to the u.s and their state constitutions so what does going constitutional mean alco county's resolution echoes the language of america's founders in the declaration of independence it says its citizens must be free from infringement on the rights protected by the constitution such as the rights to keep and bear arms rights to freedom of speech religion and assembly the resolution also reaffirms the 10th amendment protecting the county from unauthorized federal overreach it notes no federal agency can create policies that supersede the constitution elko county commissioner rex stinninger who proposed the resolution called on counties across america to take similar actions in defense of the constitution stenninger said the introduction of the resolution is to combat an increasingly invasive federal government he said we need a majority of counties in all the freedom-loving states to join we were slipping quickly from the republic of our founding into a dictatorship according to stenninger the public had been overwhelmingly supportive of the county's move the commissioner stressed that the constitution enabled america to rise from a fledgling collection of immigrants to the most powerful nation on earth it was the freedom's enshrined in the constitution that allowed our citizens to flourish and excel as the word spreads and citizens across america get involved sheriff richard mack president of the cspoa said that these two counties are likely just the beginning and that's it for today my friends check out this playlist right here for
