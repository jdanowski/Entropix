[Music] north korea has tested a series of different missiles including short medium intermediate and intercontinental range and submarine launched ballistic missiles the size of the country's nuclear stockpile is currently unknown pyongyang could have between 20 and 60 assembled nuclear weapons according to various estimates by experts u.s intelligence officials estimated in 2018 that north korea has enough fissile material the core component of nuclear weapons for 65 weapons and that every year it produces enough fissile material for 12 additional weapons the regime successfully tested intercontinental ballistic missiles icbm each capable of carrying a large nuclear warhead pyongyang said that in its testing of the hwasong-15 icbm the missile hit an altitude of 4475 kilometers 2780 miles far above the international space station and flew about 1 000 kilometers 590 miles before landing in the sea off japan's coast analysts estimate the hwasong-15 has a potential range of 13 000 kilometers 8 100 miles and if fired on a flatter trajectory could reach anywhere on the u.s mainland north korea unveiled a new icbm larger than the hwasong-15 during a military parade in october 2020 carried on an 11-axle vehicle it is believed to be one of the world's largest road mobile liquid-fueled missiles although the missile has not yet been tested and possibly won't be for months or years analysts said it could potentially carry multiple nuclear warheads or decoys to confuse missile defense systems american analysts and experts from other countries still debate the nuclear payload that the country's icbms could carry and it is still unclear whether the icbms have the capability to survive re-entry a confidential u.s intelligence assessment from july 2017 reportedly concluded that north korea has developed the technology to miniaturize a nuclear warhead to fit its ballistic missiles and some experts caution that it is only a matter of time before north korea completes its nuclear force we're going to have to learn to live with north korea's ability to target the united states with nuclear weapons said jeffrey lewis of the middlebury institute of strategic studies north korea has conducted six nuclear tests first in october 2006 and then in may 2009 under kim jong-il under kim jong-un's leadership the country detonated weapons in february 2013 january and september 2016 and september 2017. the regime possesses the know how to produce bombs with weapons grade uranium or plutonium the primary elements required for making thistle material with each test north korea's nuclear explosions have grown in power the first explosion in 2006 was a plutonium-fueled atomic bomb with a yield equivalent to two kilotons of tnt an energy unit used to measure the power of an explosive blast the 2009 test had a yield of eight kilotons the 2013 and january 2016 tests both had yields of approximately 17 kilotons and the september 2016 test had a yield of 35 kilotons according to data from the nuclear threat initiative a washington dc-based non-partisan think tank for comparison the u.s bomb dropped on hiroshima in 1945 the first atom bomb had an estimated yield of 16 kilotons as the power of the north's nuclear tests intensified so too did the pace of both the country's nuclear and missile tests under kim jong-un who assumed leadership of north korea in late 2011 the nuclear program markedly accelerated kim has directed four nuclear tests and more than 100 missile tests far exceeding the number of trials conducted under his father and grandfather the test carried out on september 3rd 2017 was significantly larger experts say and could indicate that the country has developed much more powerful bomb making technology estimates from seismic activity led observers to conclude that the explosion likely exceeded 200 kilotons an explosion of such a size gives credence to the north's claims of having developed a hydrogen bomb in april 2018 chinese scientists reported that the strength of the blast had damaged part of north korea's pongi ri underground nuclear test site the following month north korea announced that it would close down the pundi retesting site because it had reached its nuclear goals pyongyang resumed its testing activity in may 2019 firing several new short-range projectiles observers say the tests were likely meant to convey kim's dissatisfaction over the breakdown of negotiations at hanoi but pyongyang picked testing back up in july including the underwater launch of a ballistic missile in october its first such test in three years as u.s talks remain stalled it has continued testing in 2020 there remain significant unknowns surrounding the accuracy of north korea's ballistic missiles expert observers have said that these missiles are usually inaccurate because of their reliance on early guidance systems acquired from the soviet union however some defectors and experts say north korea has begun using gps guidance similar to that of china's navigation system raising questions about the provenance of the system and whether north korea's arsenal of missiles is more accurate and reliable than previously believed have other countries aided north korea's nuclear program the program is predominantly indigenous but has received external assistance over the years moscow for instance assisted pyongyang's nuclear development from the late 1950s to the 1980s it helped build a nuclear research reactor and provided missile designs light water reactors and some nuclear fuel in the 1970s china and north korea cooperated on defense including on the development and production of ballistic missiles north korean scientists also benefited from academic exchanges with soviet and chinese counterparts though the exchanges may not have been explicitly tied to weapons development the information learned from research sharing and visits to nuclear facilities could have been applied to a militarized nuclear program according to joseph s bermudez jr an analyst of north korean defense and intelligence affairs pakistan also emerged as an important military collaborator with north korea in the 1970s bilateral nuclear assistance began when scientists from the two countries were both in iran working on ballistic missiles during the iran-iraq war 1980-1988 in the 1990s north korea acquired access to pakistani centrifuge technology and designs from scientist abdul kadir khan who had directed the militarization of pakistan's nuclear program pyongyang also received designs for a uranium warhead that pakistan had likely obtained from china in exchange pakistan received north korean missile technology it remains unclear whether khan acted directly or indirectly on the behalf of the pakistani government khan's multinational network also illicitly sold nuclear technology and material to buyers including iran and libya the nuclear know-how gained from pakistan likely enabled north korea to operate centrifuges and thereby pursue a uranium route to the bomb third parties have also facilitated pyongyang's program through the illicit shipment of metal components needed for centrifuge construction and nuclear weaponization north korea has developed covert networks for the procurement of technology materials and designs to boost its conventional and nuclear weapons programs since the 1960s these networks once primarily in europe have shifted to asia and africa and goods are often traded multiple times before reaching north korean hands says bermudez [Music]
