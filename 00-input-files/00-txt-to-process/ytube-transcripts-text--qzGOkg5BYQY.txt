hi my name is evelyn and this is my escape story from north korea [Music] before 2014 you don't have internet so how do you know what's happening in the world i don't know nothing nothing i have no information so now when you think about north korea what do you think about the people living in isolation like they have no internet i feel bad i feel really really bad because people have to know how the people different types of people are and their personality and then how the world is going on you know and like kim jong-un's what what they doing for it you know i feel so bad and they just when i was middle school there i i learned kim jong-un's and kimi songs like generation history i feel bad it's very wrong things to learn north korea is a special country for me because i had the opportunity to go to pyongyang in april 2017 just a month before all americans became permanently banned to visit due to the fact that i taught english in south korea for two years i have a good understanding of korean culture and i can speak the language which i used to my advantage during my four days north of the border all i can say is that i do have empathy for their struggles in isolation and evelyn is one of the very few that was able to escape and she did it when she was 15. my my house is never rich because my mom was business sir so she she worked hard for my family and she's supporting me a lot and i just escaped with my mom how did you escape i escaped north korea to china just the border when it was 2014 the river was present so we walked the frozen river what happens if when you're crossing the border into china if they catch you i go to jail and i heard some sometimes the soldier just shoot them like when the people are seeing it and they can shoot them that's the kim jong-un voice yeah i think that's crazy were you scared someone's gonna shoot you no we pay for soldier do you know how much it costs probably a couple hundred dollars that's it yeah that's it because my mom know him and we say we like him we will come back we will come back but of course you don't come back you cross into china and then what did you eat where did you sleep uh my mom she can speak in chinese very well she already had apartment there so we slept and eat there and um is it nice yeah it's very nice uh nice apartment after china i arrived the border of rouse and then we escaped i escaped again how did you cross the border with no passport um there's a bronco broker like broker oh a broker yeah broker pay him yeah we pay him like we pay we pay him and then we escape at night time it's like we walk a lot in the like a mountain were you scared i was scared of at that time and so after loud where did you go after loves i slept in hotel ross hotel like a day and early in the morning i went to um rouse to thailand border and like there's like small bots like only five people can sit so you went from north korea to china to laos to thailand with no passport yes and how many months does that take the whole trip one month one month and when you arrive in thailand what did you do um there's like two different parts you can go to south korea you can you can go to like america or japan england is there a south korean immigration immigration yes south korea yeah south korea immigration and from thailand i went to south korea incheon incheon airport first and then i switched the airplane to los angeles then chicago and denver colorado oh you lived in denver yeah i lived in denver colorado for how long for three years three years with my foster family american foster family there she attended high school learned english and became accustomed to american culture but as you might imagined it was very hard for evelyn to fit in her past was always on her mind did you know like why you were escaping or you don't know my mom asked me to go to america so i said like why i have to go to america and my mom say like a lot of people are going there for studies so like she said i should go there and oh yeah i was young so i say like yes i will go there but in north korea they tell you that america's bad place so what do you think about america when you were young i watched a lot of american movies in south korean movies like i have dream of american like life and i have dream of south korean life so they gave you american movies in north korea they don't keep me but i secretly watch it at home there's like usb thumbs driver yeah they put in there what was it like going to school in north korea like do you think they're brainwashing you um sometimes they're killed from front of people our school went there and then we have to watch that watch this um like protest because it's just an example of how we they're gonna treat us if we do this it was winter time the blood was like steaming and the skin was like fell out you know yeah what she's explaining is that her entire middle school class would go out in the field and watch people get shot in the head for nothing more than intimidation can you imagine seeing that when you tell americans that you're from north korea what do they say they're very interesting about it like they like all the people like question me same as like you yeah what was the hardest or most difficult part about leaving north korea and coming to america for my i used to live with my grandmother and i
