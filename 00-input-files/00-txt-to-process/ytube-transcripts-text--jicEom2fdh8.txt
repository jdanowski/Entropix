kim jong is a god in north korea imagine when god dies what people gonna do so in my theory that even kim jong-un dies right now i'm sure china will try their best to keep the status quo and replace somebody who can maintain the current system [Music] hi guys welcome to my channel my name is janmi park i am a north korean defector human rights activist so guys when it comes to north korea it is really hard to come with good news however today i have an amazing news for you guys uh so i don't know how many of you remember last year when kim jong was disappeared more than uh i think 40 days there were so many rumors that kim jong was in coma he was in a vegetable state he died even the kids body dog is walking around and the same thing happened again this year kim jong-un disappeared again for a long time now it's almost like it's been a month and of course there has been the same you know miscalculation i think last year even cnn broke the news that kim jong-un was in the coma however this year and later we found out that it wasn't actually kim jong had a really health problem so as i talked about in the last video he gained a incredible amount of weight in the last like seven eight years period he's over 330 pounds 150 kilograms and he's only 170 centimeters so he's not that even taller as a young guy he's been drinking they said even he sits down one night he can drink like 13 bottles of night in one evening he does not know how to stop drinking he doesn't know how to control himself so he's really unhealthy oily greasy food all the time i guess that's what you get right when you take everything away from 25 millions of people and you know when you're so greedy taking everything for yourself of course in some ways the universe is fair anyway the main point is that kim jong is facing another health problem last year there was a most likely he had a heart surgery and this year he's having the same symptoms maybe the surgery that last year he had thing going successfully and now he they are redoing the surgery or he's getting a new problem he got a diabetes his grandfather kim song died from heart attack from diabetes his father also died from heart attack from diabetes so most likely kim jong-un going to die from the same disease i really talked about last time why talking about kim jong-un's health is so important north korean regime is kim jong-un this country is kim jong-un so it's not like we are talking about some random present a leader of a country kim jong is a god in north korea imagine when god dies what people gonna do so that's why whenever we analyze north korea the one of the most important thing that we always talk about is kim jong-un's health and of course even kim jong dies right now that his son who was born in 2009 is gonna be too young to replace him his wife i mean north korea is not known to supporting women never had women rulers it's not i'm trying to become you know anything just talking about our history think about north korea guys hasn't gone through modernization so accepting women later is not a thing for north korean elites and even the general public it's not gonna even comprehend their thoughts they cannot be mapping their thoughts around having a woman leader and bow so kim jong-un's sister younger sister cannot replace him and his wife of course cannot and his mistress cannot and who is next in the line that doesn't really matter because whoever in the second line kim don't always eliminate them he always uh paranoid about someone you know collecting other power so when he as he killed his heart and uncle he always killed people next to him so we don't know anybody that is prominent who can replace kim jong at this point so in my theory that even kim jong-un dies right now i'm sure china will try their best to keep the status quo and replace somebody who can maintain the current system but then it's gonna be people who's not accepted the elite is not gonna accept that nobody is living like a human being under kim jong-un's ruling right now so if china's intention gonna try to maintain the status go it's not going to go well with the people and this is why it's exciting as i talked about last time the change can happen in north korea through internal reasons and external reasons internal reasons cannot be one revolution by the people second is kuteta third is assassinating kim jong-un fourth is kim jong-un died from his disease and the external reason is gonna be a word invasion from the usa japan south korea but i talked about why the usa south korea japan will never attack north korea because there is a lot of loss for them and also they don't really care about the people's human rights in north korea anyway there is no reason for them to ever go invade and kill himself but internal reasons i talked about why the revolution is a lot unlikely to coup just please see the previous video so most likely if changing i come from it's gotta happen when kim jong dies on his own because even assassination zone is impossible right now if kim jong dies that's when things are gonna be very exciting i think if kim jong dies before like within five years frame his next successor is very unstable his first son who was born in 2009 he's still like teenager and even though kim jong was replacing his father in his early twenties uh i don't think north korea is gonna be crazy enough to support a teenager right even though it is a kingdom it is still 21st century and i just hope that north korean elites still has a little bit of sanity not gonna do that if that's the case then what happens there is a vacuum in the power and i think that is gonna give opportunity for a coup to start or uprising to start usually revolution always come from the educated middle class who can afford the next meal i don't think anybody in the bottom who's gonna able to afford the revolution because they cannot even survive uh you know in the next tomorrow right their only goal in life is finding the next mirror so they can survive but the people in pyongyang is different the ten percent of population of north korea ninety percent of the people i don't think they're gonna even think that way but ten percent in pyongyang if this elites one difference if they wanna have human rights and freedom in their lives they can do something about it if those entire uh the controlling group demands something different i don't think china can even do that if without kim jong if china want to control the north korea the way it is right now then they really actually got to invade north korea with tanks but then the international company is going to get involved u.s gonna come in the south korea japan the allies are not coming then the world war iii starts so that's the best hope that let's hope we all pray that kim jong-un dies i cannot imagine that i ever wish upon a death on somebody but that means 25 million like lives only and i just really hope that maybe this is how the universe works i am very excited for my people and it's really amazing to see you know how kim jong-un is fascinating to see he's got this many scientists this many support this many resources supporting him to live forever but he's creating his own destruction by his own greed so thank you guys for helping me spread this amazing news with your friends hit
