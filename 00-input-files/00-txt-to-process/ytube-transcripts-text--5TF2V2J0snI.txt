[Music] many North Korean defectors who have managed to escape by traveling through China think of their secret of home country as a haunting place five particular spots within North Korea stand out to those who know about them for their propagandist nature and strange history the fake amusement park decaying and surreal among Gong de funfair is in North Korean amusement park almost exclusively meant to give visitors the wrong impression located 12 kilometers away from the capital Pyongyang in Mong Hyun Daegu yo a 70 hectare site includes a wading pool and fun fare with a rollercoaster merry-go-round and writeable mini Railway the roller coaster has been noted to be in a dangerous state of disrepair although it continues to be operated the park reportedly has almost no North Korean patronage the few North Koreans who do get to enjoy the park are bussed in when foreigners especially journalists visit the area foreign visitors themselves are kept inside their tour bus until enough of the locals can be transported to make the place look alive on top of that foreigners are given priority to get on the rides so that North Korea can put up a front of hospitality and cheerfulness the park is normally so empty and is in such a detrimental State that Kim jong-un himself criticized it heavily during a 2012 inspection he subsequently charged director of the general political bureau with restoring it to the standards of the military first or some goon ideology at North Korea Dara's yet to be any announcement or proof of improvement efforts to this day the fake amusement park sits there mostly abandoned mirroring the eerie feeling its country evokes the largest stadium in the world North Korea's room grotto made a stadium is paralleled by none allegedly capable of housing 150,000 people not only is the enormous structure impressive due to its size but it's isolated on an island within the nation's capital only two roads lead in and out of the area seemingly promising traffic jams interestingly the superfluous construction lies only a mile away from the 50,000 people Kim il-sung's stadium of ideals most unsettling part of the stadium maybe what it's used for rarely if ever are there any sports or entertainment events the massive building is almost exclusively used for propaganda and military parades aerial photographs showing incredibly well coordinated signs and drawings used to decorate the seating area are actually revealed upon closer inspection to view people holding up cardboard the number of people required for the creation of these masks choreographed images into the sort of intense propaganda and admiration of their leaders that North Korean citizens are subjected to while the secretive country bows to the world for 150,000 seating capacity at the stadium other sources have claimed the stadium hosts little under one hundred and fifteen thousand people it also been alleged that traitors to the state have been taken into the stadium to be paraded around and to never be seen again in particular a group of generals reportedly disappeared into the stadium after an alleged coup attempt smoke could be seen coming out of the stadium later that day fake propaganda town from the border of the two Koreas an outsider may be fooled into believing that the village of kete Jang dong looks like a typical cheery town complete with all the necessary facilities to sustain a society its uniform blue rooftop houses however if one could zoom in on the village the more haunting troops would become evident sitting in the demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas this village has been referred to as the propaganda village as the utterly uninhabited area was built to seem enticing to potential South Korean defectors the decoy reports 200 residents and tries to evoke an image of economic activity it's one of only two villages allowed to remain on the 4 kilometer zone set up at the end of the Korean War the other belongs to South Korea and just the actually populated Dae sung dung with only about 190 inhabitants Western experts and observers believe the ki Chong dong is ultimately a setup it appears it's buildings are unconvincing concrete shells without finishing such as windows electricity likely operates on a timer during the night to keep up the charade the only observed people in the village have been maintenance employees of the regime who clean the streets not only that but the village has been used by North Korea for petty showmanship of self-assign superiority in the 1980s the government at the southern country built a flagpole 98 metres tall in diesem dong which the North Korean government responded to by erecting an even taller 160 meter flagpole the incident has been referred to by some as the flagpole war both countries have engaged in this back and forth North Korea would blast loudspeakers as propaganda messages to praise the country's virtues while inviting southern farmers and soldiers to cross the border this does not create any South Korean defections so the north began broadcasting communists operas and marching music in addition to their messages South Korea also aired anti-north Korean messages in 2004 both nations came to an agreement to end these hostile broadcasts the fake propaganda village is surrounded by carefully kept agricultural fields that North Korea claims are part of the villages economy which is unknown who tends to these fields Hotel of doom one of the most unsettling and nonsensical constructions in North Korea may be the ryu-yan hotel the unfinished and most invisible marker in the Pyongyang skyline boasting 105 stories in 330 meters in height the skyscrapers name translates to capital of willows a historical name for the city plan for mixed-use and intended to be the world's tallest hotel by 1992 before the completion of the spire on Dubai's Rose tower the pyramid sits abandoned the tower currently holds the world record for being the tallest empty building on earth and was supposed to be finished for the celebration of Kim il-sung's 80th birthday it was a direct response to the completion of the Westin Stanford Hotel in Singapore by some young group a South Korean construction company in 1986 which was the tallest hotel in the world at the time North Korea expected to attract foreign investments through a newly established firm that would finance around 230 million dollars of the construction costs which was not achieved the North Korean firm plucked doomed Mountain architects and engineers broke ground in 1987 but had to interrupt their progress in 1992 due to the financial crisis caused by the fall of the Soviet Union the total cost of the construction was estimated to be 750 million dollars equivalent to 2% of the country's GDP Western media began circulating stories on the abandoned building calling it a hotel of doom and phantom hotel a crane sat unused rusting atop the building reminding all observers the ongoing failure the European Union Chamber of Commerce in Korea released a statement in the late 1990s claiming the elevator shaft were misaligned and that the hastily constructed structure was irreparable interestingly the North Korean government chose to pretend what the gigantic mistake was not there it edited official photographs to remove it and kept him out of official maps of Pyongyang 16 years went by before the Egyptian orosco group took up the continuation of the construction as part of a four hundred million dollar deal to build and run a 3G mobile network in 2008 North Korea claimed that the building would be finished by 2012 for the hundredth anniversary of the birth of Kim il-sung the world was surprised to see this claim materialized when it was announced that exterior work was completed in July of 2011 photos taken by Koryo tours were released in 2012 showing the interior however it had a little in terms of furniture and fixtures was given the concession to run the hotel starting in 2013 which was suspended in March of 2013 the building sat abandoned now seemingly finished until 2016 when Anna Roskam representative traveled to North Korea and work on the site was apparently restarted throughout 2017 and 2018 access roads were built and in April of 2019 an LED screen showing the flag of North Korea was placed at the top in July one side of the building was enhanced for the massive LED display shown North Korean film clips and animations finally in 2019 the hotel was fitted with signage setting the hotel's name in both Korean and English yet the massive construction reportedly has yet to host a visitor only hamburger restaurant in the country North Korea is one of the few countries unconquered by the McDonald's
