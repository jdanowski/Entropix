how scared do we need to be about North Korea's missiles Korea has fired an unidentified missile and mine are moving UN Security Council was condemned as outrageous North Korea's firing of a nuclear capable missile that could strike the US mainland in 2017 North Korea had its first successful test for long-range ballistic missile it was the first weapon North Korea could theoretically use to attack the United States and it turned a lot of heads with fury like the world has never seen so why so much fuss we're just one weapon well ballistic missiles are incredibly difficult to stop with some describing missile defense as being like hitting a bullet with another bullet and they move incredibly fast how fast well imagine North Korea had just launched a missile aimed any part of the Korean Peninsula I'll let you know when it lands [Music] [Music] long-range missiles are seriously complex weapons they're designed to fly in an arc for hundreds if not thousands of kilometers into the upper atmosphere reaching space before they reenter the earth and deliver a warhead to a target sometimes with an accuracy of just a few meters they have to balance themselves on takeoff withstand incredible stresses and know exactly where they're going the biggest challenge however is making sure the different components of the missiles such as the warhead and the fuel and the systems inside are balanced perfectly in order to fly correctly this was a big problem for North Korea since 2009 they had been trying to build long-range missiles by lengthening existing missile designs to fit more fuel and fly further but this didn't work the balance of these missiles was off and they spun out of control tearing themselves apart dozens of tests failed in this way with little progress made in solving this key problem until 2017 after three failed tests in April North Korea stunned the world when it managed to successfully fly across all 12 intermediate range ballistic missile on may 14th a weapon that could theoretically reach the US base on Guam two months later they improved their designs allowing these new missiles to potentially reach cities like San Francisco and Seattle by November of that year they had lighter airframes more powerful engines and better fuel systems North Korea now had a missile that could reach most if not all of America's major cities with a 500 kilogram warhead in under 30 minutes so what changed how did they go from nothing to a viable intercontinental ballistic missile in under a year I used to work in Russia in Ukraine and I know I've been to most of the missile manufacturing and so on there and I called some old friends attribution like planet this is where the engine was actually manufactured originally and there is some evidence from what they told me that some engines may have recently disappeared analysts have come to the conclusion that they had outside help and there are strong indications that these successful missiles are based on Soviet designs it wouldn't surprise me engine was transferred sometime in late 2016 we don't have no idea this 8a engines or 18 or 38 or 40 that is a very important item even though the capabilities are growing North Korea's missile force is still completely dwarfed but the United States huge arsenal and there's no evidence that they've been able to militarize their nuclear warheads enough to actually fit on one of these missiles but their missiles have done exactly what they needed to do they have made the option of any military action against North Korea the biggest danger to Kim Jong Un's regime a far riskier these tests have brought the United States to the negotiating table but a lasting deal between these two nuclear powers looks increasingly unlikely and that hypothetical missile we talked about at the start hits right about now
