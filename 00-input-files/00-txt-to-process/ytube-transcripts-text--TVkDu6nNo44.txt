so like funny guys are always like number one for me right right same as me yeah hello everyone hi hi so today are going to talk about dating culture with my friend jenny could you introduce yourself hi my name is jenny um i lived in america for most of my life i'm currently living in chicago we met in chicago i live in chicago only almost two years so i'm getting making new friends so all right let's talk about um our dating culture yeah so the differences maybe similarities between dating in north korea versus america america so i guess i evelyn what is your ideal man my idea man like more taller guy and then like fake not too much muscular man but like just a little bit right how about you um yeah i don't really know about appearance i think yeah definitely tall is pretty important i think most girls they prefer tall guys um i prefer guys who can be like a best friend type of type of relationship also someone who makes me laugh so like funny guys are always like number one for me right same as me yeah for me i'm looking for the like funny and very nice it makes me feel calm and like joyful when i hang out with him so that's my um probably favorite guy yeah um what is the first thing you notice when you meet a new guy i would say for me i noticed their eyes a lot and like their smile and overall like just the vibe and energy that they have um because a lot of people you can just tell a lot of by the first impression i feel like so yeah i think i noticed um like their eyes and like many eye contacts and then i go straight into like style yeah i noticed like guys style because i care about like dressing up and you know presenting yourself and i think people can express who they are more through their style and how they present themselves so is that american girls they're looking for more like that kind of way or what do you think i think we definitely live in a culture where we want to always impress the other you know regulators yeah so i think we always want to present ourselves the best way and especially for me i really care about like my own type of style and so then i i think that's why i noticed that a lot in the other in a guy right yeah for me um it's the same thing like when i made its first impression is very very important like eye contact also important because that way um i know how he's like nice and kind person or not and then i prefer how they um act like so maybe they open my doors but they don't have any mannerisms so they aren't happy but first time like they can they can try to open my doors yeah first time so it's it's kind of awkward when they open my door um the car doors for me but it is awkward for me but it's first time so at least i know he is nice to me yeah that's important yeah like at least he tries something for like man manners yes so that is important for sure okay um so this is kind of interesting how is physical contact and pda different in korean culture versus american culture because i think that's very different that is very difficult for um in north korea we don't have any physical country for the other person so we can no we can never ever do that in a public place i feel like very very embarrassing okay so you they'll be walking like a couple will be walking in the street or something you won't even know they're a couple they're not holding hands yeah they're kidnapped holding their hands oh wow it's very awkward and embarrassing for them yeah that's how north korean embarrassment looks like okay yeah everyone they don't hold the girlfriend or boyfriend's hands so they can now do like at nighttime they can but no one no one can see it because it's a dark like american culture i feel like physical contact and pda is such a like natural part of dating you know with the whole do you kiss on the first day do you sleep on the first date that type of thing is very um very open i say i see and yeah like i think people express themselves a lot through physical physical touch yeah and so you can you know definitely tell when someone is dating you know out in public i know when i come to in america i went to the high school uh three and a half years so i was so shocked i never seen this kind of like physical touches with the boyfriend girlfriend so they're kissing on public place and like holding the girl spot i was now i understand i never been south korea before so it was very like very weird for from there to like america it's like a whole different world four different words it's very opposite in when i live in north korea i never see couples holding their hands together and kissing someone or holding butt yeah oh my gosh yeah it's shocked for me and even they're younger than me like they're freshmen like they just got out of from middle school to high school they're uh freshmen you know yeah so what are i guess things that we appreciate while dating so evelyn had some examples like remembering small details about you or like helping you reach things from the top shelf like very like little things like that like what are the things that you appreciate um for me it's for like just another another things like when they're um with my boyfriend buying my stuff even they don't have to buy my stuff um they buy me clothes and you know something would i like to buy it they just fine for me and if you need it yeah if i need it and and i worry thank you for that and something if i need help with the like you know open the jar and then they can open for me yeah just another knitter things how about you i think for me i noticed this about myself but when i'm always like carrying something heavy or when i'm just like hearing a lot of stuff i'm not very good at asking for help and so i just kind of do it on my own i just feel like i can i can just do it but if if the guy just kind of comes in out of nowhere and just like helps me without really asking they just know that i need help i really appreciate that it's just i feel like that's very like oh i know thank you like thank you know i understand you're so like independent [Laughter] yeah like you know when when guys is there like with me all the time i just ask for help like can you open the jar for me like i don't know some reason like i can do by myself sometimes but my boyfriend or someone's there and i'll ask us maybe i have like opportunity to ask for help yeah so yeah it's just very weird yeah i'm very like on my own type of thing like i prefer to do things on my own sometimes when they when they're helping me out without really asking they just know that i need help and i just really appreciate it wow the next question is manners and chivalry yeah so um you know being chivalrous uh being like a gentleman i think that goes a long way and i think we're slowly losing that in the type of modern dating um well with the whole like women trying to be more independent um but i think you know when a gentleman you know have they have the manners they have the shivers like for example opening the door for you or you know little things like that i think you know letting letting the lady walk through first or what what do you think about like what kind of american men's have like gender gentlemen like habits i think the biggest thing is opening doors opening doors opening the door and then letting them through i think that's a very big thing i feel like even though a lot of people have that yeah like just in general that's like a very like common manner um but you just don't see it and ladies go first yeah always simply ladies and gentlemen first yeah very gentleman type of thing yeah what about you but sometimes the girls using the orders like i want to be first so that's why like oh ladies first kind of like make a fun of them oh yeah yeah like oh like i'm first yeah um but i i i tend to do that a lot too like whenever i go somewhere i open the door for other guys for other guys yeah i feel like i did that sometimes um sometimes like the guys feel kind of weird about it but i think it's just it's just nice to kind of you know just you know let them you know help them first well they're matters what do you think in like korean culture korean especially north korea um they don't they don't really have manners in those agreements because they don't know like other countries so yeah they don't have like that kind of habits like being being men or being like respectful to women and stuff yeah they don't have that kind of like special thing oh really yeah that's interesting so let me think about one um maybe maybe it's it's not like kind of manner it's just taken care of with girlfriends oh also like a girlfriend when you're dating or when you're i guess with someone like in a relationship right the guy takes responsibility for the for their life for their girlfriend right okay they don't have like responsibilities they're just like um for fun to like having dating with the some other years like that but in korea it's mostly serious relationship in north korea we don't have like um you know friends benefits like one night one day you know yeah dating like hang out you know yeah we don't have like that kind of stuff the if the men's really like the woman they just follow them like it's like stalking what really yeah that's like yeah when i was here when i was in high school in north korea um like a lot of men stopped me oh my god really yeah really they'll just follow you around yeah follow me around don't you feel uncomfortable um but it's our culture so so i feel like popular you know oh like it's supposed to be like seen in a good way yeah like oh they're interested in me yeah oh oh my god the stocking is totally different different different term like but they come to our house so like when we sleep they like they lock the door and then hey can i talk to evelyn and my grandmother said like emily's sleeping and i was so like curious what they want to say to me so i just go go i have to like talk to them like they said i really like you can i tell your boyfriend yeah that could never happen in america it's like like you can be sent to jail oh yeah okay on you right right oh that's so interesting yeah and then in north korea like the um bike is very popular right yeah really okay it's like the car we um driving every day so we ride a bike that's like the main transportation yeah that's main transportation and um there's like the seat in the back back seat oh okay in a bike so they sit on there yeah like when i when i try to go home they sit there and they're like oh can you get out it's too heavy for writing for you you know just like make fun of me and i enjoying that life too but like some song boys are very like psychopath really yeah really really um psychopath and they're kept asking and sometimes i get tired of him and um i i get really scared i guess that's like modern day like i guess that's or like at least in america like instagram dm people like random guys like instagram dmv like every day like even though you don't respond yeah it's like kind of like that i think i think replying to your stories um if your instagram is public yeah the tigers there's all these people that you've never met but they're just like you're beautiful like whatever like oh okay but that's that's more like in america because people can't follow each other that's weird that's right physically you can't be stalking them that's you can call it right it's just different cultures so oh that's interesting interesting but i have been um i'm enjoying that life at that time because like all the girls like you know some cursor they don't have um tensions so that's like i guess it's it's flattering it's a flattering type of culture culture type of like expression that's an expression of like i'm interested in you so that's pretty normal right okay they're kept asking until i say yes yeah that's very tiring but i have been like enjoying like i don't know some reason but like right now if someone doing like that and i have a very stressful time with it because i having very busy time like i'm working editing and making videos and this is too much time for like you know following them and talking to them like no no no like you know yeah that's how they should do too much oh my gosh wow okay all right so last question is turn ons and turn offs so i guess this is a term that something that girls like to talk about or even guys like in dating culture i'll turn on a turn off um so i guess like quick examples turn off so it'd be like bad breath or rude behavior right turn off and anger i think one of my biggest turnouts is like when they're really smart but they're kind of like humble about it they're not like very so like when a guy is like really cocky it's just such a turn off yeah i think when the guy's cocky and that's a big no we want a guy a little more nicer gentler more humble sweet like that kind of stuff all right all right guys thank you so much for watching our video yes it was really fun with you i learned a lot of new things me too and like see you guys next time oh make sure you subscribe my channel and a thumbs up for my video so
