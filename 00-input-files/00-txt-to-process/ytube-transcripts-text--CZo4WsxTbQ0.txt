if he doesn't do the one test he can feed every single one of north koreans for an entire year starvation is a torture it's the harshest form of torture is a starvation that is what he's doing he's torturing 25 millions of human beings on purpose so he can be a god in this 21st century everyone welcome to my channel my name is yami park i am a north skin de facto human rights activist so today thank you for choosing me to tell you what is happening inside north korea many news has happened and some of them were very shocking first news was that kim jong-un publicly admitted he rarely admits this but he did this time it was too hard to hide at least 10 million of north korean population so no out of 25 million uh is severely malnourished they're starving and dying from starvation in this 21st century kim jong-un acknowledging that in the international stage that was rare event but after doing that he internally declared the word against what do you think against k-pop he said anybody watch k-pop can result in the concentration camp political prison camp and even execution for watching a foreign information just mere k-pop is getting your life cared in north korea but this is also explains why the people are starving because kim jong-un is instead of thinking about feeling its population he's thinking about how to control people that's all they care about controlling people so now with this kind of the another famine began in north korea kim jong is busy catching people watching kpop and not only that kim jong un also announced that he's willing to go have a confrontation with the usa and also offer a dialogue and i will say why kim jong does this um so before we i talk about this on u.s relationship with north korea i want to unpack more on famine why nursing people are starving in this 21st century this famine is completely manmade kim jong even he was blaming the typhoon that happened last year but the thing is he can buy food he can import food that's the thing from 2017 till right now 2021 four years time north korea had conducted around 30 different missile tests long short mid-range and even hydrogen bomb tests so each time on average one missile test guides costs the money that he can feed entire 25 millions of people's food one year we do one test if he doesn't do the one test he can feed every single one of north koreans for an entire year so if during that four years he chose to cut down that spending in the military he could have fed every one of them but he didn't do that on purpose because for them for kim jong-un we are not even human beings it's much better for him easier for him to control us if we are on the starvation mode so we are weak all we can care about right now is being fed right but if that basin needs med then people are going to demand more things from the regime so it is so it is so painful to even say that like i mean so many people who went through rape myself went through rape nothing was worse than being starved nothing not even rape starvation is a torture it's the harshest form of torture is a starvation that is what he's doing he's torturing 25 millions of human beings on purpose so he can be a god in this 21st century that 30 missouri test didn't happen i mean even without that test kim jong-un has money to feed his people but he doesn't and now he's blaming the natural disaster and blaming the western sanctions that is what this is guy doing and with that kim jong-un now saying he's willing to having a confrontation with the u.s because he knows biden is so weak that he can bully him and also he won't have a dialogue which means we're like asking biden to give him uh you know the lift of sanctions and helping kim jong i just really hope that u.s doesn't getting into like well by this trick that kim jong is playing i just hope again the american president knows that they don't have to be bullied by kim jong this evil dictator in this world that if we cannot prevent 25 millions of human beings starvation who are we as even humanity right like why we are here fighting for animals rights all these people these old social justice warriors why nobody in this world not stunning of starvation of north korean people the torture of this humanity this is continuing and we have the power to talk about it at least and if we talk about human rights of north korean people if we do that then biden and any other government leader is going to listen to us that i think before we ask the politicians to care about human rights we have to care about that first because politicians are gonna do whatever gets them being voted and re-elected so can we start that dialogue right now i don't know why this news of starvation of 25 millions are making another more news kim jong-un admits that in the 90s north koreans like in the northern part 3 million died out of starvation he publicly admitting it is happening again in north korea that mass starvation of death is happening and this is not another major news in this world how come this is not a breaking and main story of news i know i feel frustrated but i know that you guys are the ones that unique people they care about human rights they care about oppressed people and know what is important in this world and knows also how much power that our voices have please share this news with you anybody you know so people understand what is happening to the north korean people and there's how we can change that is by talking about it by raising awareness so the politicians can act eventually i will do everything i can at this point to talk about it so hopefully biden gonna listen and gonna talk to kim jong-un about feeding his own people and stop doing this nonsense of threats to other countries and also i think at this point biden should not just keep getting bullied by kim jong-un and letting this dictator to play with him like this thank you guys for watching as always and if you really support what i do please join my patreon and i look forward to seeing you guys next time
