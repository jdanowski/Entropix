so in this video today we are going to be comparing female South Korean pop idols with North Korean pop idols the focus will be on the way each nationality present themselves in the music videos and the locations in which they are said in this will be a critical analysis so I'll try and go into as much detail as I can the female North Korean band I'll be using as an example for this video on the modem bong band whose members were personally selected by Kim jong-un their song is called tidal Yokohama Leto in English is called dash to the future and the South Korean girl band I'll be using as an example to compare with modem BOM are black pink formed by YG Entertainment the black pink song is one of their most popular songs of last year called kill this love already we can see the difference one is created by government be over by a corporation to start off with let's watch ten seconds of each music video [Music] we must kill [Music] okay so straight off the bat we can clearly see immense difference between the two groups one is incredibly formal and traditional whilst clearly lacking in money to make a sophisticated style of music video on the other hand one is obviously supported by a heavy industry which focuses a lot more on the creative aesthetic expression the band is trying to portray so first of all let's look at color and atmosphere the North Korean idol group is in what looks like a musical theatre or performance concert with very raw lighting the atmospheric colors are notoriously dull with the main colors standing out upon the idols if you look closely at the white uniforms you can also see red and blue clearly symbolizing that of the North Korean flag other symbols include the faces of supreme leaders and the communists are very much related to red and its origins in North Korean communism the usage of bubbles are about as Western as this girl group will get so far in the background they are surrounded by other musicians many of which are likely to be soldiers or high-ranking officials within the North Korean government so we're already we know that this North Korean girl group is very much in association with government and politics even those observing in the crowds who look similar to those already upon stage meaning that not only is this girl group an asset of a political agenda but they are associated with our elite a few in particularly male government officials and whilst it is hard to see if you look closely many of those around the idols are showing suppressed emotion which reveals that the whole performance is purely symbolic of something deserving of respect in this case the ideology of juichi right in the back we can see moving cinematic panel images of clouds which is directly connected to the aesthetics of something hopeful and glorious to which only North Korean viewers would truly understand as this band is not targeted for a non North Korean audience now on to South Korea's idol group which is vibrant in all colors well lit and so obviously aesthetically creative each idol gets individual representation within various studio settings which rely heavily upon artificial materials and CGI the random uniqueness of each setting also helps black/pink separate their music video and presentation from every other kpop music video which also does the exact same thing unlike the north korean girl group black pink do not represent any monolithic idea especially nothing political individualism can be more clearly observed with each Idol embracing various creative art forms as their celebrity fanbase status is highly emphasized within South Korean society and like with most kpop videos only the idols are represented within the music video no one else is involved which plays a role in separating them from the average South Korean further elevating their idol status we do however see background dancers towards the end of the music video however their faces are deliberately blocked from clear viewing whilst North Korea's girl group is more focused on the inclusion of the people within the political messaging South Korea's girl group is more focused on the celebrity making the idols look flawless eye catching and limitless [Applause] [Music] within the Moran bong performance we can see that all the women and even all the men are wearing the same uniforms this is typical of Orthodox communist societies and how they express ideas of equality the idols are essentially fervor pushing the narrative and setting the standard for society to follow from what I've read this is a sexy and beautiful look for North Korean women in a country that upholds very formal fashion standards the uniforms themselves are very reflective of military uniforms further establishing the point that the girl group is an asset of both the North Korean government and military the uniforms also reflect a rejection for Western cultural standards of fashion and promote a positive image of North Korean women within the North Korean army much of this will also be a fantasy for the North Korean male elite if we look closely at the faces of the North Korean idols we can see that they are wearing makeup to lighten their skin highlight their eyes and to contour their faces we can even see the drastic difference in skin tone when observing this still image not to mention that none of the idols have plastic surgery as it is banned in North Korea the hairstyles are all more or less the same as a result of North Korea having limited hairstyle choices for both men and women from a Western perspective this is perceived as old and outdated but from a North Korean point of view the idols and merely upholding beauty standards which rejects all forms of modern foreign influence and are encouraging for the North Korean youth to embrace them the idols themselves seem relatively healthy and well nourished which suggests they are part of the Pyongyang elite and benefit from the privileges of being closely associated with the government when we observe black pink and how they express beauty in fashion we see the complete mirror opposite first of all all throughout the entire music video the idols are constantly changing outfits into clothes that reflect nothing of what the average South Korean wears further solidifying their rich celebrity status and distinguishing them from the general public the fashion in particular is very sexually provocative revealing far more skin than anything we saw in modern balm given that South Korea is a far more feminist society in comparison to North Korea the exposure to more of the idols body also further sets the ideal standard for the South Korean female body type ultimately the portrayal of fashion is clearly an embracive reflection of diverse Western fashion standards if we look at this Idol here who I believe is known as Lisa originally from Thailand is embracing a look that is incredibly racially ambiguous from her hair colors to her hair style we can see the intercultural foreign influence which is trying to appeal to new fashion trends and to a multicultural audience you will notice that within our kpop music videos idols will often indirectly or directly take upon Eurasian beauty standards which makes them stand out amongst the racially homogeneous society certain black pink idols may have also had plastic surgery however they are not the best k-pop group to use as an example whilst the beauty and fashion standards of Morton bong were starred deliberately to be inclusive to the audience the fashion and beauty standard seen within black pink are deliberately made to be unincluded to make you want what you don't have whilst Madan bong perpetuates the standards of so-called communist equality black pink and many other k-pop groups perpetuate the standards of capitalism and the retail industry a South Korean cosmetic fashion and plastic surgery industries are upheld largely in South Korean society k-pop idols in general ultimately become a part of the greater advertising machine that keeps setting the standards and keeps the money flowing all while supplementing South Korea's media industry South Korea's global influence and the overall South Korean economy trends catch on quickly within South Korea as it is a collective Confucian based society the way k-pop idols present themselves is definitely not overlooked North Korea on the other hand has no capitalism and therefore has no means of promoting beauty and fashion in such a way [Music] of course the clearest distinction between the two girl groups is namely that of the dancing the dancing of Moran bong comes off as almost stale in comparison to modern forms of dancing it's the type of dancing and singing you expect to see in the mid twentieth century there is not much movement in the body especially in the hips and neck which is sustained in form for most of the dancing duration whilst most of the movement comes from the arms and legs again it's a clear rejection of Western modern and foreign cultural norms and I imagine North Korea has very high standards for what they would consider too hyper sexual the music itself has more in common with traditional Korean trot music which probably directly descends from colonial forms of trot music which rallied for the liberation of Korea from imperialist Japanese rule in the early 20th century [Music] the instruments used our fusion based but with a clear emphasis on the classical instruments this is done to show that North Korean society is well taught and professional in the fields of music Walden bong also sings exclusively in Korean even showing the Korean alphabet for the lyrics the English translation of the song is also deeply patriotic and humbling for North Korean nationalism as it attempts to manipulate the audience's emotion towards everything related to country and a ruling party black/pink on the other hand is modernized and westernized in all forms completely the dancing first of all involves a lot more body movement and showing off of flexibility which from a North Korean perspective would be to sexually corrupting for society to observe the music has more in common with American pop music which descends from 90s American pop the singing itself is more heavily Americanized with a lot of English used in the lyrics to make the band seem internationally exclusive and to encourage a South Korean audience to study and learn English you could also argue that if this entire song was sung in English most people with no knowledge of the band would simply assume it's American pop music like most Western songs the lyrics uphold the strong emotions of love and the struggles of containing emotions an attempt to make association with common daily struggles which predominately young female viewers could relate to you can also clearly distinguish various forms of singing styles throughout the entire song and the music is predominantly electronically based visual instruments are not used to enhance the performance of black pink as again the focus is on how they look move and become expressions of art in media the modem bong banned are almost nearly unspoken of I could find a few articles talking about them from the perception of which they are unknown and mysterious but not much is greatly known about them as the internet and media are largely suppressed in North Korea black pink however is everywhere and not only can I find information about upcoming albums and tours but I can search into the personal lives of each individual idol member if I desire to become a obsessive fan whilst the modern bong ban is clearly upholding the North Korean values of preservation and traditionalism black pink is used to express the values of globalization capitalism and materialism the modern bong ban present themselves only truly for a North Korean audience as the political messaging is empowering of North Korean hegemony and sovereignty the band also presents themselves as being a part of something North Koreans should strive to become or already be a part of black pink present themselves in the complete opposite way to show themselves as something you are not and are unlikely to become because you don't have as much money as that therefore as a result you will desire to be closely related to the idols through means of possessing materials that can enhance your looks and perception of course not everyone will act in such a way but the subliminal messaging is still there and people may indirectly by particular beauty or fashion products as a part of their subconscious desires whilst Madan bong is directly in line with the ideology of Jiu Qi one could argue that black pink is in line with the ideology of neoliberalism which helped create environments for capitalism to flourish trust me if you go to Seoul not only will you see advertising everywhere but the image of k-pop idols is largely incorporated into it you
