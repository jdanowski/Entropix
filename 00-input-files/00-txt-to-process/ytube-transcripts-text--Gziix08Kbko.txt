welcome to north korea unpacked [Music] she's the only woman in north korea who wears a brooches and only she's allowed to rock the above-the-knee skirt length and now some of you may think that it could possibly be the leader kim jong-un sister kim jong but this exceptional woman is the regime's first lady these hurt you now before we get into details of this fashionista let's do some fact check about lisa 2 one born in 1989 she's presumed to be around 31 early two she married kim jong-un in 2009 so only just when she was 20 or 21 three before marrying kim jong-un she was once a singer for a popular north korean musical act known as the inhaso orchestra [Music] so she actually visited south korea as a cheering team for the asian athletics championships in 2005 here in incheon four she's reportedly a mother of two sons and one daughter and not much information has been released about the two sons but about that one daughter a kim jong-un known to be one of the best friends that told guardians in an interview when he visited north korea eight years ago he held their daughter and five she's known to be a big fan of luxury items like designer bags well at least it looks like she is and apparently she's the regime's [Music] trendsetter [Music] considering access to luxury items is super limited in the regime she sure seems to be influential enough to set fashion trends plus a north korean woman don't wear accessories like hers because for instance brooches draw attention to an area just over the heart where the past leaders faces should be so thus violating the regime's socialist and conservative ideology plus her skirts are falling just above her knee is shorter than what the comedy state allows which says a lot about her exceptional status the 31 year old elisa is not only a fashion leader but she's also an active supporter of her husband on the political stage now she's become the first north korean first lady to accompany a leader to official occasions like his 2018 summit with south korean president moon jae that's when she showed off her witty cute personality like sharing jokes with the president her feminine image also helped the regime soften its perception at home and abroad so for instance kim jong-un sent lisa zhu to deliver gifts of school supplies to orphanages once a singer turned into a first lady who is now a fashion icon as well as a caring loving figure these are two has some quite good impressions really softening that rigid and dry image of the regime if you like this video subscribe to this channel and give us a thumbs up thanks for watching [Music] you
