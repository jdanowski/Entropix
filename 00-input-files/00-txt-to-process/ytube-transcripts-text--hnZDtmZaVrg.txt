[Music] though they try to keep up appearances North Korea is known as a politically backward country with no personal freedoms or rights the international community treats North Korea like a pariah and it only has diplomatic relations with a handful of countries around the world because of its totalitarian government there are numerous restrictive laws today we are looking at things you can't do in North Korea in North Korea three generations of totalitarian leaders have ruled since the advent of the Kim dynasty these rulers are referred to as Dear Leader and promote the idea that they were divinely chosen for their position thus it is extremely taboo to disrespect any of these leaders and the punishments are harsh they even go beyond capital punishment one of the country's most brutal laws is the three generations of punishment rule if one person is convicted of a serious crime and sent to a prison camp their immediate family can also be sent with them then their next two generations born in the camps can also remain there the edict was introduced in 1972 by kim ill sung and said up to three generations had to be punished to wipe out the seed of class enemies Kim il-sung who founded the country and died in 1994 is often called eternal president or great general Kim Jong Il his chairman or dear leader Kim jong-un who took power after his father passed away in late 2011 may be called supreme leader or dear respected one journalist who failed to add a title was quickly scolded please remember the leader always remember the leader all North Koreans were a pin over their left breast featuring the face of Kim il-sung or Kim jong-il or both the pins can't be bought by foreigners the most common one as a shining red flag with the two men's portraits but don't call them pins that word undermines their significance as one minder said after consulting translation software on his phone they are badges although the North Korean Constitution officially allows freedom of religion the practice is very different the state has a hostile approach to religions particularly those it seizes Western faiths such as Christianity the nation's official ideology is Juche a fusion of Marxism and Korean nationalism created by Kim il-sung and the regime views any practices outside this doctrine with deep suspicion those discovered practicing Christianity face arrests and being sent to a labor camp as such Christians are forced to worship in secret and some don't initiate their children into the religion due to the risks historically Korea had a large Christian population missionaries were active throughout the Korean Peninsula when it was a Japanese colony prior to the Second World War and around a fifth of its population was believed to be Christian as many as 500,000 of North Korea's current 2.5 million population are estimated to still be Christian today America and North Korea have a prickly relationship they allowed very limited travel for a period of decades that all changed in 2017 when North Korea made American tourists illegal this followed the imprisonment and murder of American college student otto warmbier in 2016 Juan dia was scheduled to undertake a study abroad program in Hong Kong in early 2016 and decided to visit North Korea on route over the new year period he booked a tour of North Korea with young pioneer tours a China based budget tour operator whose slogan is destinations your mother would rather you stayed away from warm beers father fred said that young pioneer advertised the trip as safe for US citizens and that otto was curious about their culture he wanted to meet the people of North Korea but things went awry and warmbier was arrested before he left the country he was struck in the head and returned to the United States in a body bag few North Koreans have enough money to take a leisure trip but even if they could they are limited to North Korea the government realizes that as soon as their citizens leave the country they're liable to run away though North Korea has limited relations with China North Korean citizens are not even allowed to visit their next-door neighbor [Music] when the UN Security Council imposed sanctions against North Korea in October 2006 following the country's first nuclear test among other measures the body placed an embargo on the provision sales or transfer of luxury goods to or from North Korea the embargo targeted the country's political and military elites seeking to impair the opulent lifestyle they enjoyed as the result of President Kim Jong Un's patronage and ultimately to create pressure on the country's leader to obtain sanctions relief by curtailing the North Korean nuclear and related missile programs but officially luxury goods like sports cars and jewelry are all forbidden in North Korea though of course the Kim family has numerous exceptions the North Korean government pursues illicit avenues to satiate the appetites of its top leaders continue to develop Pyongyang's weapons programs obtain currency and strengthen the elites allegiance to the Kim regime one such way the Kim jong-un regime achieves these aims is through the acquisition of luxury goods high-end items such as caviar wine liquor jewellery and automobiles are acquired through third party countries to fulfill Kim's passion for luxury goods and bribe the upper echelon of North Korean leadership to maintain their loyalty to the Kim regime North Korean elites have no trouble acquiring these goods as long as they have the money to purchase them the international community has become increasingly aware of the DPRK surprisingly easy access to these goods as well as the regime's dependence upon these items to maintain stability and further its political objectives men and women in the Hermit state have reportedly been given an illustrated guide of approved hairstyles which have been deemed acceptable by tyrant leader Kim jong-un

added owning real estate is strictly forbidden in North Korea in fact private enterprise of any kind is officially banned in the Hermit Kingdom those court face arbitrary punishment even though the black market remains one of the only ways for people to get the food medicine and other necessities the government often fails to provide in reality officials will often turn a blind eye in return for bribes in recent years Kim jong-un has reportedly allowed an increasing amount of unofficial private enterprise in areas such as mining retain the operations are still the property of the state this unofficial economic liberalisation has helped North Korea's GDP grow although it remains only around two percent of that of South Korea's Apple products and other Western tech companies are officially banned in North Korea but like virtually every other law in the country exceptions are made for the elite in one of the many staged photographs of Kim jong-un the leader of North Korea appears seated at a desk beside what looks like an iMac computer her fondness for Apple products among North Korean elites wouldn't come as a complete surprise in 2015 researchers from Germany took a look at red

dollars euros Japanese yen and Chinese yuan have long lubricated the isolated countries struggling economy which has endured further blows from international sanctions imposed in 2017 and earlier this year to punish the regime for nuclear tests and missile launches under its illicit arms program the foreign notes offer currency stability and a means for the regime to enhance its coffers in a country whose native bills North Korean Won are relatively worthless and only used by ordinary citizens for everyday transactions inside the country birth control is banned in the country as dictator Kim jong-un strives to create a bigger population of socialist workers but businessman and officials on trips to neighboring China are bringing back condoms to give as presents smugglers are also
