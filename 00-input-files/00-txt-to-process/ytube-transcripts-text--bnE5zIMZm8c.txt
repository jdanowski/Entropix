hello I'm a VX so I can wonder it's interesting trends I've seen in 2019 minecraft is the rise of so-called hole of service this is where they take a map of the entirety of the Minecraft uploaded onto a minecraft server and then use the townie plug-in to notonly simulate the entire earth but also to simulate the various political structures that come along with that it basically means people can simulate and run their own countries in Minecraft and one of the most fascinating servers is the very biggest one of their type because of just how much has been done here today we're gonna be checking out the biggest hole of political minecraft server of course others are available and I do recommend checking one of those out but today a lot of people have asked me to see other parts of this exact same server because as you can see this is the dynamic map for the server is really built the entire earth inside minecraft it's fascinating to see because you can click and see where all of the players are but also all of the political structures like this is Poland we walked across at last time in fact we went across a lot of Europe last time so I think it'd be kind of fun to check out some North American cities today as well as of course the Koreas is North Korea really the best Korea will find out in this minecraft server and then perhaps there might be fun to check out one of the more risky areas of the world and go to Syria perhaps we're going to go into a lot of strange places today and checking out the server in that particular way so before we get started while I'm here in New York which is where I left off last time I feel like there's something I need to mention because whenever I play any minecraft server there's this big debate mister should you play you know servers and a minecraft channel knowing that perhaps some people will drain the server as a result and I wanted to get the message off my chest right here right now and say that I spoke to the admin the admin seems all on board there I spoke full of the community and the community seems to be on board whit for the most part because people love seeing their countries and their favorite pasta server shown off but there are also people who believe and kind of like the whole like censorship thing of like you know these things should not be public you should never share this sort of stuff with the world because it's our little secret but my personal philosophy on this is if something is public then it's available for anyone to see right whether you want to tell your friends whatever you want to tell you know a lot of people on the internet if you want to make it private you can totally do that but this server is very deliberately public it thrives of having a huge P&C and that is a good thing to some extent No the only downside that has ever really stated is the fact that of course you know this server only has a limited number of players that can be on at a time and sometimes it comes close to that max which means there's a queue off at that point so if there is a queue please do not join the server this is my request to you right now that is the one negative effect only join if there is space for you to immediately join so if you are looking to join us server I recommend joining one value but earthen sea is the biggest one the one we're playing on and checking out today but you can build one of these things from scratch you can build your own new york city if you really want to now we've gone that off the way let's check out this server because I'm really excited to see what the community has built another thing I'd like to mention because I think it's kind of funny is that the roads between the constants the ice roads have been seriously improved since last time look how nice this ice where it is between Europe and Africa I believe it is and they've even got this low headquarters building where they maintain the roads I mean a little bit concerning having a giant red flag I'm just saying when you see the communist symbolism it's a bit of a red flag okay that's that's the worst show let's get out there let's head to the South maybe wait no I want to head west I went ahead across America before we head to Africa as fun as Africa is gonna be we got up we got to stay focused today okay that was fun but I'm gonna try and stay on track today and we're gonna check out some big US cities starting with Chicago because looking at the map you can see how the u.s. is surprisingly like the real-life version of it where it's super super spread out there are very few settlements across there the slides on the coast but there are some big exceptions to that both in Illinois and in Texas maybe even check out both but Chicago is a pretty big city as you can see right here we've got what I assume is the loop and a few of places kind of set up here well this is Plainfield at er√§ Coit settlement but yeah we're gonna be checking out a little bit of Chicago which apparently is 9 Illinois it's in Kansas according to that server because I guess Kansas went and conquered it maybe that's very confusing oh it should be worth noting because this server you know kind of starts from scratch there's a lot of things you know modern political structures that aren't here and you know the US as a whole concept isn't a thing instead it's lots of different nations such as Kansas which invaded Chicago and is now building one of the biggest cities in America so I guess that's the thing that you can check out but yeah this is Chicago which if I'm not mistaken is the third biggest city by population in the u.s. that's a pretty interesting city because it's like so different climate wise to the rest of the real world and it's also like super skyscraper II and it's also got this very distinct vibe because whereas New York is a very international finance city and whereas LA is like the city of celebrities and it's very international otherwise Chicago has a little bit of that but it's also got this very fun american filled sweat you know mixed in there to which i think it's a you know really interesting thing this city also for what it's worth a Chicago has one of the highest murder rates for gun and gun violence but it's mostly you know in places just outside Chicago so as long as you stand the city bounce you should be safe I've just left the city bounds and those noises immediately alert me that I am NOT safe but I want to check out the Iroquois nation to the west a little bit so let's head over there now so yeah I definitely am here in Plainfield Iroquois and it's a nice place because they have themselves lots of their you know glass greenhouses I always want to call them just greenhouses I mean I they are green in terms of what's inside but they're glass you know they're transparent that's their color and yeah the the settlement as a whole it's a nice break from the city I guess it's kind of like the suburbs where instead of being just giant skyscrapers it's just these nice little you know like little towns and settlements and little houses going around here so let's check out some of these because this is a house that belongs to someone with very interesting tastes you know I I actually quite like the black on red like I personally I'm a big fan of like seeing different minecraft builds I don't like her filming the same but I felt like a lot of people would question the black concrete powder walls with the red stained glass and the orange terracotta maybe it's concrete and then there's green nicolas terracotta for the things this is a beautiful house you know at first that was torn on this but this is the best house I've ever seen in Minecraft and yeah they just live in the suburbs of Chicago so I guess yeah this place is such a nice little feel of like a small American town despite being literally on the outskirts of Chicago at least in games I know it's a bit further away in real life but it's even got this nice little roller coaster that's gone of those giant barns you see on TV or maybe in real life if you live near a giant barn in America and yeah you know I like this Plainfield place a lot you know maybe I'm not cut out for that city life maybe I should live out here in the suburbs but yeah the thing that makes these service beautiful is the banks that every single you know little civilization every single town you know for the townie plug in but every single nation every single city every single town every single any collection of players seems to have some common goal for what they want to build where it's a giant city where it's some giant walls whether it's some whatever and the fact that all of these players exist side by side sometimes peacefully sometimes not so much river you know you might have seen some frets in the chair yeah you know to what's on like hey you don't pay I'm going to invade you you declared war for nothing because you're not a very nice person are you laughs a on YouTube I don't I don't know if that's one of the allowed words but you know you know that's that's what they said I'm just quoting them and you can see how the trance always super spirited in that way because it's a lot of people existing in their own little bubbles having their great little towns and cities and you know things like this and building you know as a collector but then also being able to fight for each other I think it's fascinating that this whole earth kind of experiment proves something that we see in the real world all the time they're one of the best ways to unify people is to divide them against each other unified people in amazing ways amongst themselves and thereby you know making them fight of people which is the whole reason we have tribes begin with right like I don't really like people but if I was going to die if I didn't have a friend to defend me or if I wouldn't defend a friend then you know I you better believe I would be a fan of the tribe system by the way right now I'm heading across the rural United States there are very few villages and settlements between Chicago and Texas which is very what ahead next right now I'm somewhere near st. Louis which by the way one of my favorite American cities that I've been to but st. Louis in the game seems to be nothingness this is literally you know all there is of that that's roughly where I'm at when I to get to Texas you can see how it's like just all of this space right here there's like a few tiny supplements of one house one guy just living by himself in a bunker and then there's pretty much nothing else all the way until I get to Austin Texas or to Dallas or to College Station question mark oh I was wrong about st. Louis being nothing I think if I'm not mistaken there is something here just a few weird alternate American stealth flags I like it they felt like a giant version of their own banner it makes the banner seems so much more official when there's a giant wool version of it I really like this as a building idea by the way if you're gonna make a custom flag for your nation we're by the way which has a Congress and the Supreme Court very temporary I can see it's kind of cool to have like that next to that like for any flag I think that really adds some legitimacy to it but yeah right now st. Louis is just a very temporary little place and everything else we're gonna see along the way is gonna be similarly temporary I do believe and the good news is because we're in just the wild areas the PvP zones the wilderness between towns is actually fairly easy for us to break blocks although lopes serve lag means it might take some time there we go man the moment I get on the road it turns out it's the very end of it like this is a huge road going through the forest and then it takes a right turn which is not the direction I need to be heading so more forests for me I guess Oh as it turns out I was slightly wrong about there being nothing between you know Chicago and Texas you know third fourth bigger cities etc but as she turns out there is Kansas City you know the thing which owned Chicago which I think is you know kind of funny by itself but yeah Kansas City is here and it's actually pretty nice it's what I imagined Kansas City is like in real life fun fact did you know Kansas City is not actually in Kansas I bet you didn't know that it's in st. Louis or its inner in Missouri for the most part like there is a Kansas City in Kansas but it's smaller than the Kansas City that's not in Kansas which I think is beautiful and maybe you did too but yeah it's kind of funny that you know in the same way at the server you nights around these towns and cities whether it be Kansas or whether it be Austin or ever it be wherever this is is this also Kansas City maybe this is the Kansas Kansas City no actually maybe that's the Kansas one whatever you get the point but um yeah you can see how just over here wait I've checked on a map this is Oh laughs Kansas which has a different mayor to the other one I oh yes so you can see Kansas City has a four huger variety of players look at that whereas you know Kansas Oh laughs Kansas is a much smaller place it's it's more quaint and whatnot Oh even got these fun little skywalk where's I love seeing these in cities like I think Minneapolis whereas the most um but like any city which has walkways between buildings in the sky is a city that I am a fan of and would love to visit but ya know it's funny because in the same way people can unite and divide around the cities and towns and countries in game it's also a funny thing where you can see there's a big division between like is it cool when people come check out the server there's all people think yeah like it's an opportunity to show the build to have more you know players or whatever and some people say no actually I like the current number of players people have already joined they're the best people get out of here new players obviously ignoring the fact that people you know need to join to keep the server life because slowly people die often you know like any people want a server that's alive just not to a life they want you know certain number of people in the server as a whole but not too many and to some extent this is you know can again it's a fun reminder off you know any country but let's just say the US as a whole where you can be like oh yeah people much prefer people from their own town or state as a whole but also there's a big you know love debate as to like should more peep or join the country as a whole should we have a lot of people here or should we have way fewer people here there's a you know that debate is always running at the same time in real life and it kind of replicates I love that I'm over here like basically the I love that I'm over here apparently given people some weird analogy to immigration this as far as I can tell based on the the vigor and the you know the the the angriness of some of the you know people based net because you know it's good enough right now why does it need to change why does it need to grow or get bigger or better or whatever and I love you know the fact that the server on it wants that that's not important the server owner you know is should be subjected to what the people want and maybe the people don't like that and I love that you see these factions and debates go down I love there are a lot of people like actually I love seeing new people who think the same way as us joining this same place I again I I don't know where this will goes but I think it's fascinating speaking of fascinating during my little walk across you know America right here there has been a surprising number of like oh yeah look here's a fun little desert saloon II looking town you know it seems as though there's no big cities and there are no big cities between the two big ones but there are lots of you know small little outposts and settlements of one person or two people and yeah I think that's kind of cool because that does reflect how I guess the u.s. this as a whole like there's nothing big but there are lots of school towns that people you know enjoy living in and yeah I've recommend totally in a getting myself like this even though there are teepee options and we use those for going huge distances sometimes I do recommend going for a little walk across a server like this because you know that's how you explore the earth right I guess not by walking I usually I explore the earth by taking a train or plane or something but still usually you're you're traveling across it you get a sense for the scale of it like I've said this before and it might be offensive but like for instance if you teleported me instantly from the UK in real life to New Zealand in real life I'm not sure I would believe that they will opposite enter the globe like maybe a low bear part maybe it's another European country like mulch or something but uh yeah I wouldn't believe that they were so far apart but when you see everything in-between like I've done between Chicago and Texas here you'd start to appreciate and understand things at least a little bit more so here we are we are in by the way Houston Texas which if I'm not mistaken is definitely the fourth biggest city sometimes its fifth sometimes it's verged you know let's just say very big city in continental United States is that acceptable and yeah it's funny because they've got this little welcoming dude oh no he's a human trafficking victim that's I thought he was here to welcome me but he's like I have very mixed emotions should I should I think that's cute or should I think this is terrible I I genuinely don't know but I think that's beautiful but yeah this is a republic of the Rio Grande in case you're curious which apparently is a little faction here so this if I'm not mistaken is the Houston like I'm not sure where any of these flags are but yeah this one looks a little bit Middle East II right so just now I killed myself so I could get my hunger back and while I was doing so I noticed that the channel at the chat now has three separate channels there's a Chinese Channel in a Russian channel as well as a trade one which makes me think there's a whole bunch of Chinese players and maybe Russian players on the server and then this is the polite way of saying not Chinese or Russian but you know it's for trading which is why you use English oh wait no wait maybe that is a beautiful thing because English is the international language of business so maybe you do business and if you yeah Russian or Chinese speaker you gotta learn English if you want to trade that gold or diamonds of other players I guess okay so maybe you know I'm just saying this maybe I'm the bad one for nursing this but does this building look like yeah you don't never mind this this is this is beautiful right maybe is what is this design I mean having the balcony there makes me think that it's not an it's just a happy coincidence or a sad coincidence but I'm just I'm very cautious of this building but like we should go inside oh man I might be trapped at it claims to be the City Hall and I mean it seems very serious on the inside there's even a museum on the third floor which I have to go see this let's see the Museum of Houston cuz if you look over there they actually have their own disparate way if this is a you know community of people so serious they've got like projects they work on a little disc called servo just for you know the Houston on this one server which I think it's kind of cool well yeah let's let's go check out the Museum of Houston Texas in the server oh this wait third floor American system means second floor British system you know I did I miss it was that was that the museum one of the funny differences between you know American flooring and British flooring is we have ground and then we go one two three but I think in America one is the ground Fleur so is this to know that this would be 2 and therefore this is definitely free which I mean where's my museum is the museum a lie is that just like a is that click this I feel click baited by this you know I I feel like I was lied to and I did not get my museum in the end there is a nice little balcony here though I'm just saying I have my concerns about how legitimately this thing was built but you know let's move on from those because the risk the city looks pretty good as well look at this church over here it's a pretty nice Church I mean fits what I vaguely know about the south of the u.s. look at that giant water building that's a pretty spoke suite build hadn't they even do that actually is the water under the glass or on the outside oh it should blue glass I am literally it is that actually blue glass I should make something out blue glass I've learned from this I can this this stuff is also kind of cool because you get to get some inspiration but yeah Houston Texas nice little place there's other cities in Texas I'd love to check out same with the real world but yeah for now this one's pretty solid oh I should mention Bo I'm going to Houston fairly soon I'm really excited about it because I haven't ever been to Texas there's a lot of like Texas only things in the US that I've always wanted to check out also ring the bell wait wait wait no this is a perk of June see make sure if you're watching this video yeah ring the bell see I'm a youtuber now cuz I'm promoting myself and making making it more likely that you see my future videos cuz that's that's how you survive as a youtuber so thank you to anyone who has subscribed and ironically and devorah who's ironically subscribed you're not you count just as much so it's funny because from here in Houston you know if you don't know here's where it is on the map of the US as a whole from here in Houston it's way easier for us to go to looks like you know Mexico down here and oh that's the Rio Grande but it's easier for us to go to certain Mexican cities unless Rio Grande is a Mexican city you know like I'm not too sure what's going on here but it's easy for us to go to these major Mexican cities than it is for us to go all the way west to see you know Lake Tahoe or to see Mount bridge or Irene want to see Salt Lake City in game cuz I I learned in history class that Salt Lake City's on a natural Salt Lake but I still never believed it so I'm gonna have to say in Minecraft before it seemed real to me unless maybe they just aren't any Mormons playing minecraft and no one fought to build it because there's Las Vegas so this should be Salt Lake right but this is new Kanaan the Grand Canyon which is somewhere near Salt Lake maybe okay so in direct contradiction of what I said previously I'm gonna teleport a little bit west so I can get a feel but what the Grand Canyon area looks like because I didn't notice it you know didn't like pop my head cuz I just didn't assume but if you look right here you can see how like oh yeah this whole area everything around here besides the strip is actually owned by the Grand Canyon Grand Canyon Grand Canyon all of this stuff is on but all of this stuff besides this one here which is owned by Deseret Deseret I'm not mistaken is like a Mormon Bible term for Salt Lake or maybe it's like the the holy place I'm not entirely sure but I think this might be Salt Lake City which I mean it's never really a Salt Lake nor a city which is kind of sad so yeah we're gonna head west from here I'm gonna teleport a dog to the Grand Canyon we're gonna look at it in real life we're gonna look at it in Minecraft because I've always wanted to look at it in real life but I mean fun fact I don't live anywhere near the Grand Canyon and I mean there aren't really any major cities near it that you know like besides like Phoenix and maybe Las Vegas that are easy to get to from Europe so I guess we're gonna have to settle for the Minecraft version oh actually is this is this the canyon here I'm not sure if this is but this is a beautiful Mesa biome I know it's like moderate arraign or like not what it but like custom terrain but like this is beautiful stuff this inspires me to like go to a Mesa biome and make my own Grand Canyon almost I mean it'd be a lot of effort but if it looks anywhere near as good as this it'd be beautiful right there's even this giant railway which takes you up the mountain maybe to get a better view again this air like I love that like even within this same you know region of the world even within the US you can see just how diverse the biomes are you know it like real-life biomes not even not even minecraft biomes fun factually a lot of Minecraft biomes are based on past the US the Bryce makes a price poem based on the Bryce Canyon I want to say the mushroom biome is a real place in the US and same with them make it Slugger that's like a little few places that look like that I thought that was more when I learned that maybe you do too I also think it's well that there's just a dude who lives out here way outside of the city in the Grand Canyon Elvis is at the train station norm lives here actually I like to imagine there's a dude role playing as a homeless person on the Grand Canyon train station I I like to believe that actually no I don't like to believe that that makes me sad so yeah you can also see sing advanced have a job addition feature because these are always Java servers there you know having maps on the floor this is really cool to see we can see the entire area like super zoomed in although actually you can see how this exact same view we can get on the world map just like this because here we are anyway like here's the train station here's the surrounding area but I mean like it's still cool to see it in the game this is a fun bit of inspiration also this is the end of the road and that's the other end this is a really short rail track like I mean maybe they're gonna expand maybe it used to go further it's like Amtrak where like I used to cover the whole country and now just kind of covers some of it sometimes question mark but yeah super interesting to see regardless yes fun fact there she is there they used to be so much more train service across America because the country thought that the best way to stay together the best way to bring trade across the entire constant was the railroad it was the big thing in Europe at the time and yes so the Transcontinental Railroad was one of the biggest like moments in American history and I studied it in school in case you're curious as to why I know random things about American railroads but yet it's interesting that like at one point now was fought to be the way to connect America and therefore there's a lot of cities which had rail stations now lot on the do because you know it was kind of a pipe dream you can also see it go the of when a few places such as Denver I think used to have a rail station and then it's not really used for Amtrak anymore but then they used as like the basis of their light rail system it's a really beautiful station you should check out in real life I would check it out in Minecraft if it existed I decided to check and yeah it seems like it doesn't exist this Colorado Springs here and there's some unplaned town to the north I don't know why it's unclaimed does it meant to be a Colorado it it's owned by a man called trash man John so big I guess there's that there is some form of Colorado here but it's not particular big which is why we're gonna continue our journey westward till we hit the west coast by the way I found somewhere that looks a little bit full out seat because there's a town somewhere in Nevada maybe the worships the holy TMC and I mean they were part of Nevada though a nutri that's where a lot of third nuclear testing went on so maybe they this is a radiated little town that worships a piece of TNT I'm not sure how easy it is for Wars to happen where that could perhaps blow up but I'm just saying putting TNC inside your city is even the best move or the worst move it's either a power play or it's literally the opposite of that and I really don't know which if there's one thing I've learned from the internet it's that if we all raid area 51 together they can't stop us and by we oh I mean literally just me so clearly this will go really well I'm actually curious like is area 51 represented in any real way because if you look on the map you can see how there is something area 51 looking all the way up here EPIK area 51 there is some form of area 51 let's see if they can stop me going in actually is there anything just stopping me doing it the NOI by just joining like that oh the doors are not opens everyone asked the mayor and assistant to join so even though I know about half the server is very you know torn on to ever youtubers their thing I'm gonna ask many ones to try it going to area 51 I've got a fake name set up so that people don't ask are you the real so I can't as you can see I'm not like at the most which I think is the best name you can be right like is that there else like at or is it a fake toy cat it's faux fur at the same time okay I don't wanna I don't know fuel any conspiracy theories but it's a little suspicious that there's a giant red beam coming from roughly where area 51 is the place I can't get into and a place which is surrounded by giant walls on all sides although they made the mistake of thinking a single block or two blocks and then a cobblestone wall is enough to stop you gang in which doesn't work when you're going across walls like this because all I have to do is jump on the side like this and look at this I've snuck into area 51 let's see what it's like here don't go to area 51 they're throwing beldo fiends bath water at you ah that explain what this is welcome to area 51 all intruders will be shot on sight they've even got some suspicious lights that just kind of cycle on and off just for the fun of it alright I like this place actually there is a real err 51 that someone built I'm pretty sure it's one person based on this someone just decided to build this but the question is what's in the underground part of the base am I gonna find aliens or is it just more the bathwater again I mean before I wasn't sure if it was intentional but this definitely is intentional right there's no way that's not designed to be with that is it is this what they're hiding in area 51 is this really what all the commotion is about oh wait I found a never portal here - but it's just another giant hole question yeah this is really confusing there's just a giant hole in the never that connects up to area 51 maybe this is what the US government has really found or maybe it's this other secret tunnel there's lots of secret tunnels and secret tunnels and this area 51 place it's just a tunnel going down to bedrock why why is this a thing I really don't know wait it's kind of strange because the same portal that I went in drew in area 51 ended up over here also sunsets still Mary 51 one step ahead of you the portal ended up in Fresno which if I'm not mistaken as a Californian city somewhere near LA maybe minutes in between LA and San Francisco but still we end up in Fresno which is a bit of a weird outcome I've always fought by the way if there is something really secret air 51 it's not gonna you know the very top end stop isn't gonna be stored there because that's where people know to look for it the really top end stuff is in some random place that looks like it's a mountain on a map but there's actually a giant military base or something like that you know if North Korea can do it so can you know the United States of America they're not hiding their biggest secrets the place just north of a major metropolis no you know air 51 probably has some secret you know f51 fighter jet designs are some you know like nonsense technology like that but it doesn't have a Lian's or stuff like that that's gonna be Oh San Franciscan Oakland this way let's go check it out I like San Francisco now here's the deal I really like California in a lot of different ways but prices are not one of them and also space is like not one of them even like the San Francisco in particular it's literally a peninsula it's surrounded on three sides by water and yeah it's so small for the millions of people that live there wait I've worked it out this must be a hospital that's that's just a plus with some extra extremities on it Wow look how good care they take of their people up here in middle California although this road which leads directly into a river might contradict that a bit I mean maybe for these cars driving to a river maybe that's why they need a giant hospital next door it's funny this is almost like the answers the question like what would it be like if California was invented in medieval times and I guess they'd have huge castle walls and stuff like that you're like a big moat to stop people getting in maybe I think actually that giant bridge I just went under might have been Golden Gate Bridge I guess it's a lot smaller because this is one to one kilometer scale so what is meant to be you know free four five kilometers maybe is just like four blocks but let's go back let's check out what San Francisco's about because I think I missed the door so yeah there's a huge mining operation to the north here I actually like the way they've done these mines like a little bit intimidating but also kind of beautiful at the same way and they've got enough red concrete to make them look cool and then San Francisco appears to be nothing whereas Oakland which is the main part of the city you can see there's a board here official notice from the governor for Oakland any all unauthorized bridge buildings are so that's very California it's even like an executive order and and regulations to stop you doing things like that but yeah you can see how like oh yeah look at this there's a there's a big old city where's this the same town from earlier oh god damn it totally is there's a horse inside is it a horse hospital - maybe but yeah that is San Francisco this one road that leads into a big river is San Francisco that's kind of sad so yeah we've we've gone from East Coast to middle coast there's no coast in the middle so to Texas to area 51 it's a California but you know we could end the video that we like this was a nice tour of North America but I want to go further I want to go deeper I want to see what it's like in Syria so I'm gonna find a town in the Middle East that will let me join I know very confusing reverse scenario here okay the closest place I could find or at least like major place that they would be fun to walk from was Bucharest which is the capital of Romania if you don't know it's also right next to this giant city turn of Oh in Bulgaria which is roughly where Sofia should be so yeah we've got Romania we've got Bulgaria and then we'll walk through Turkey it looks like Constantinople sorry we're walking for a Constantinople definitely not Instanbul or Byzantium if you want to call it that and then from there we can finally make our way into Syria wait I forgot Turkey exists generally I thought like oh yeah you go straight from you know but Bulgaria right into the Middle East now you we got across Turkey as well and then we can hit Damascus in Syria it's gonna be a fun walk I hope it's worth while like in real life the Romanians are nice friendly people it seems and we've even got a giant grand castle that you get to born in so yeah this is super interesting like the style of the architecture is entirely changed along with a flag along with everything else as we've gone from North America which even though it was very different there was something keeping it together here everything's just wildly different it looks like we're in like a forest town and yeah we're sadly just gonna head right out to Bulgaria I don't have to look at the map to see which way south is cuz I know that's the Bulgarian flag or just I'm pretty sure it'll be embarrassing if I'm wrong but we can find out from the comments right but no I'm pretty sure that's the Bulgarian black white green and you know red notably not using the pan-slavic colors of white blue and red and yeah we're gonna head right into Bulgaria which has a big old doorway just me to walk in through if there was any doubt there's this sign saying bill is protected by Bulgaria and then a smiley face a heart and another smiley face but yeah look how different the style of the builds is here in Bulgaria and potentially you know it's a shame that last week we missed out South Eastern Europe because there's a lot of cool cities there and apparently that transfers right into Minecraft earth so just outside Bob Garrett there's this giant submarine which I really want to go check out but again we've got a mission to be on and that is a mission to head to Syria Jesus Constantinople is beautiful I mean you know I see why people say you know not Istanbul Constantinople if it really looked like this although actually wait I thought this was just a chunk not loading it correctly I mean I'm no expert and medieval building styles but I just feel like that's not how castles look actually wait it looks kind of questioning I see it more I really want to build something like this now like a floating giant thing it just seems a bit too big for me so if you don't know one of the things that makes Constantinople so power for one of the reasons it's one of the center it's the biggest city in Europe if you count the Asian side which is a funny sentence to save but the reason it's such a big city the reason it's so important is because it controls all of the you know power influence trade off the Black Sea which then controls with Russia so it's a very important part of the world for trade routes and for all those sorts of things and yeah there's a very big city on both sides of the river one of the biggest I've seen actually in this service so far look there's even a giant statue on top of that joints either way though I'm just here because I'm trying to go through the river think Justin gets caressed by the way there's Bucharest there's Bulgaria here constantinople one of the biggest cities on the server and then we're gonna head all the way around that through some of the Greek islands and I guess over to Cyprus along the way - or Nicosia which belongs to Turkey family man there is something so nice about taking a long boat ride watching the Sun Rise having that minecraft music perfectly play here I think one of the things I love about this server concept is no matter how much or little you know about the server you can always navigate it you can always understand the scale of the distance you're traveling which is something that's a lot harder to appreciate a regular minecraft world because the biomes start to blend together after a while after a while but you know seeing this giant church and a random Creek Island seeing all of this stuff it doesn't blend together the distance I'm traveling feels real and it makes it actually fun to do a distance this big anyway the Sun is rising I'm hoping we're gonna find Cyprus soon honestly I think one of the things that makes the world as a whole beautiful is knowing there's only so much out there unlike the universe which expands infinitely you know that you could theoretically explore the earth or at least explore every country at some point explore every major city in every country if you tried hard enough knowing that it's moving grasp even if you don't grasp it is something that's beautiful and that's something that's not true for the infinite worlds of Minecraft that's why I've always loved the limited worlds that consoles to have the old star world that we've used for various minecraft server experiments the reason I love all these sorts of things is because you understand the limits of it and everything everything makes more sense within a finite world where when you have a limited amount of so there's some random French in the chat but when you have a limited amount of something you appreciate it much I think something that can help you understand the limits of any resource be it time be it money be it physical space in the world is understanding limits off it like you will not have infinite money in your life when you are in X amount a year it doesn't just last for that year it has to last over so much longer time understanding the limitless of money is what can make you so much better with understanding the limits of the world can make you appreciate what's going on more so yeah we're on Cypress now it literally is just Turkish on which is probably offensive to the real world but whatever that's fine and yeah it's just it's fascinating to me the understanding that something is smaller can make it seem bigger but it's it's true right like if you think about 157 million dollars what does that really mean if you think about the fact that in your lifetime you learn 4.3 million dollars every single dollar counts more than in that mystical world and in that way 4.3 million would seem like far more than 157 million at some point when you just add numbers you get past the point of human comprehension because not all humans are numbers people and I guess even people who are numbers people don't necessarily go all the way on that sense or so yeah it seems like though nicosia is just a giant castle I guess they invaded Cyprus though a castle here and then figured you know it's our territory now no one really wants to live in an island enough nowhere which is a shame in my opinion but yeah this is Cyprus what a lovely little random island on the way to the Middle East by the way I have no idea how this is possible but I've genuinely lost my boat I put it down here I'm pretty sure and now it's gone the fact that there's someone in a boat rowing away from me does make me very suspicious that maybe they took my pub so I guess what we have to do is head across the island onto this little bridge over to Byzantium I might have done something very rude to get a boat I might have realized that part of this fortress was out here in the neutral zone and I figured you know is Turkey gonna miss one of their little boat pillars anyway I'm sorry Turkey um I'll give it back as soon as I can I'll be back here very soon fixing your wood things I mean it's not as if anyone's even gonna notice this right like these are faux wrap the waters enough ones anyway in fact I'm gonna go ahead and guess that someone's done this before is this guy coming to kill me or is he a friendly um maybe I should take his boat yeah that's my that's my genius idea here oh god oh god he wants to kill me okay the good news here is I can get away see I I was right though see I did a bad thing but I allowed me to escape someone doing a bad thing to me this is one of the beauties of like human morality well like you know it's bad to steal but if someone tries to kill you it's probably okay to steal from them right I'm not sure if that's actually true I just know I have a boat now and that no one can kill me and that's all that matters so what we're now gonna do to make sure we can't be chased is the same thing we did to start the video we're gonna hide ourselves on the map so that people can't do the thing I hit so I can't in Turkey yeah that'd go okay that guy was coming to kill me I I nailed that interaction I think you'll find well says this my previous boat there's a lot of randoms and invokes here in the Turkish see the Greek see oh wow look at this see it again Middle East very different architecture style there's a British flag here there's a giant ship but then it's very sandstone II kind of like a desert village by the way the server has some form of leveling system and I just lowered up my acrobatics by taking damage which was totally intentional that's that's why I took the damage that's why I fell four blocks instead of three it's because I'm a super genius who wants to level up my acrobatic skill of course but no yeah looking at these errors right here the parts of Byzantium it's either really beautiful or really ugly and I can't walk out which like everything here looks like it was blown up at some point recently but maybe that's just how the terrain is or maybe it is like deliberate they're working on something there are big projects in the start of being made right now by then this is 100% surviving on the server which is why seeing some of these things are so impressive just in case you didn't know probably should always clarify that like when it comes to Minecraft obviously there are some things that are in creative but 99% of what's interesting about Minecraft to me is survival and seeing what people can do in it and this is a grand exam like even in this fairly remote parser but there are still giant builds of various different things I guess I should say survival Asterix by the way because you can buy resources using gold and stuff in survival there is a currency which makes it somewhat easy to build things but still not easy I wouldn't say okay now that I'm fairly far away I'm gonna show myself on the map and we're gonna get a peek as to where we actually are at this point in time because I think I'm somewhere near Damascus yeah I went a little bit too far ended up in this thing here we've gotta head to the north now and then we can check out Damascus Syria and all the people who decided you know I could live anywhere in the world in my Minecraft world but I choose to live in Syria like Syria was supposedly you know quite beautiful quite an interesting place before the big Civil War these days however one of the few places on earth that is literally an active war zone you know like I I'm just saying maybe that's why they want to build in Minecraft show the beauty of it or maybe there's some giant like Civil War joke in all of this maybe maybe this is really the Isis faction on the server I don't know for sure and so we check it out so yeah we're now in Damascus with Emperor Supercat if as the owner it seems and yeah maybe I think there may live just made joke about how it's been bombed like there is nothing here besides one greenhouse and a lot of plots where people could build but haven't really done much there maybe you've got grief maybe someone was like you know it'd be funny if we bomb Syria I that is possible look at that giant castle over there this is the ugliest big cast I've seen but I also think it's kind of beautiful at the same time because of how ugly it is because that's that's how complex tastes work but no yet looking around the rest of this we can see that Syria all of it or at least Damascus Syria has like a couple of nice builds and then a lot of destroyed builds around it like this is really cool don't get me wrong but it seems to be the only thing around her oh this isn't even pop Syria this is Paul Meier Palmyra it seems oh look it's where this guy seems to be from so offer a little adventure in the Middle East there's one more place I feel obliged to check out today and that has to be the Koreas you can see they've even built a giant Korean flag as what is the soul so it's just a giant Korean flag we have to know which is better is it South Korea or is it the better Korea with Pyongyang it's actually funny that looks similarly-sized on the map yeah we'll see we'll check out Busan head north to Seoul and then we can check out Pyongyang so I guess apparently you can head to sell but not to Busan which is kind of odd to me so this is what Seoul is which I guess is what that the base for people who are working on the giant Korean flag again you got to give some credit to that no matter how much no matter how you know like no matter how many blocks you were given it would still be very hard to make a giant Korean flag and oh it's not just the joint Korean flag it's a giant cream flag covering the city there is a whole city down here with a big thing like that up there that's really cool honestly I do sometimes wonder when we go to the spacefaring age whether we use space to travel between points on the earth or when we go to the moon regularly or Mars or whatever when enough people start seeing the Earth from outer space there's gonna be a country or a city that uses like you know that it's a few to do something really cool like a Korean flag or like anything like that and I think that's I think that's even really scary already wonderful I don't know which but yeah this is beautiful this is an amazing bill like this curved dome thing that it's all built in because you could just build a flag that floats in the sky but the fact that it looks like it really could exist that way and be supported by love this I think that's what makes this amazing so yeah South Korea is one of the most stunning places on the server heading north from here even there's even more it's not just a town hall and a giant Korean flag we've got some other big skyscraper blocks which match we'd expect from a Korean city I guess wait my bad this is chungju a city just the south of us so again really cool the career is this well-developed again kind of matches what you imagine in the real world right like oh yeah look at that you see big cities because South Korea is one of the fastest like industrializing and like speeding up in terms of GDP corrupt nations it's one of the Asian Tigers if I'm not mistaken and yeah you can see looking around this place it's not only super beautiful skyscrapers and super nice flags but also cool little you know olden style palaces but like in in Korean style but you know I'm not here just to gawk at this although actually that's in title I'm here I'm here to check out the rest of Seoul oh look there's even a nice pathway going through a giant building so you can be like hey yeah I'm just here see the giant ice pathway it's a shame I don't have my boat anymore you can tell this is a relation city because we've got giant guru next to the road I mean that if that's not proof that this is what this is then I don't know what it's but ya know you can see there's a lot nicer outskirts the city oh and there's some leftover boats here okay this will take me the entirely wrong way but I have to see it regardless what does all of this packed ice look like when you're going along it packed ice speeds oh you can even go through the DMZ border to get to North Korea via ice boat now that is Korean efficiency if either the heard of it oh god all of the signs to help you know where to get on or off this giant ice pathway are in Korean which again it's a nice touch but it really doesn't help look at where I've gotta go is it that way I mean maybe Oh pump Pohang that's not Pyongyang but it sounds close enough wait let's ride our boat into the water stream see what happens there I'm honestly not sure how this interaction works Oh floats up that's seriously cool I have no idea how I just did this but I ended up in queen king queen I I don't know how to say Q's in Chinese cities I think it's King but I've ended up up here in hyeseon when I wanted to be down there in Pyongyang I don't know how I made a mistake this severe but both pathways will do that to you I guess so let's head south instead maybe oh they use the old Manchurian Flags the ones that's got like five colors on because it's meant to represent five different it's one of the cooler flags in my opinion in terms of what it represents but yeah it's also one of the ugliest flags in terms of what it represents when you look at it okay this time I'm crossing the DMZ on foot my plan is you know like realistically speaking they can't police the whole forest an actual fun fact about most borders is although there are you know the most common places that people cross on foot are easy enough to patrol and stop people going across the truth is most countries have borders so vast that they can't reasonably patrol them all so if you want to cross a border very illegally to drug or you know like legal purposes then I guess pro tip is fine like a super vague niche route and like tribe all the way out there trend alter a suspicious on the way to the border and then you can probably cross it quite easily again it's like it's like the us-canada border for example it's so long and you can't patrol the whole thing you can just patrol the most major parts of it and probably same with South Korean North Korea even though it's one of the most heavily militarized borders in the world there has to be some secret way of it because you always hear about people defecting from North Korea to China and somehow people get across the north-south border they never tell you how because then the the border loophole be closed but you know they get across somehow despite it being very heavily armed so yeah illegal immigration with toy cat yes that's a new series on the channel that were mixing in with the earth series but um yeah more seriously I'm actually a little bit lost I think that's Pyongyang though oh yeah you better believe it your boy is made it to Pyongyang capital of the North Korean Republic or sorry they called the Democratic People's Republic of Korea the most democratic country they're so democratic that instead of having a bit of tea and tea they have something so much nicer it's a giant missile in the center of town because you know what you need to see you need to see the might of your country every single day on the way to work speaking up about nice North Korean flag I actually really like this one I think the the regional flags aren't so great but this is really wonderful it's even paved with emeralds have you ever seen a pavement made of emeralds you probably haven't it's wonderful to see that here capital of Pyongyang and North Korea look how great this builders I think this is wonderful there's even there's you know this this city right here might be the best thing I've ever seen in any minecraft server sure the people live in wooden huts and have to you know farm off the the grounds like this sure you know they're they're literally farming people with no food but the you know the capital is made from a giant missile and emeralds but on the other hand looks kind of cool bright on the other hand sends a message to the world that you shouldn't mess of North Korea and isn't that the only message we really need to send that was a rhetorical question of course because the answer is yes that is the only message we need to send so yeah this is North Korea but inside minecraft I think it was beautiful and I think actually everything we've seen today has been really great you know showing off Europe it's there I know best because I live in Europe and I've seen most European countries but it's pretty cool to see places that you can't see or haven't seen in real life I will probably never go to North Korea until the regime Falls but it's cool to see regardless North Korea here in Minecraft even if it's of weird representation South Korea never been was wonderful all of the American random wilderness I explored through that was really cool to see too and yeah it goes to show the community of players that make this possible is a really great thing again I would recommend if there's a cute do not join the server I won't even link it down below just in case that is a thing and that I recommend finding a server like this or finding even just a crew friends to play with so because again together you can sometimes do amazing things segregating yourself is not usually recommended but it is a tip that might yield you some great results and yeah maybe that's a positive message sent maybe it's not even wait I hope you all enjoyed today's video like it if you did like it share it if you really liked it and tell notifications if you want to see more videos covering weird minecraft builds and salves love cuz I love seeing what people do in Minecraft and this was no exception big thank you to the earth MC community for having me for today and yeah yes thank you to will be able to build these wonderful things and yeah I guess thank you to the admin for inviting me on and to expanding the server and to doing all these sorts of things and just a reminder 20 players who are upset about any influx is that this is mostly a problem of intellect I guess server maintenance or whatever like this server has been expanded in many separate times the only question is like is that expanded enough and I guess you can support the server you think what the server needs is more money or you can not support the server if you think that it's a way to get money of you that's the decision you can make with anything in life but I think censorship is the way forward but you know maybe I'm crazy maybe I'm not even wait I hope you all enjoyed this video you can like it if you did like it you can share if you liked it my skin looks so bad on Java I realize I said all that stuff already but man look at this skin it is rough anyway yeah goodbye [Music] you
