North Korea is not a joke it's one of the worst countries in the world it's isolated it's dangerous it's strict but above all it's depressing so here is my time inside North Korea I visited North Korea by taking a 24 hour train from Beijing to the border here you can only enter as part of an organized tool and I will have to take a train it's not great for 24 hours and the minute you cross the border you enter a whole new world of soldiers will inspect everything you own to check every picture and every page of every book that you have they make sure you don't carry any Bibles or currents or any religious texts because religion is banned no political books no nude magazines no internet transmitters and no sensitive information soldiers even take your phone to check which pictures you have and it all makes sense because this country is like a prison inside of it you'll see extreme poverty and extreme isolation with no freedom no Wi-Fi no Facebook no access to the outside world this place is such a closed community that everything that produced is produced internally which means there's no trade or very little trade with other nations and no matter how much they try to hide it North Korea is poor on the highway there are very few cars because people can't afford them this is the main highway of North Korea inside homes there is no stable power because it keeps going out power went up again outside homes poverty is apparent and the people are trapped inside hi hi what do you want to say the camera they have a beautiful culture beautiful traditions amazing sports events circuses and dances they are proud people but the problem is they don't matter what matters in North Korea is the missile the tank the soldiers the fake illusion of power military displays are everywhere in the country and leaders are on every buildings this is what the country chose to focus on at every cost and not this [Music] my time in North Korea only lasted five days and it was orchestrated to see what the government wants you to see and on my train out of the country I got checked one last time by soldiers we just got you checked luckily they didn't steal our videos and as soon as we were in the clear I cried I cried for the people there there is no solution for the average North Korean their country is and will remain a prison one day it may be as prosperous as its neighbor South Korea but that day is very far from today see you next week [Music]
