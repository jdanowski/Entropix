fake propaganda village that nations build to impress foreigners although it could have been used throughout history it was first recorded to have been employed by grigori potemkin in 1787 in a bid to impress his former lover queen catherine ii grigory potemkin was made the governor of crimea after the russian annexation of the region he was tasked to rebuild and develop the land after some time the queen decided to visit the newly conquered territories to familiarize herself with those lands and to impress the ambassador she took with her grigori was put in a difficult position as the land was heavily ravaged by war the queen and her company were expecting something majestic while crimea at the time was the opposite to solve that problem it was long believed that gregory created phony structures along the banks of the nipah river while the queen was traveling on a barge down the nipper it was said that gregory would hastily build temporary fake structures complete with fake peasants to inhabit them just before visitors would arrive at a particular location when they would pass on from that area gregory's men would disassemble the village and facades and rebuild them downstream during the night while more recent historians doubt the accuracy of this particular story there's little doubt that it speaks to a deeper truth that governments often want to project more power than they really have potemkin villages have often been created specifically when a government wanted to show something off that wasn't available anywhere in its territories or to any of its population the idea was to make people believe that the country was doing better than it actually was north korea has always struggled to maintain its image to the world the nation was divided into two after the korean war ended in 1953 the populations of both south and north korea were never divided by heart though as they still considered each other as brothers and sisters they were just forcibly divided just like east and west germany finally united in 1990 these korean populations looked forward to their own unification this posed a significant threat to the north korean regime particularly after its economic growth began to lag significantly behind that of the south in the early 1970s while most people in north korea lived with only basic amenities many south koreans had lifestyles that surpassed even some western countries in luxury north korea also went through a fair number of famines and most of the country's population was severely malnourished all of these challenges along with the fact that many koreans did not mind being united to become one nation posed a serious threat to the authoritarian north korean regime as the north korean government continued to struggle through the 1980s and particularly after the fall of the soviet union in 1991 increasing numbers of north koreans attempted to defect to the south even though north korea called for korean unification under its regime people from both the north and south of korea seem to be more willing to unify under the protection and government system of the south rather than the oppressive north korean leadership north korea as a highly censored nation tried to hide the true extent of its problems so no one knew what was truly happening inside the country this is what set the stage for the north korean potemkin village kijongdong the village was built within sighting range of the korean demilitarized zone when the korean peninsula divided into two in 1953 it was one of the two villages that were permitted to remain within the four kilometer wide dmz due to its proximity to the border and the fact that it could be seen from the south korean side of the dmz it became a display of north korean propaganda this potemkin fake village was built by the north korean founder the first eternal leader kim il-sung who ruled the nation until his death in 1994. the village was maintained by his successor kim jong-il until his death in 2011 and today by kim jong-un it was given facilities that most villages in north korea lacked renovated extensively to make it look like north koreans were living in luxury and comfort according to the north korean official statement the village had a collective farm that the local population maintained another statement which was released in 1991 said that there were 200 families living there at the time there were no official statements after 1991 so we don't know if the number is increased or decreased there was a child care center a kindergarten a primary and secondary school and a hospital the village was made to look like a true communist heaven with people working together on the state resources while they received every facility from the north korean regime in return there are still multi-storied buildings in the village that at least for a time appeared to be in excellent condition they were painted in bright colors that were easy on the eyes and provided with electricity and other modern amenities the most striking feature of the village was a tall 160 meter flagpole that hoisted the north korean flag it was built in the 1980s and was the tallest flagpole in the world until 2010. it was constructed in response to the south korean flagpole across the border in this flagpole war north korea constructed an even bigger flagpole than the one built by south korea while it looked all shiny and beautiful with casual observation everything was artificial when observed with advanced telescopes and cameras the houses did not have any window glass they were simply empty shells of concrete most buildings didn't seem to even have interior rooms or floors the lights were simply turned on in the buildings to make them seem inhabited artificial activities were performed in the streets of the village to give an illusion of busy life called the peace village by the north koreans it earned the nickname propaganda village by the south koreans the village was meant to show the north korean utopia state to both south koreans and visitors from throughout the world and also to the north korean visitors to the dmz kijongdong was also a hot spot for loudspeaker warfare both nations broadcasted propaganda on loudspeakers to induce defections from the other side north korean loudspeakers used to ask south korean soldiers and civilians alike to defect to north korea after broadcasting how blessed life really was in north korea very few defected from the south compared to those from the north national marching music and anti-western speeches formed the loudspeaker propaganda of north korea despite all these efforts people from north and south korea alike knew that just 20 years after kijongdong's construction that north korea was rapidly falling behind in its competition against the south kijongdong is just one example of the facade that north korea employed to maintain a little bit of self-image this facade continues to this day even though now the visitors to the dmz can see right through it with their advanced cameras and telescopes you
