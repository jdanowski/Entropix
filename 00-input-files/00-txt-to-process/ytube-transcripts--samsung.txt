a new virtual assistant sam is unofficially replacing samsung's bixby which probably outshines the fact that she's hot in so many ways let's be honest bixby's and only ever gets in the way considering there's a button on most samsung phones entirely dedicated to its virtual assistant and it gets in the way every time especially since it's commonly located directly under the volume button obviously samsung needs to make their virtual assistant palatable in a world where all other assistants outshine their own and this woman could be the perfect one to do it unfortunately it looks like the world won't be seeing the rendered women come to life in phones as the actual images were created by lightfarm a brazilian studio and uploaded on the 28th of may this year this is not the first time the internet has picked up 3d renders and mistook them for official assets the 3d door of the explorer image is a great example of this having been created in 2018 as fernhout by demas vian that said the fact that the idea of a cartoon virtual assistant is extremely popular ties into the culture surrounding waifu's or having 2d or 3d girls as girlfriends instead of real human women it's reminiscent of the japanese guy who married his hatsune miku hologram in 2018. this blurring of humankind's relationship with technology is often played for laughs or horror but does bring up the very real question if we manage to invent proper artificial intelligence in the future that mimics a human in every way will people fall in love with them will we have a situation like the 2013 film her in which dating an ai becomes common or see people loving replicants and holograms like joy from blade runner at any rate the fact is that there are massive portions of humanity who find the idea of this alluring and exciting which does explain a lot as to why samsung sam has blown up recently if anything perhaps meme culture is demonstrating the fact that now is absolutely the right time for big tech companies to lean a little more towards japanese business practices and give their virtual assets a face on the other hand this may lead to unspeakable horror in the region of the uncanny valley so either way it should be interesting to see if samsung takes notice of the unofficial assistant and swaps out bixby for good essentially it's clear there's unholy thirst for humanized virtual assistants and it should be interesting to see whether meme culture has a measurable effect on the decisions of big tech companies marketing strategies going forward what meme would you guys like me to give a lesson in next let me know in the comments below and remember like and subscribe or else okay guys so today we're going to be determining exactly how long the samsung virtual assistant girl's penis is now at first this seems like a really easy one to do i figured that all i was going to have to do is just make a quick google search in order to determine what the average length of penises is for women but sadly for all of us it would appear as though the average length is minuscule and frankly if she doesn't have a penis then i don't want it you see guys i'm actually misogynistic and it's for this reason i believe that the samsung girl should actually have a penis after all if we're going to be asking her all of these questions then we need her to be smart in order to provide us with the correct answers can we truly trust a woman to give us the correct information for example ask the average woman what the exact distance is from the earth to the moon would she be able to answer with the correct digits up to the hundredths place i don't think that she could essentially what i'm saying here is that if the samsung virtual assistant girl did have a penis then her iq would probably raise rather significantly now whoa whoa don't get me wrong here okay i'm the first one to admit that i'm misogynistic and here's why that's a good thing frankly humanity is far surpassed the need for reproduction and in that sense the need for women ah and that's why i think that these virtual waifus are really a good thing for humanity going into the future those of us anime watchers have far surpassed the male hierarchy you could say that we live outside of it but not only outside of it outside outside of it some people like to call themselves sigma males i call myself a ligament after all why should us male men have to listen to women have to deal with them on a daily basis even inside of our phones really i think that the samsung virtual assistant girl should actually just be a cute fanboy but no instead samsung has chosen to include a inferior creature within my phone imagine how much better it could have been if she was a fanboy pulling out the pen on the galaxy note would be the equivalent of stroking this you see here we use this is our chance this is our last chance to finally rid ourselves of the women problem along frankly i don't even care if this is just a ploy for us to buy samsung phones anymore this represents far more than that this is the end of an era the end of a gender and the end of half of the population of humanity so you know what samsung virtual assistant girl also known by the name of sam in spite of your being female i do thank you for what you've done for this world as you've allowed us to take the next step and hopefully your next update will be completely male you know what women i hate those it you it way too easy that's why i can't believe one day samsung go is scrolling through the internet when she comes across not safe for work fan out of her and she screams little do these artists know samsung girl is actually an android and apparently 17 which makes it very illegal in some states so she transforms into a buff burly jojo character and goes on an adventure to track down these lewd artists and deliver their just punishments this is a samsung girl i i can explain yakamashi get donuted simp pulling up my list all right one down three thousand more and counting to go time to find the simp in hawaii [Music] eventually they simp has stopped thinking we are finally down to the last simp and here is apple headquarters yes the mastermind behold is not safe for what plan was me apple and bruh and i also have jojo character abilities [Music] for the last four or five months i've been dabbling with the galaxy s21 plus and i honestly think that this is one solid device so hello there guys i'm vic here from phone arena with a bit of a long-term review of the samsung galaxy s21 plus also thanks to best buy for sponsoring this video they have some killer discounts which you can hear about a bit later frankly the s21 plus is one solid device i really wanted to started this video more interestingly but i don't know how else to describe it i mean the design is nice i have the phantom violet model here with me and it looks and feels different than anything else i've held in a while the frame itself feels nice and cold in the hand and it's rather comfy at no point did i feel that i would drop the device but i did find the frosted glass back to be on the slippery side at least it's not a grease magnet like the s20 series one thing i'd like to throw here though is that i've used samsung devices since the s6 and one thing i didn't like about the s21 plus was the missing micro sd card slot i did eventually get used to not having it though i consider transferring my photos to my computer via a card reader to be faster but usb connection speeds have caught up so it's not a terrible thing to see go away i mean if i got used to it then i'm assuming you can on the topic of things going away i'm not sure why my charger had to be taken away but i guess this will be you know kind of the new norm for flagship devices at least the boxes are kind of you know just more tiny and cute display wise my eyes are happy this display is freakishly bright during the day outdoors and it can also be quite dim during the night also if you remember this year's s21 series dropped its resolution down to 1080p which i think was a limiting decision i would have preferred to have at least the option to choose a higher resolution anyway i haven't really felt bothered by this panel the new adaptive option for the high refresh rate is perfect the phone is able to switch between a high and low refresh rate on the fly it's not something you'll notice and it'll save you some battery i'm also digging the new fingerprint scanner it used to be slower before and i've noticed that it's sitting a bit higher this time around on the screen you know towards the center but i got used to that my thumb is usually a bit worn down since i tend to do some manual labor yet it still manages to scan it most of the time without issue now might also be a good time to add that the haptic feedback is a bit weak on this device it didn't really bother me since i don't really like a strong buzzer also can we just take a moment to appreciate how nowadays almost all flagship devices are water resistant i had a blast taking some shots on a boat in the lake it started raining a bit which made for some perfect snow motion videos of course i couldn't really drop it because it's not waterproof nor does it really float but on the topic of these slow motion videos i just love how the s21 plus includes a pro video mode it's pretty neat because you can adjust actually the shutter speed you can adjust the iso and also manual focus it's pretty cool and you can choose between normally directional microphones or what have you and the cool thing is about these microphones specifically is that they're actually pretty nice like you can vlog on this phone if you really wanted to and it would do it with breeze the s21 plus camera app opens quickly takes quick shots too the ultrawide is not something special like you can't really focus with it but it does record up to 4k at 60fps which is very nice you can also depend on it during the day with ease it makes for some cool shots and it you know won't wow you but it won't disappoint you too it can't really focus on specific subjects like on the s21 ultra but it's really consistent and the zoom camera well i'll be honest here it's it's a hybrid type of zoom meaning that it uses a high megapixel sensor to crop in and that's how it zooms so to say it's not really as good as having a dedicated optical sensor though much like on the s20 fe which has one so it's not exactly as clear as those but it tends to do the job if you really need something like that so yeah but i would still prefer having a dedicated lens for this option and regarding the selfie camera as i mentioned you can vlog on this phone if you wanted to for the most part i noticed very adequate stabilization i strongly recommend a gimbal but the stabilization of this phone isn't exactly bad as i'll show you in a bit this is handheld so uh it's not exactly the best but it's actually miles better than some other phones and devices and once again i'm a pretty big fan of the dedicated microphones of this phone they're certainly not as good as a dedicated audio recording setup but they nail like 90 of scenarios in which you'd want to record a video so that's pretty cool and you can actually hear a bit of detail left and right and yeah they actually also capture audio pretty far away which is really neat with that out of the way i want to take a moment to mention something about the battery and performance or at least i want to confirm that the s21 plus is an amazing performer i was never really in the need of battery juice while out and about maybe there was this one time but for the most part i'm pretty happy with how it holds up this does kind of remind me of my old s6 and how it lasted me barely half a day yeah good times but seriously the s21 plus can probably last me two full days if i'm busy at work so the battery is barely losing juice while on standby of course i'd still recommend you charge it at least a bit in the evening unless you want to be going strong a second day and end up having to charge at midday like i usually do and like it happened yesterday specifically and in case you're wondering what i do on my phone i've mainly used the camera from time to time browse reddit and watch a bit of youtube also unless samsung did bad with their previous exynos 990 chipset but my motto here uses the new exynos 2100 and it's doing mighty fine i've had some fun playing games but to be honest i don't really play games on my phone on my pc sure yeah but not on my phone just in case though i tried out some gimshan impact and i was getting decent 60fps even pushing the maximum graphics was fine but i was feeling the phone heating up and some frames dropped from time to time then again this game is also a bit heavy for other devices too so you know think about a grain of salt in any case the s21 plus had no issue whatsoever with keeping things smooth everywhere everywhere else stutters are non-existent or even if you notice them you'd be more surprised and annoyed also while playing a game or two and while watching youtube i've had a decent amount of time to listen to this phone's speakers and here's the thing they're far from the best i've heard like on the rog 5 but they're miles better than the worst and even better than the speakers of some laptops the highs aren't distorted or anything but they're missing a bit of bass compared to the best on the market maybe even a bit of richness although they are quite loud i've given that by the way i assume you recall samsung dex using your phone as a substitute for your computer is pretty neat and i'm sure that with the right setup i can manage spreadsheets and some basic documents maybe watch some videos you know on my phone through a monitor which is pretty cool on the big screen you know but still i also find decks a bit lacking for the things i'd like to do on it i sometimes write code in c plus and i would love to have a neat setup for that on decks but i can't because there is no longer support for linux on decks also i'd have to constantly keep my phone hooked up to a charger unless i plan to not use the phone for the rest of the day and i just don't think that's the best thing for the battery anyways one other thing iphones usually receive around five years of support and this is something i envy evapos so much which is why i'm actually happy to see samsung promising three generations of software updates on their devices now my updates specifically have been consistent so far and i hope this trend continues until the end much like how best buy will continue to offer great deals at great times if you're interested in the galaxy s21 plus and believe you enjoy it as much as i do or any samsung device for that matter then you'd be delighted to know that best buy has you covered right now there is a special samsung deals week over at best buy and the price cuts are actually really nice if you get a carrier locked device and activate it later then you're looking at around a 400 discount but even if you're not into that there is the option of getting a 200 price cut if you go with an unlocked device also if i'm not mistaken galaxy watches are on a discount too and you're looking at around 200 off with 150 dollars in instant savings if you do a trade-in in all honesty now might be a good time for an upgrade but if you're worried about the pandemic or anything i'd recommend you try out curbside pickup just make sure the store near you supports this option order what you want and you can get it right in front of the store without having to go inside so if you're interested in a new galaxy device try our link below and let us know how it went but now since i mentioned that there is a sale would you guys actually go with another device i'm actually curious since the s21 and s21 ultra exist let's just not forget that there are other manufacturers out there like i really like the design of sony devices and the xperia one mark ii camera specifically is pretty enticing for a price bump of 150 dollars of course and the regular s21 is pretty much the same phone but smaller and cheaper so uh yeah would you guys actually still go with the s21 plus knowing all of that or you know do you think that it's a tad too big compared to the regular s21 or anything just you know i'm actually interested to hear your thoughts on it let me know guys down in the comments below also please subscribe and i'll see you guys some other time [Music] you samsung and google in theory at least should be best friends samsung is the dominant seller of android phones they're putting google's operating system in the hands of hundreds of millions and google is giving samsung the tools to make them but i'm not even exaggerating when i say this these two companies despise each other you might have noticed if you've ever tried to buy a samsung phone that this company has tried to remove every trace of it actually being run on google software they've used a different design direction different color palettes and more importantly different apps they want you to use samsung's calendar samsung's internet browser samsung's notes all instead of google's alternatives plus in areas where samsung just can't compete with google they've partnered up with microsoft instead of pushing google docs they push microsoft word instead of backing your photos up to google drive they use the much less popular microsoft onedrive and actually just recently with the note 20 series of phones they've doubled down on this partnership samsung went out of their way to show how their phones would work great with microsoft xcloud game streaming service which is a massive blow to google considering that they are also working on their own game streaming platform stadia i could go on about instances of this all day google developed android tv samsung went we're good we're going to make our own smart tv os google introduced daydream vr samsung focused on their own gear vr and probably the biggest blow was when google unveiled their new operating system for smartwatches and samsung even used it for a bit only then to announce that they were creating their own os and that they were going to make all future watches based on that so you get the idea samsung is doing everything in their power to distance themselves as much as possible from google and honestly it's heartbreaking if these two companies put their heads together they would be unstoppable i genuinely think that samsung makes the best phone hardware out there there's very little that rivals the feel and the look of their latest note 20 ultra but google makes the best android software their pixel 4a is a perfect example of this a phone with pretty crummy hardware all things considered but it's still an amazing phone just thanks to its intelligence put google software on samsung hardware and you've got a potent iphone rival so why the beef why is there no love lost between these two companies well i would argue it's because with tech hardware is getting good generally speaking in 2020 you can buy a good smartphone and it'll probably last you four years buy a good computer it could last you eight pretty much all signs point towards the majority of future profits being from software and services as opposed to just selling the hardware itself because for a lot of people the hardware they already have is good enough now this is a problem for samsung because they've always really been a hardware company they make great screens and beautiful designs but to really ensure future profits samsung wants to be your health tracker your payment provider your hub for services so google who more or less wants the same thing is actually samsung's biggest and closest competitor oh and if you're enjoying this video by the way a sub to the channel would be extraordinary if you're wondering why samsung is so keen on partnering up with microsoft it's because both of those companies have the same objective to beat google microsoft has famously fought google on the windows front trying to push its own microsoft edge browser over chrome and bing as the default search engine instead of google search plus the whole microsoft office versus google's office suite of apps and samsung has fought this battle on the smartphone front so both companies are actually quite aligned in terms of objectives and they don't really get in the way of each other samsung wants the smartphone and the wearables market microsoft wants the computer and the gaming market did you notice how while apple said no to having microsoft's xcloud gaming platform on the apple app store samsung said come on over you can host xcloud on our galaxy app store no problem and actually let's go further and make it so that samsung users get exclusive xcloud features when google and apple said no to fortnite on their app stores because fortnite were trying to use an unapproved payment mechanism samsung had no problem at all keeping fortnite on their app store because as far as they were concerned this was a free advantage they could have over google android and it's been very clear for a long time that this is what samsung has wanted right from the off samsung would plaster their phones in a software skin called touchwiz and people at the time would often ask why samsung bothered with such a heavy skin that pretty much left android unrecognizable well it was actually quite deliberate samsung didn't want people to think i'm buying a google phone they wanted people to think i'm buying a samsung phone they pretty much wanted to completely dissociate google's role in their products they then started one by one adding in samsung replacement apps for just about every main google app out there they even licensed here maps as their google maps competitor it was pretty clear at this stage that samsung could have they would have ditched android itself and they tried alongside the first android-powered galaxy s phone they also released a phone called the samsung wave and this was the phone they actually wanted to take off it was made to look just like their android phones it even ran on touchwiz but it wasn't actually android it runs on their own in-house bada os because if you own the os you've got full control you can almost force feed people your services they tried again in 2015 with a smartphone running on samsung's own tizen os the z1 again it flopped but i think at this stage google was genuinely starting to worry about the future of android because really if any company had the power to disrupt it it wasn't apple as much the biggest threat was samsung if samsung did come out with a successful os of their own then in one fell swoop they wouldn't just be gaining hundreds of millions of users but they'd be actively stealing them from google samsung was so powerful at this stage that android could have lost 60 of its user base which overnight would make android a side piece to samsung os so google had to put a stop to it and the way they did this was through the purchase of motorola mobility for 12.5 billion dollars now on the face of it this seems kind of unrelated almost senseless we're talking 2011 here which was a real low point for motorola they were basically head in the sand debt google said that their reasoning was to acquire motorola's patents to which a lot of people thought okay fair enough that sounds cool but really 12.5 billion for motorola's patents i don't think so i think there was a different motive that google's acquisition of motorola was at least in part a threat there was google saying to samsung look if you don't stop messing around with our android if you don't stop trying to basically create your own version of it then we're gonna have to step in thanks to this motorola acquisition we now have the capacity to build our own android phones android phones that run pure google android phones that we can subsidize because we don't even need to make a profit on them when samsung didn't respond google carried through with this and went on to drop the pretty well received moto x and moto g phones the plan worked within a few short years samsung came back to google with an agreement that said okay we're gonna tone down touchwiz okay we're gonna give people google alternatives to samsung apps and okay we're gonna keep the general look and feel of google stock android and if it wasn't clear that this was google's plan all along then literally two days after this agreement was signed google sold motorola mobility they sold it for a huge loss 2.91 billion versus the 12.5 they paid for it but they didn't care it served its purpose okay i would love to tell you that this is where the feud ended this is where samsung and google became friends and they lived happily ever after but it didn't change the fact that fundamentally both companies were still after the same software and services market in fact the battle got worse in 2016 samsung had the biggest pr nightmare of their lifetime with the exploding galaxy note 7s and shortly after google announces the pixel phones google made high-end android smartphones and even though these were framed as targeting the iphone making fun of their camera bumps and their lack of headphone jacks google knew full well that the pixel phones were actually far closer alternatives to samsung's flagships effectively kicking the company while they were down and i'm pretty convinced that the pixel phones were less about trying to make money off selling hardware and more about just guiding the android market because let's be real the actual money google makes or selling pixel phones themselves is nothing it's pennies versus their monstrous ad revenue google doesn't care about hardware as long as people are using their services but because samsung is trying to steer people away from google services that's why google had to intervene the pixel phones were google's way of showing the world how good google services were and how good android could be if other companies actually use them properly to basically make samsung look bad for preloading 50 applications onto every phone and to pressure them to stop this is why google made the pixels as clean and bloatware free as possible to highlight how much bloatware samsung put on their phones it's why they gave pixel users an unlimited amount of high quality storage through google photos it's the reason why google gave the pixels access to exclusive android features before anyone else got them they weren't trying to make the best highest end android flagship in the world they weren't trying to overtake something in sales they were just trying to make a poster boy for google services samsung fought back in april of next year they dropped the galaxy s8 their flashiest ever piece of hardware but more importantly a phone that was just one big screw you to google samsung pushed its own bixby virtual assistant hard even going as far as to add a dedicated button for it on their phones which at launch you couldn't even change and at the same event they announced samsung connect home which is basically their version of google home the subtext of this event the message samsung was trying to get across was not particularly by a galaxy s8 it was just by samsung buy into our entire ecosystem it wasn't enough and it probably never will be enough i would argue that google has already won this battle google's master stroke the thing which i'm assuming they've planned is that they've been working with android developers to make sure that android apps rely on google's core services to work for example uber uber actually uses map data from google maps and that's the reason why on a huawei phone where there's no google maps uber doesn't work and by a similar logic if in 2020 samsung decides to try and license its own map service and distance itself from google services uber would need to be completely reworked to work on a samsung phone it's the same for netflix it's the same for banking apps it's the same for even whatsapp the main way to back up your whatsapp chats is via google drive so if you don't have google core services you can't do that so what it looks like google has done is subtly woven themselves into the fabric of even third-party apps such that if you don't have google services they won't work properly so either samsung starts an entirely new operating system from scratch which is almost impossible at this stage or they stick to android in which case they're inevitably tied to google now all of this is a massive shame and it's very possible that google's power is going to rise further and that samsung's ties with microsoft are only about to accelerate but there is a silver lining so apparently there are some reports that samsung is actually talking to google about potentially phasing out some samsung services like bixby great and swapping them for google services in exchange for a revenue share some sort of percentage cut of whatever google makes from them and i won't lie to you i would love for this to happen samsung phones will be better because of it they'll happily endorse google services which in some cases like assistants are just better google software business will grow hugely and samsung will actually want it to because the more google earns from their software the better samsung does thanks to their revenue share this is only a possibility we don't actually know if it's going to happen but as far as i can see it's about as good a conclusion as you can come to anyway let me know if you're team samsung or team google in this battle and do consider subscribing if you enjoyed my name is aaron this is mr who's the boss and i'll catch you in the next one [Music] you how to share files via Wi-Fi direct on a samsung galaxy s4 so you can use the s4 to share files with another enable another Wi-Fi the record label device it can be another samsung galaxy s4 s3 computer or log book so doesn't matter what device it is as long as it can support the Wi-Fi direct you can basically share files from in here in this video's we're going to show you how to connect the Wi-Fi direct and how to share files so first you need to tap on the menu k at the bottom and tap on settings then some settings tap on Wi-Fi and a wife is rain at the bottom you can tap on Wi-Fi direct so on this with device here now is going to try to scan for any Wi-Fi direct and I boo device so here you can see i have a galaxy s3 here it detects my other device g i'm just going to tap on it try to connect so once I tablet the other device has been invited to to connect so i can edit decline or accept the connection so i'm going to take on except so now that's how both devices are connected to each other i can then start to share files so I can share any documents or pictures or images so I'm just going to go back to the home key I'm going to actually launch my my files manager then in here i'm going to go to d same go to my camera i'm going to share one of these files near actually if we try to share two files at the same time then press on a milky the bottom here I'm going to tap on the share button on the top here then basically I can share using a several methods in this video we're going to share it through Wi-Fi direct you just tap on Wi-Fi direct then I'm just going to tap on now where I won t shirt and tap on done you can see here says trying to file save sending the files so that the top of the swing you can see there is a upload icon here so if i drag down you saying that is some task completes sending the file so this one more to go so all my auto device basically if you look here so it's a dively safer files from my other galaxy s4 so that's how you can share files between a to Wi-Fi enable Wi-Fi direct an able device thank you for watching this video if you have any questions just live on a comment below and don't forget to subscribe to our channels if you like this video thank you for watching [Music] [Music] thanks for watching samsung's voice assistant sam hey everyone wagner welcome back to another video in this video i'm going to be covering something a little bit different than usual because i'm going to be talking about something i found on tick tock and it's honestly pretty funny to me but before we get into the video if at any point you enjoy it please consider subscribing as the support recently has been immense seriously i can't thank you guys enough for helping me hit 10k it means a lot so yeah in this video i'm gonna be talking about iphone shadow samsung and their new virtual assistant also for a legal reason samsung is not iphone's shadow but to summarize what's happened pretty quick is basically samsung came out with a new virtual assistant and this virtual assistant is not like siri not like echo not like alexa it it's realistic and let's just say that all of tick tock is basically simping over this character i first i'm gonna be skimming over this article to see if we can learn a thing or two more about this character named sam and then i'm gonna show you some of the most down bad tick tocks i think i've ever seen so make sure to stick around to the end of the video because you don't want to miss it alright so samsung is allegedly working on its new virtual system called sam unlike bixby the company's previous virtual assistant the new version is a 3d 3-dimensional character previously apple's main competitor only launched a 2d model for its virtual assistant the current bixby model and now some rovers and speculations are releasing some screenshots of a weighted 3d version of samsung's virtual assistant and then there's some photos attached of this person named sam and oh my god i've never seen more people down atrocious down in the dumpsters bro than recently like these people are really starving i can't directly say what i want to say but there's a certain group of individuals or artists if you want to call him that that draw specific things for characters and they've already gotten onto this character named sam with that many fans are now excited for the new character which underwent a radical change especially when it comes to the virtual design based on leaks photos and videos the tech giant's company new surface has more extensions textures and poses these new features are expected to make samsung's virtual assistant more modern and interesting if you haven't seen sam here's what she actually looks like the more photos and like guys just think about that there's people that actually talk to like siri like genuine conversations what are they gonna do when they talk to a quote unquote virtual assistant that actually looks like a real person just animated 2025 all girlfriends are virtual alright this is actually going to facilitate whether or not people are going to be down in the dumps for the rest of their life how does sam work as of the moment samsung hasn't confirmed the details about sam's features although this is the case you can still have some idea based on bixby's current capabilities pocket lint previously reported that samsung's current virtual assistant is specifically designed to carry out a full range of interactions these include carrying out a single task on the other hand this virtual feature can also be used to understand natural language which allows it to identify what the user wants to do even if they don't speak thanks to samsung's efforts bixby currently can know what you want even if your statements are incomplete then just list some other features of bixby which you really don't care about it all comes down to what sam can do not bixby when i say there's down bad people on tick tock oh my god you should see the people on twitter take a look at this i mean this person made a whole ass edit for some character that was really released two days ago good god society also if you're young please do not go on twitter and search up samsung sam this stuff is actually deplorable holy freaking crap man i just want to bang samsung same so bad i can't stand it anymore every time i turn my phone i get i've seen literally every rule of rule posters on her online my dreams are nothing but constant the down expialidocious like i get there's a lot of people in my discord server that like have waifus and whatnot but good god this assistant this literal virtual assistant for a mobile company came out two days ago good god this video pretty much sums up how down bad people are i also found a tick tock which states that sam is actually a virtual assistant guy and nothing against that whatever but like there's a lot of people that probably think the same

[Music] oh [Music] hey guys this is samsung's best 4k tv for 2021 the qn90a series this tv has neo qled technology that allows it to look almost as good as oled in my tests and that's high praise how does samsung do it let's take a look so the key here is mini led that's right the leds behind the tv screen here are 40 times smaller samsung says than a standard led and that means they can pack more of them in there and get a more precise illumination we'll get to the benefits of all that in the picture quality section soon but i'll just leave you with this this is the first time samsung has used mini led in its tvs and wow you can really tell the difference i'm going to start with design however this is a typically very sleek looking samsung television this tv is a 65 inch size there's also a 50 55 75 and whopping 85 inch in the series and they do cost a couple hundred dollars less than oled but really in the same ballpark if you're in this high end of the market so the design this tv has a super slick bezel around the edge the picture goes right up to that edge there's a tiny little samsung logo but the biggest thing i like is the stand so this is a nice small footprint kind of centralized and the way that it's designed it sort of floats the panel above my credenza here so it has that nice sort of floaty look that again kind of suspends the panel so really cool you look at it from the side you can see that it's sort of a cup shape a c-shape seen from the side again to hold this panel up another cool thing about the back of this tv there are these channels you can run along the back to hide the wires and kind of keep a nice clean look overall of course a lot of people in this price bracket are going to wall mount so that actually helps there too of course seen from the side this tv isn't going to be as thin as an oled television those are really really thin this tv has a full array local dimming backlight so a little bit thicker but hey who watches tv from the side anyway right you can also connect an optional logitech webcam for features like video chat and yes fitness tracking seen here when i first demoed samsung's new tvs for ces so what else is new for 2021 well samsung put a solar panel on the remote you flip it over you can actually charge this thing samsung says using standard indoor lighting or sunlight of course i really didn't test that i'll be honest with you the remote had plenty of juice for the you know couple weeks that i've had it to test but you can also plug in a usbc right in here if you want to top off the battery of course the main benefit to this remote it's rechargeable so you don't need to replace the batteries constantly which again helps the environment in the hand i really like the feel of this remote really slick design typical samsung again really simplistic controls easy to use i also like that the shortcuts to netflix amazon video and even samsung's own tv plus system are nice and discreet not those garish colors with the logos you see on a lot of other remotes so let's pop into the menu system here again not much has changed this time you see along the bottom here you have samsung's standard menu system that pops up when you hit the home key the apps are arranged nicely you can rearrange them how you want you can see also that i've put some connected devices here toward the front so my roku my xbox easy to get to you can scroll over here you get into more advanced features for example that's samsung's app store you can search from here access samsung smartthings which is their smart home feature jump right to a different input and of course go to advanced settings which includes picture settings again you can just pop right up play with those really easily it's nice to have this kind of design right here and have it all running in the foreground while you have whatever you're watching in the background i prefer that to menu systems that take up the entire screen now one thing that is missing from this tv it doesn't have dolby vision so that hdr format is available on a lot of the competition samsung still doesn't include it so when you go into apps where you connect a device you won't have dolby vision as an option i don't consider that a huge deal breaker however because this tv performs really well without needing that hdr format still works fine with hdr 10 and hdr 10 plus another extra built into this tv is voice assistance yes you get the choice of three samsung's own bixby or amazon alexa or google assistant you can use those just from pressing the mic button on the remote or new for this year you can use a wake word alexa and there she is comes right up without having to touch the remote you can turn that always on always listening feature off if you'd like to another new addition for 2021 is something samsung's calling the game bar so gamers out there who want to get access to instant stats will appreciate just holding down on the play key will get this game bar to pop up on the bottom it'll show you frames per second in real time which is pretty cool variable refresh rate status and even whether you're in the res the right input lag connection also the tv has an ability to jump right into the game menu from there and play around with deeper settings now samsung's game mode isn't quite as extensive as the one found on lg oled but it's still pretty cool and again having the instant access to those stats really nice of course on the q90a you do get top-notch gaming features including 4k 120 hertz input as well as variable refresh rate which includes freesync from amd and auto game mode so plug in a game console it'll flip right to the game mode worked really well in my testing with an xbox series x so speaking of gaming one of my comparisons was using an xbox to feed this samsung next to an lg oled and a vizio television the results are really good the samsung had excellent picture quality in game mode didn't have quite the contrast uh that and theatricality that i saw on the oled tv the game mode here favored bringing up the details in the shadows a little bit more but the brightness was there the extra picture brightness especially with gaming and hdr really pops on this tv compared to an oled model and that extra brightness is the story as well with standard video not just games let's talk about how that works now in a nutshell this samsung is the best non-oled tv i've ever tested and in a lot of ways it's actually better than an oled tv i'll start with brightness in my measurements this thing measured about nits in its most accurate picture mode that's about twice as much as i got out of the brightest television i've ever tested from oled that's lg's g1 which i compared this tv directly to in those comparisons that brightness really showed up especially in areas that were brighter overall for example a white area or some skies things like that really allowed the technology of the mini led to shine through and overcome the brightness of the oled so lots of tvs can get brighter than oled but the key to the qn 90as performance was its excellent black levels that weren't really affected that much by blooming at all so blooming is where you can get stray illumination that plagues full array local dimming tvs i've seen from other manufacturers this one however really didn't have that issue the black stayed nice and deep even in the darkest areas now compared to oled yes it did look slightly more washed out in mixed scenes because this thing can't perfectly control that that blooming because this is not a pixel level dimming like oled but it gets really really close and again you have that extra impact and brightness of the higher light levels this tv is superb in a bright room much brighter than oled and again if you have a lot of light streaming into your environment you're really going to get a lot of mileage out of the qn90a in a couple other areas though oled continued to win for example off-angle viewing when i sat far to the side the image did wash out relatively quickly on the samsung compared to the oled which remained pretty perfect again off angle very good for an lcd but can't compete with oled i also noticed a little bit more uniformity issues on the samsung brighter areas in some areas of the screen but again super subtle another tv i used my comparisons was a vizio px it actually measured brighter than the samsung but it didn't have the same kind of contrast and pop it had a little bit more blooming and the black levels were raised again its black light wasn't quite as precise as on the samsung so the samsung qn 90a is a similar price to oled tvs a little bit less expensive but they're in the same ballpark so the question is which one would i rather watch if i had to pick one i'd still go with oled it's extra contrast puts it over the edge and the off angle icing on the cake however if i had a brighter room the qn90a would be my pick this tv again shines so bright that great hdr impact still very solid and if for some reason you don't want an oled tv this is really as close as you're going to get that's a quick look at samsung's qn 90a i'm david katzmeyer from cnet so it's been 52 days or nearly two months since i first got my hands on samsung's galaxy a52 5g one of samsung's latest value and feature-packed phones in this video i want to talk to you about some of the new experiences i've had with the a52 in the past two months and share some insights on whether or not i can personally recommend this phone to you or someone you know who may be considering buying one let's get started starting with what makes the samsung a series phones such a worthy consideration in the first place price at the time of release the samsung galaxy a52 5g which currently comes in this black color here and is packed with 128 gigabytes of storage and 6 gigabytes of ram is around 500 but at the time of this video's release samsung has lowered the price to 400 which is honestly an amazing value for what you're getting here if you want to check out this deal or check the latest pricing whenever you may be watching this video then feel free to check out the first link in the description below in exchange for that price you are getting a 6.5 inch 1080p amoled display with a hertz refresh rate for smooth scrolling and navigating a large 4500 milliamp hour battery to power all of that screen and all new design for the a series phone which i think looks a lot like samsung's higher end phones and a lot of other little things you will definitely appreciate like the headphone jack on the bottom a dual speaker setup for great audio while watching youtube or listening to music and a certified water resistance rating so you don't have to worry about getting caught in the rain or just getting your phone wet in general and in my daily general use over the past 52 days i've also been very happy with the snapdragon 750 g processor that powers this a52 all the apps i use and games i play run well and are able to take full advantage of the high refresh rate screen it is a really nice change of pace to see such good performance and such a responsive display on one of samsung's more affordable phones but then you may be asking yourself what's the catch what's missing on this more affordable galaxy a52 to get it down to its lower price the biggest compromise made on this phone are the build materials the feel of this phone itself is fine in the hand it's actually been pretty enjoyable in my everyday use and i am personally a big fan of the plastic back used here as it has a nice matte feel to it and should prove to be pretty durable over time but my problems with the build materials come into play with the plastic frame and the screen it thankfully hasn't happened to me yet with this a52 but a single drop on the wrong surface of these plastic framed a series phones can result in a sizable scratch or dent but what's even more shocking to me is that after simply wiping off some water off of my a52's screen on my athletic shorts a few days ago resulted in several big scratches across the upper corner of my display so with all that said i think the inside of the a52 is definitely built to last with its good specs and software but the outside will definitely need to be carefully watched over and taken care of in order for it to last my personal recommendation is to keep on the included screen protector that comes with this phone out of the box and to either use the included case or some other case out there to make sure it stays protected and while it's on my mind here's a quick look of that case that comes in the box it has all of your essential cutouts and feels very grippy in the hand and in the box alongside the phone you will also find a 15 watt fast charger a usb type a to type c charging cable and a sim ejection tool which gives you access to the sim tray on the top of the phone which has room for either two sim cards or one sim card and a micro sd card for additional storage and again it's these little things that add up to make what i think is a really compelling purchase here in the a52 i've already mentioned the headphone jack and the micro sd card slot but this phone also has a really small hole punch camera cut out at the top which hasn't been intrusive at all in my daily use and i really like the rounded bezels on this phone as well the combination of a flat display and rounded bezels means there is next to zero chance of accidental touches when interacting with this phone another feature of this phone i really appreciate is the 25 watt super fast charging capability it's unfortunate that only the 15 watt charger is included in the box but fortunately most of the newer chargers currently on the market can support samsung's faster charging speeds like this rav power brick i have here this a52 can juice up to 53 in 30 minutes time and in a little over an hour you're getting back to a full charge but how long will a full charge last you overall i think the a52 has acceptable battery life it will certainly last you a full day with whatever you are doing with the phone but i think a two-day battery life is out of the question here it still really depends on what you're doing with the phone for example almost three hours of watching youtube takes the same amount of battery as nearly an hour of playing call of duty mobile but overall there are days when i've gotten around 6 hours of screen on time which again i think is certainly acceptable considering the 120 hertz refresh rate 1080p screen resolution and those amoled visuals and the last area of this a52 i also rate as acceptable are the cameras again i think it honestly depends on what you plan to do with the cameras because taking pictures and photos from the a52 look good the selfie camera is good in my testing and on the rear you have a ton of zoom options to choose from whether that's the ultra wide the standard wide angle lens the two times optical zoom and you can digitally zoom up to 10 times but you have to keep in mind with your picture taking that the level of saturation seems to change depending on what lens you are using as you can see here the ultra wide seems to give really saturated results compared to the standard lens which definitely gives a more realistic color presentation the depth sensor also does a great job of focusing on your subject while putting a nice blur on the rest of the photo and the macro lens is really fun to use for those super close up shots but the video side of things is where i'm docking a few points from the a52 cameras because they just don't cut it for my personal use case you are able to film up to 4k but it's capped at 30 frames the only 60 frames option is at 1080p 60 which is what i personally use for my filming but all of the camera features go out the door at this setting like the super steady image stabilization and more importantly all of those zoom options if you're filming stills like this one here at 1080p 60 resolution then maybe you'll be fine the microphones also sound pretty good but if you're doing any kind of movement action shots or vlogging then things get a lot less versatile and a lot more shaky the front-facing camera is also capable of shooting 1080p60 there isn't any sort of image stabilization or anything but this is what you can expect out of the front-facing camera on the galaxy a52 5g also for whatever reason in the resolutions which you can use the zoom options transitions from the wide angle to the standard lens will cut in and out immediately which doesn't look good at all in the middle of filming but then transitions from the standard to the two times zoom look nice and smooth and again depending on your settings and what lenses are being used your amount of saturation can vary a lot like this 1080p 30 video without the super steady stabilization turned on and then the grass really blows up with that super steady turned on in the same 1080p 30 video setting so for me overall photos are a yes and videos are a no but with all those things said my final verdict of the galaxy a52 5g is this if you're looking for a more affordable smartphone that packs a lot of newer features like 5g connectivity a certified water resistance rating a fast refresh rate screen faster performance faster charging speeds and a larger battery to power all of it in addition to keeping vital features of a phone which seem to be leaving the higher end phones like a headphone jack and a micro sd card slot then this is without a doubt one of the best options out there to consider as your next smartphone as long as you are okay with making sure this phone is used with a case and a screen protector for the reasons i mentioned earlier in the video but all things considered 52 days later i have thoroughly enjoyed using the samsung galaxy a52 5g and i can highly recommend it to you or a loved one what are your thoughts though on the galaxy a52 let me know in the comments below and if you enjoyed this video then be sure to give

it's a high quality feel but keep an eye out [Music] come on [Music] so mike starts slow but he's going strong now up ahead leading the way is anisha what's up hey guys what's up it's carl and there's this pretty crazy stat how mobile usage whether that's on a phone or say tablet is outpacing both the desktop and laptop game and as we're all working from home now the big question is can you get by solely on a mobile device as people are leaving say their desktop laptops at work i know a lot of students kids are looking solely for say a tablet as their only device that they need so samsung kind of challenged me to this and i've partnered with them to showcase their dex experience which is essentially a desktop-like experience with their mobile devices so what we've got in front of me the tab s7 plus in my opinion anyways the best android tablet that you can currently get and it doesn't even come close it's got a 12.4 inch super amoled display the latest silicon on the inside it's an absolute beast yes the price matches the beastliness but for the money it's the best android experience that you can get on a tablet smartphone wise i'm rocking the s21 ultra and it kind of follows the same dna as the tab s7 plus it is on the pricier end probably one of the pricier android devices but the best experience that you can get the build is kind of top-notch this matte black finish all around i'm absolutely in love with it i know it's been out now for the past several months but since day one it hasn't really missed a beat and the silver lining if anything it has come down in price there's sales all the time so make sure you do check before you end up grabbing it on to dex mode though so typically dex mode has been available on most mobile or their higher-end devices like for example their s-series phones but i've always felt that dex has been missing something until now you've always had to connect it to say an external screen to take advantage of a larger screen real estate connect an external bluetooth mouse keyboard now with the introduction of the tab s7 with of course the keyboard case which i've got i think they kind of have solved all of those issues so this is an extra little addition it kind of comes in two different pieces so the back just kind of snaps on like so there's actually this really nifty spot for where the pen charges up top because it typically fits on the back of the tablet it's got this little built-in cutout so that fits perfectly and of course for any keyboard case combo it snaps to the bottom and it does have this little flap on the end to kind of make it a little kickstand and now you've pretty much got a laptop form factor of course with the tab inside once that's connected you're still in a very traditional mobile or tablet os swiping up to get to say the app drawer using your finger a lot to navigate and to get to all of the different apps but to launch decks it's pretty simple so you can either swipe down on the menu system and you can see dex mode or you've got the keyboard shortcut by just holding down function and hitting the dex button up top you can see samsung decks will launch and all of a sudden your desktop experience or the view on your tablet is more traditional now to say a pc the apps are more rearranged like icons now you've got the toolbar at the bottom you can see some of the apps that i kind of access the most you've got the notification tray on the bottom of course showing you all the important things like wi-fi connection battery life and of course if you have any notifications and this dex mode now with the full keyboard and trackpad combo is just so much more productive now in one place we're taking advantage of a larger display and my workflow maybe other than video editing all this stuff that i do here is actually very similar to what most people do day to day so typically in the morning i kind of kick off my day with emails kind of who doesn't do that i can size this position it where i want on my display that's something that is still tough to do on say just a mobile device only i know it's easy to fire off emails off say your phone but when you want to get super productive and you get 50 to 60 emails a day and you got to respond to them quicker i think having the full keyboard combo is just a lot faster than typing anything out on your phone so you can see that i've got my email client kind of scale to around three quarters the size of the display the nice thing dex will remember how large you launch your apps and that's because i like to do a bit of multitasking when i do my emails i also launch a bit of youtube so if we can go over there so boom we've got that launched and the third app that i always have off to the side is my twitter feed so i'm kind of scrolling through twitter to see what's new for the day i always have a starcraft 2 video playing in the bottom corner i'm an og starcraft player used to play it a lot when i was in school have dabbled with sc2 not that good in diamond league but i like to watch some of the pros play so that's kind of my productivity setup for the morning emailing takes me around an hour and a half to two hours in the morning and it's just way quicker to get through all my emails like this even if i am quickly glancing over at what's going on in sc2 i can just get by way quicker than solely on say a mobile device like my phone another great use for decks that i found is how it kind of fits in perfectly with my photo editing workflow so once again i'm still able to multitask and watch content on the side whether it's sports or even just some more youtube stuff so you can see that i've got lightroom launched and i'm editing a photo of my tycan that i took the other week and this is actually one of the few times that i use the s pen because my artsy skills aren't that good but using this to kind of manually adjust all of the sliders makes it a lot easier than using my clunky finger so all the photos that you guys have seen on instagram for the past two to three weeks have been edited in this workflow it's efficient it's great because i can still be quote unquote productive and still watch any other content i want on the side and i'm curious if any of you have a similar workflow what kind of content do you guys consume for students dex has just made that experience so much better with this combo so if you guys are doing a ton of word processing of course you've got the likes of say microsoft word on this it's pretty much the exact same as a laptop experience the keyboard combo works great and the best part you can always detach once you're done in dex mode so say i hit function decks off this will now shut off i'm back to a tablet mode and i can detach it from this little combo and now you can use your tablet as of course a standalone tablet use it for all the great things tablets are good for a lot of media consumption and the last thing that i want to talk about before you wrap up is gaming which i think is a huge component of any mobile experience a lot of us are shifting away from a traditional console or a pc and playing way more games on a mobile device graphic performance in the past couple years has just gotten so much better on mobile devices you're talking to someone who grew up using a gameboy which was larger than this but this can now play pretty much aaa titles like you'd find on say a dedicated console which is kind of mind-blowing the cool thing about dex you can play any game say that i've got on my s21 ultra on an external monitor so you can get that gaming experience all the power from your phone on a larger screen and all you need is a usbc cable and now you can pretty much rock a console quality gaming setup with a larger display you can play aaa titles and you can even pair it with a gaming controller via bluetooth i'm getting a full console experience with a mobile device so i think dex has been super cool it's really improved a lot over the past year to two i think 90 to 95 percent of us can get by our workflow our day-to-day life using either say the phone or their tablet one thing that i did kind of struggle with was video editing even if you're on premiere i still think video editing is one of the few things that's still really tough to do in the mobile space but if you guys have any other app suggestions that i could take a look at let me know down below in the comments hope you guys enjoyed this little dex demo and yeah it probably is possible to get by in the mobile world curious if any of you have made the full switch and if you no longer rock a laptop or desktop let me know and i'll catch the rest of you in one of my next vids peace Are you looking for an ultrawide monitor for
gaming? Luckily for you Samsung released a 34 inch monitor as part of their Odyssey lineup.
We recently bought and tested the Samsung Odyssey G5, the 34 inch variant, and today
we'll discuss our findings with you! Hi, I’m Kelsey a tester at RTINGS.com where
we help you find the best product for your needs. First we'll look at the design of the monitor
and then move on to the inputs. Then, we'll break down the results by each usage, such
as gaming, HDR gaming, office use, and content creation. Afterwards we'll finish with our
verdict, and compare to other competing models on the market. We bought the 34 inch Samsung Odyssey G5 LC34G55T
to test, which is the only size available for the ultrawide variant. The Samsung Odyssey
G5 is also available in 27 and 32 inch models, but they perform differently because they
have a different aspect ratio and a lower refresh rate. We also bought the 27 inch Odyssey G5 to test,
which you can read about here. "If you’d like to skip straight to our test
results, then see the links in the description below. Before getting into the nitty gritty let's
look at the design. The 34 inch Samsung Odyssey G5 is essentially a larger version of the
27 inch model. It features the same design with a 1000R curved screen, which is pretty
aggressive. It has an all plastic black body with a gamer friendly design. The stand has V-shaped feet that look like
most Samsung monitors. It feels cheap and attaches to the monitor with basic clips. The back of this monitor looks pretty basic.
The 75x75 VESA holes are visible and the cutout in the back looks like something is missing
there. Also, the VESA holes aren't even centered with the entire screen. There's a small hook
in the stand for cable management, which helps keep your setup clean. Sadly, the ergonomics of the Odyssey G5 are
terrible. You can only tilt the stand within a narrow range, and even at that the hinge
is tough to move. It's hard to place the screen in an ideal viewing position, but that's also
somewhat expected for an ultrawide monitor. Overall, the build quality is decent. It's
made out of basic plastic that really doesn't feel anything special and feels a bit cheap.
It's well-built together and there's nothing that's visibly wrong with it, but it still
doesn't feel premium either. We'll look at the results soon but let's look
at the inputs first. It's pretty limited on inputs. There are DisplayPort 1.4 and HDMI
2.0 inputs. You also get an audio output, so you can connect speakers or your headphones
to it. There's a USB port that you can use for servicing, but other than that, there
really isn't much. The screen itself is big and offers a ton
of space so that you can open multiple windows next to each other. It has a 21:9 aspect ratio,
which is what sets it apart from the 27 and 32 inch models because those have a 16:9 aspect
ratio. This monitor has a 3440x1440 resolution, which results in a pixel density of 108 PPI. Finally, let's look at the additional features,
but there aren't many. You get a Picture-by-Picture mode, so you can display images from two sources
at once side-by-side. There's also an eye saver mode that reduces the amount of blue
light, and you can add a virtual crosshair on the screen for FPS games. Now we'll move on to the testing results,
but we're gonna sort them by usages. If you want to compare to other monitors as
we buy and test them, check out our table tool here, where you can sort by different
usages and test results! One of the most important parts of gaming
is the refresh rate. This is how many times per second the screen refreshes itself and
displays a new image. This is important for motion handling. While the 27 inch model of
the Odyssey G5 has a 144Hz refresh rate, the 34 inch one can get up to 165Hz. It has variable
refresh rate support, or VRR, to reduce screen tearing when gaming. It has native Freesync
support and we confirmed G-SYNC works with NVIDIA graphics card. However, we experienced
some issues with the VRR, which we don't want to get into detail about the issues here,
so you can read about them on the review, but essentially if you're gonna game at 165Hz
you shouldn't have any problems. Now let's move onto motion handling, and an
important part of it is the response time. This is time it takes for pixels to change
from one color to the next, and a slow response time usually results in smearing with fast
moving objects. We measure the response time at its max refresh rate and at 60Hz. When
gaming at 165Hz, the response time is good, but it's still not as good as other 165Hz
monitors, which is a bit disappointing. It's a bit slower in dark transitions which could
result in some motion artifacts. At 60Hz, the response times are actually quicker
by a few milliseconds, but there's more overshoot, so you can see visible ghosting behind fast-moving
objects. Whether you're gaming at 165Hz or 60Hz, we recommend setting the overdrive setting
to Fastest because it results in the quickest response time but at the cost of adding some
overshoot. Let's look at the input lag now. This is the
delay in time from when you input your action to when it appears on screen. Like most gaming
monitors in 2021 the input lag is incredibly low whether you're gaming at its max refresh
rate or at 60Hz. You shouldn't notice any delay when gaming. However, we noticed some
inconsistencies when trying to measure our input lag. Check out the full review to know
more about these problems. Now that we talked about the gaming specific
results, lets have a quick look at the picture quality. If you game in a dark environment
then the contrast ratio is one of the most important aspects of picture quality. This
is the difference between black and white. The Odyssey G5 has a VA panel, which are known
for their high contrast, and this one is no exception. We measured a contrast of over
4500:1, so blacks look deep when viewed in the dark. This is higher than the advertised
2500:1 contrast, but it can also vary between units. Even though it doesn't have a local
dimming feature, it's still a great choice for gaming in the dark. Lastly, let's look at the reflection handling.
This is key if you game in a bright room, or if there are a few lights around, like
the RGB lighting from your peripherals. This monitor has good reflection handling with
a matte screen finish. It's fine if you have a few light sources around but it can be distracting
if there's a ton of light on it. Overall, the Odyssey G5 is great for gaming.
We encountered a ton of issues while testing but it has features and performance most gamers
are looking for, such as VRR support, quick response times, and low input lag. Now let's look at the HDR gaming performance.
HDR, or High Dynamic Range, is a video format meant to increase the details in dark and
bright scenes. Like with gaming in HDR, it still has quick response times and low input
lag. We didn't measure HDR input lag because you can only hit a refresh rate of 100Hz over
HDMI, which doesn't meet our testing standards of measuring input lag at the max refresh
rate. However, we don't expect the HDR input lag to increase. In 10 bit HDR, the max refresh rate over HDMI
is 60Hz and you can hit 120Hz over a DisplayPort connection. To avoid experiencing VRR issues
in HDR, we suggest setting the monitors refresh rate to 120Hz over DP because we didn't experience
any issues with it then. If you plan on gaming in HDR, there are a
few things to look at when it comes to picture quality. First, the contrast is once again
important because it allows the monitor to produce more details in dark scenes. It also
makes blacks look black when looking at dark scenes in dark rooms. Since the contrast ratio
on our unit is already excellent, it helps improve the picture quality in HDR. We just talked about the details in dark scenes,
but what's important for details in bright scenes? The answer to that is the HDR brightness.
The brighter a monitor can get in HDR, the better it is at displaying bright details.
In this case, the HDR brightness is just okay. It doesn't get bright enough to truly make
highlights stand out in HDR. Finally, it's also important for the monitor
to display a wide color gamut for HDR content, which is the range of colors it can display
in HDR. Sadly, this monitor can't display a wide color gamut because it can't display
all the colors needed for HDR content, and combined with its low brightness, HDR content
won't look that much different than SDR content. Most gaming monitors in 2021 aren't that good
for HDR gaming, and the Odyssey G5 is no exception. It has the gaming features you need, but it's
not that good at displaying HDR content. If you truly want the best HDR experience, it's
probably best to go for a small TV. By the way, before we speak about other uses,

use. Although it's not designed for this use and it's geared towards gamers, it's still
decent if you want to use it in an office. The main advantage of the 34 inch Odyssey
G5 is just how big it is. The large screen has plenty of space for you to open multiple
windows side-by-side. It has a 3440x1440 resolution, which helps it achieve good text clarity.
We suggest using Windows ClearType to get the sharpest text possible, but even without
it text still looks good. Having a monitor with wide viewing angles
is important if you need to share your screen with others around you. This way, the image
stays accurate whether you're viewing it from directly in front or from the side. Sadly,
this monitor has narrow viewing angles because of its VA panel. The image quickly starts
to look inaccurate when viewing off-center, so it's not ideal for sharing your screen
with others. Also, because the screen is so big, if you sit too close the edges of the
screen can look washed out. The aggressive curve is meant to reduce that issue though. What makes the screen even harder to share
with others is the fact that it has terrible ergonomics. So if you need to turn the screen
to show someone else, you would need to rotate the entire thing because the stand doesn't
offer any swivel adjustments. Also, there's no height adjustments either, which can be
disappointing if you need to raise the screen to your eye level. As we mentioned before, having good reflection
handling is key if you work in a well-lit environment. You don't want reflections from
windows or light sources to become distracting to the point where you can't see the screen.
It has good reflection handling, enough for an office space with a couple of light sources
around, but we don't suggest putting it opposite of a window with direct sunlight on it. If the reflection handling isn't enough, then
you always want a monitor with a high SDR peak brightness. It's decent and gets bright
enough to fight some glare, but once again, it won't be bright enough to combat glare
in really bright rooms. All things considered, the Odyssey G5 is decent
for office use. It mainly scores lower according to our testing standards because of the narrow
viewing angles and terrible ergonomics. So if you're just gonna sit directly in front
of the screen and don't need to share it with others around you, then you should be happy
with it. If you're a content creator, you need most
of the same features that we just talked about with office use. Larger screens are great
if you need to see your entire video timeline without scrolling too much. Also because it
has a high resolution it delivers crisp images. It's not as good as a 4k monitor, but it's
still good enough for most people. However, since it has a curved screen straight lines
may not appear straight to some people, which could be a deal breaker. As we mentioned, you need wide viewing angles
if you want to share your screen with others. Unfortunately, this monitor really isn't a
good choice for sharing the monitor with a coworker or client because they'll see an
inaccurate image. The same goes about the ergonomics. Since
they're terrible you won't be able to easily swivel the screen to show to someone else.
You would need to buy a mounting arm and wall-mount the screen if you really need that. One thing that we haven't talked about that's
a big factor for content creators is the gray uniformity. This represents how well the monitor
displays a single uniform color, like if you're on a webpage or viewing a document. Our unit
has excellent gray uniformity. The edges of the screen are a bit darker but it's not too
bad. You shouldn't have any issues but keep in mind that uniformity can vary between units. Lastly, if you're a photo or video editor
you're going to want a monitor with a wide SDR color gamut. This is the range of colors
it can display in SDR, so you want the monitor to accurately reproduce the colors you need.
It has an excellent color gamut because it has near-perfect coverage of the sRGB color
space that's used in most content. It also has good coverage of the Adobe RGB color space
used in photo editing. Because of its wide SDR color gamut, it has a fantastic color
volume, meaning it can display colors at a wide range of luminance levels. You should
also know that our unit has excellent out of the box color accuracy, so you may not
need to get it calibrated to use it to its fullest. However, accuracy can vary between
units. The Odyssey G5 is decent for content creators.
It produces a wide range of colors and they're accurate, but the screen has narrow viewing
angles and the ergonomics are terrible. Lastly, let's talk about the performance for
multimedia use. We're starting to get a bit repetitive in terms of what we're looking
at, but we'll quickly go through everything again. If you want to watch your favorite
videos and movies, the large screen provides an immersive viewing experience. However,
it has a 21:9 aspect ratio, which 16:9 shows and most YouTube videos don't support. If
that's the case, you'll see black bars at the sides. Luckily, widescreen movies are
in this format so it will fit out the entire screen. Once again, it has narrow viewing angles,
so it's not a good choice for watching your favorite videos with a few friends around.
It's best to watch from directly in front. If you tend to watch movies in dark rooms,
the excellent contrast ratio helps it produce deep blacks. Although it doesn't have a local
dimming feature to further deepen any blacks, it's still better than many monitors we've
tested. And if you want to watch videos in a well-lit
room, then once again you want that good reflection handling. If you're in a bright room it's
probably best to dim the lights a bit, but the reflection handling is still good enough
for a room with a couple of lights nearby. The Odyssey G5 is good for consuming multimedia
content thanks to its larger screen and high contrast. Although you won't be able to watch
native 4k content, it still should satisfy most people. Overall, the 34 inch Samsung Odyssey G5 is
good. It performs best for gaming because that's what it's designed for. It has low
input lag, VRR support, and quick response times, which are still sadly a bit slower
than other similar monitors. Those who game in dark rooms should appreciate its high contrast
ratio. It's decent for office use or for content creators thanks to its large screen but it
has narrow viewing angles. Also, it's decent for HDR gaming but HDR content doesn't look
all that different from SDR content because it can't display a wide color gamut and has
low HDR peak brightness. The Samsung Odyssey LC34G55T is essentially
an ultrawide version of the Samsung Odyssey G5 LC27G55T, but there are a few differences.
The 34 inch model has a DisplayPort 1.4 input while the 27 inch has DP 1.2. This allows
the 34 inch model to achieve a higher refresh rate, and it has quicker response times. The
34 inch also has a higher contrast and better color accuracy, but these can vary between
units. The Samsung Odyssey G5 and the Gigabyte G34WQC
are similar ultrawide gaming monitors. They each have a 34 inch screen with a 1440p resolution
and a VA panel. With similar panel types, they each have a high contrast ratio and narrow
viewing angles. The Samsung has a higher 165Hz refresh rate compared to 144Hz on the Gigabyte,
but motion still looks smoother on the Gigabyte. Also, the Gigabyte is better for use in bright
rooms because it gets much brighter. Lastly, the Gigabyte's stand has height adjustment
which the Samsung doesn't have. So that's it! What do you think of the 34
inch Samsung Odyssey G5? Is this monitor going to be on your must-buy list? Let us know below. Also, we're a growing company, and are expanding

you next time. you are watching cold in TV welcome to another ColdFusion video to go go here let me ask your question who built this building it's the Burj Khalifa in Dubai currently the world's tallest building okay not quite sure what about this one these are the Petronas Towers two iconic skyscrapers in Malaysia well as it turns out samsung built all of those skyscrapers sometimes when you look beneath the surface fact is often stranger than fiction the air is 1938 the Western financial system was still recovering from one of the greatest crashes in history and the Second World War was about to break out it wasn't such a rosy time but regardless in the sea are a lesser known man by the name of Lee Chou was about to change the course of history he founded a little company called Samsung a trading company that dealt with local groceries and had 40 employees at the time the company produced noodles then expanded into sugar and then wool and by the late 1950s the company had moved into insurance securities and retail in the late 1960s Samsung moved into electronics and the first ever product produced by Samsung Electronics was actually a 12-inch black-and-white TV in 1970 by 1983 the first Samsung computer had arrived this computer was a full two years ahead of Windows PCs in the 90s samsung began to rise as an international force in many industries is my new computer going to be updated in six months with the new samsung note master gives unique CPU can be easily replaced so you can keep updating and stop worrying the company went from strength to strength becoming market leaders by learning the trades of various industries through persistence in the end they became one of the most versatile companies in world history today many of us use Samsung products in our daily lives from TVs to computers to smartwatches and digital cameras to fridges and kitchenware to the chips that run our mobile phones to the actual phones themselves while this diversity is very impressive for just one company just how big is Samsung and what else are they involved in we'll make yourself comfortable guys and get ready to be surprised Samsung is much bigger than you think in this video we'll take a look at some of the awesome facts about the company and then take a look at it's mind-boggling size trust me it gets pretty crazy like most of the stuff in this channel this is the stuff you're not going to see anywhere else on YouTube let's get into it number five since 1993 Samsung Electronics has been the largest producer of memory chips in the world in fact the original iPhone and numerous other devices run on Samsung manufactured chips in addition to this in 2011 Samsung became the world's largest smartphone manufacturer number four in Korean the word Samsung means three stars the founder of Samsung Group wanted to indicate that the company was big powerful and numerous the Stars also stood for eternity have a look at this logo do you notice the opening on both ends of the ellipse were the letters s and G are located this is intended to illustrate the company's open-mindedness and desire to communicate with the world number three starting from 2006 Samsung remained the largest television manufacturer in the world they are also the largest manufacturers of LCD panels and today 98% of the AMOLED screen market is dominated by Samsung for those of you wondering AMOLED is a type of screen that doesn't require a backlight like typical LCD screens number two the company spent 14 billion dollars in research and development in just 2014 alone another interesting thing the S at the end of the Galaxy S series stands for super smart number one samsung has four hundred ninety thousand employees more employees than Apple Google and Microsoft combined bonus in 1995 Samsung invested two million dollars into the clothing brand FUBU just as they were about to go under FUBU has generated six billion dollars in sales since okay so those are some quick bite facts about the company some pretty interesting stuff but let's go a little bit deeper down the rabbit hole things get a lot crazier so just how big is Samsung well in terms of money the company made 305 a billion dollars in revenue in 2014 so is that good or not so good we need a bit of a yardstick here so how much was apples revenue in 2014 it was actually 183 billion and what about Google only 66 billion well that's not all Samsung is 17 percent of Korea's entire GDP so the question must be asked how do they make such ridiculous amounts of money to dwarf even Google well here's the secret Samsung is actually made up of 80 different businesses and affiliates these businesses are commercially and legally independent but unified by sharing a single philosophy here are some of them under the category of engineering and construction we have Samsung engineering and construction Samsung trading and investment and Samsung Heavy Industries for electronics we have Samsung Electronics Samsung electro-mechanics techwin a military arm Samsung mobile display and Samsung digital imaging to name a fear for Finance we have Samsung life insurance securities investment trust management venture investment there's also a chemical branch Samsung petrochemicals Samsung BP chemicals there's actually plenty of others as well like a marketing company called Sherrill industries samsung also has a hotel and resort business a medical center Economic Research Institute a foundation of culture a life and welfare foundation in a joint venture at Renault the company also has been making cars for 20 years and the list goes on and on and on okay so it's starting to get a little bit crazy but what are some other lesser-known things about Samsung what else are they doing well you are in for a treat so we've already mentioned that Samsung build skyscrapers but what else well under Samsung's branch samsung techwin the company also does surveillance Aeronautics automations and weapons technology some of the weapons technology that samsung has made includes a South Korean military robot designed to replace human counterparts in the Demilitarized Zone at the south and north korean border and that's not all Samsung has also made the k-9 a full-fledged army tank and if that wasn't enough Samsung also makes jet engines but let's turn things up a notch as it turns out Samsung Heavy Industries has the most efficient shipbuilding Center in the entire world it is over 400 million square feet in size and these are some of the ships that Samsung has built over the years as you can see by comparing them to a regular ship these are absolute giants colossal floating cities almost and if that's not enough Samsung runs the biggest theme park in Korea complete with the zoo and various other crazy things Samsung's size is so ridiculous that there's even a Samsung city this city contains a few of the company's businesses some other cool things include their very own clothing line and a brand new research lab for drones robotics 3d printing and virtual reality the cool thing about this lab is actually going to be part of Samsung's mobile division but it's going to operate independently and it's going to build on the work that Samsung has done through their robot vacuum cleaners and let's not forget virtual reality in general the gear VR was the first proper mobile virtual reality headset and I just got it the other day and I've been playing around with it and it actually works pretty well ok so we're reaching towards the end of the video so maybe you're starting to get the picture now that Samsung does just more than TVs fridges and phones they do pretty much everything in all my time of doing videos I've never come across so many surprises in my research and I'm not saying this to be a fanboy or anything like this it's just a matter of looking at how many things they do who would have known that the same company that dominates the smartphone industry also makes jet engines and military equipment builds some of the world's biggest ships built the world's biggest skyscraper has a medical research facility a theme park a finance institution and the list goes on and on it's said that every year of Samsung donates one hundred million dollars to its nonprofit Medical Center which consists of several hospitals and medical research facilities so in conclusion it would seem that Samsung is the kind of company that tries their hand at almost everything and chooses to observe and iterate until they get better and eventually become the market leaders in all honesty it is amazing how much of a dark horse this company is I wouldn't be surprised if most people out there are only aware of Samsung Electronics and their home appliances it's amazing to think that all of this just started from one man with his small trading company dealing in groceries so if you have a Samsung phone the next time you look at it it might just seem a little bit different now that you know the true size of the company that made it anyway this has been to go go I want to thank you for watching and if you want to see any other cool stuff on different companies or alternative science and technology news definitely feel free to subscribe cheers guys I'll see you again soon from the next video have a good one you gonna say something well okay they were just going to speaking don't you hey guys to go go yeah thanks for watching the whole way through the video that was insane like actually when I was researching the stuff on Samsung and seeing what they got up to and what the company really was about how big they were that actually surprised me myself so this kind of was a video that educated me and hopefully educated you as well and if that was the case let me know down below if he actually found something new that you didn't know about Samsung in that video and I kind of wish every company was this big and this diverse I could do more videos on this kind of thing but it just seems that our Samsung was just the biggest out there so that's why I chose this topic but anyway that's enough of me talking really just thank you for watching this video and if you liked it give a thumbs up don't forget to share it with someone if you reckon they'll get something out of this and I guess I'll see you again soon for the next video thanks watching guys see you later cold future are you thinking [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so so [Music] so so [Music] so so so [Music] foreign [Music] so so [Music] so so so so [Music] so [Music] this so so [Music] i [Music] so [Music] foreign [Music] let's go so [Music] so so so uh [Music] [Music] um foreign foreign [Music] [Music] bye [Music] Welcome to Samsung’s virtual First Look event. It is my pleasure to be with you today, to talk about our advancements in technology for 2021. Every year, CES has offered us  a chance to unveil our vision for the future, coupled with our new and exciting product portfolio. And while we would love to be together in Las Vegas, we recognize that the world is still navigating  the challenges imposed by a global pandemic. So we are bringing First Look to YOU  So you can enjoy CES safely, and from the comfort of your home. 2020 had a significant impact on all of us. However, amidst so many uncertainties and daily challenges,  we are gently reminded of the positive progress  we are making as we come together, across the world.  As we enter 2021, one thing has never been clearer – The pivotal role technology plays  in helping us carry on and stay connected.  At Samsung,  this recognition inspired us to reflect on our priorities  as we discovered a renewed sense of responsibility  to helping the world around us.  Our commitment  as one of the leading technology companies Is to do our part and achieve sustainable management. Leadership, of course,  is about more than being the best, Or being the first to market. Leadership is about the pursuit of innovation  to pave the way forward for everyone.  It requires an ongoing effort on our part to advance human-centric technology  while protecting our future and environment. This is why,  for the first time in the industry, I am proud to announce Samsung TVs are Going Green.  Our major long-term goal  is to ensure sustainable production and consumption. To that end, We will decrease our carbon footprint during the production process In a systematic and meaningful way.  We will also reduce waste  by extending the use and lifespan of resources. This means including more recycled materials across our entire TV lineup.  When it comes to E-waste,  we will affect change  by providing products that are durable and cutting-edge, through continuous software updates and enhanced repair services.  Going Green is a critical response to the environmental issues our planet faces. We hope that by taking these steps,  we will inspire others in the TV industry to follow. Our efforts are already underway. Starting in 2021, most of our products will come in eco-friendly or recycled packaging  with minimal add-ons to promote more upcycling. Our new SolarCell Remote Will use sunlight or indoor lighting to power itself,  eliminating the need for disposable batteries.  But it doesn’t stop there… Hello everyone! I’m here to talk about  the things Samsung has been doing to think clean and go green! If you’ve gone shopping for a screen recently, you’ll notice how they keep getting bigger. The packages are getting bigger too, and more elaborate. That’s because packaging is part of the branding competing for your attention. Unfortunately,  that also means they leave a bigger carbon footprint. So last year, Samsung decided to buck the trend and simplify.  We steered the industry in another direction  with Eco-packaging. Just in terms of size and volume, this presents an enormous opportunity  to significantly reduce waste. Eco-packaging goes beyond recycling to upcycling. Our minimalist package comes with a dot design that helps consumers cut and create their own projects. It gives new life to plain old boxes and invites you to get creative.  We partnered with Dezeen magazine  to promote upcycling through the Out of the Box competition. The results have been imaginative, clever,  and completely delightful! I saw a pet house I just have to try with my kids. Take a look. This has been one of the most popular competition that Dezeen has ever run. Our consumers share the same eco-friendly values that we uphold, and their ingenuity gave new life to packaging that was once considered trash. The best part of eco-packaging has been your response.  Together, we’ll do our part for a greener planet, spruce up our home décor,  and have some fun! In 2021,  Eco-packaging will expand to other products in our lineup.  We will minimize embellishments like stickers or color ink, making the upcycling process even simpler. That’s what’s happening on the outside of the box. What’s inside is changing too. Take this remote control. You never really think about it. That is, until it doesn’t work and you have to dig up fresh batteries. Who has time to keep track of them?  And we all know batteries create unwanted waste. So for both your convenience and the environment, we kept searching for ways to apply light energy. At the same time,  we would have to develop extra efficient remote controls that could be powered by solar or indoor lighting alone. We also chose to use recycled plastic, which involved turning waste into resin that met our high standards.  It wasn’t easy, but we decided to go for it. The result is the game-changing SolarCell Remote Control Based on the average life of TVs,  which is about seven years, this saves the environment from over 99 million batteries. The reduction in carbon emissions is immense. Picture 759 football fields full of pine trees. It would take all those trees an entire year to do the same work. Altogether, it was a complex process  that took an incredible amount of expertise,  dedication, and investment in R&D.  Was our remote control worth the trouble? Absolutely. We’re taking the initiative to conserve our planet. With the progress we make, It’s good to know my three kids will grow up in a greener world.  Sustainability demands careful attention and extensive investment. But what we gain is priceless: A healthy planet, consumer trust, and a bright outlook for future generations. Packages and remote controls are commonplace objects  that people take for granted. But we took a harder look  and asked uncomfortable questions about these norms. While we sometimes embrace discomfort  To disrupt the status quo, We are also aware this is not always a choice. People with visual and hearing impairments  Experience discomfort in their daily lives as a matter of course. At Samsung, we seek to provide them  with the same level of viewing experience as all our consumers. This is their story. It's easy to assume that people with Low vision, the Blind, the Hard of hearing and the Deaf can't watch TV On the contrary, they spend a great deal of time with their screens, even more than most,  because screens are their windows to the outside world So at Samsung, we strive to provide features optimized for their various needs. This is about their experiences. For people with color vision deficiency, We made it possible for them to see more colors I thought there were green flowers but they are actually red This App allows my daughter to See Colors she couldn`t see before. This technology really great for us. For people with low vision, we developed Color Inversion.  It changes the graphic menu into contrast colors, leaving the video as is.  It looks simple, but to enable this technology,  we had to start by reengineering the chip set I love this function. It's way easier to look at the menu. It's really clear what I'm on, what I'm choosing, where I'm going - I've never had that before. Then there's Audio Description, so you can hear actors' gestures and expressions being described to you This opens up new experiences for people who couldn’t appreciate movies and TV series before.   This is such a great way to understand the scenes better.  It’s not just about the screen. Something as ordinary as a remote control can feel totally unfamiliar.  We made it easier to operate remote controls as well.  In the Learn Remote Control mode,  each time you press a button,  it will tell you what that does.  Users can listen and quickly memorize the location of each button. And Voice Guide lets you know your current channel and volume level. RNIB have thoroughly enjoyed working with Samsung  on creating this range of accessible TVs, and the feedback we’ve had from our customers has been absolutely incredible. You know,  it’s the first time that blind and partially sighted people can use the whole of the smart TV independently. In 2020, we awarded Samsung TV our accessibility accreditation.  Their dedicated efforts have improved the lives of many. We also offer technology for Deaf. Magnify the sign language area by up to 200%. It’s literally there on the screen. You can see the signing really clearly, and the facial expression too.  It’s really easy to understand. You can magnify the sign language area by up to 200%. that clarity was really great. Separate the captions so they don’t cover the text of video Ah, finally i love to see that you can move the captions below the image. Which means I can see what’s going on the screen and also,  the tab is large as well so that’s perfect. We seek a solution for every inconvenience through our technology. That’s because we don’t want to exclude anyone. Our technology is for everyone. Including people like me. Accessibility has been top of mind for quite a while.  So it should come as no surprise  That we won the 2021 CES best innovation award for our efforts. It’s not why we do it, But it’s still great news! By 2022,  We will expand our Voice Guide  so no one is excluded. We will also develop a Sign Language Avatar  to guide through all the functions of Samsung TVs. We’re also planning to add a Closed Caption feature  to automatically convert any sound into text. In addition,  We are developing technology that allows the use of sign language to control  our screens,  similar to how voice recognition works. Samsung has already made substantial breakthroughs as a front runner in AI technology, Which we will use to enhance accessibility in our products. We hope to introduce many more features That offer every consumer a viewing experience without barriers. Last year, I stood before you,  Looking about the same As I introduced our vision of Screens Everywhere.  We set out to defy the limitations  on when and where screens could be used  as well as what content we could deliver.  We are determined to make another leap forward  By expanding our vision to screens for all. Screens for all encapsulates  Our mission to serve the needs of all. From our environment to its inhabitants. All of us, from young to the old, and everyone in between Whose lives have been impacted by 2020. We’re always told to look in one direction: Ahead. To be at the front of the pack.  But when technology keeps pushing us forward… We say: pause  and  look back. Look back to make sure we’re not leaving anyone behind. That our innovations are designed with people in mind.  That everyone gets an equal seat on the couch. Look back to make sure the planet is not left as an afterthought.  That we make the world less wasteful. More conscious. So the next generation won’t face the consequences of today’s choices.  Let’s take a moment to stop, breathe, and be better to the world around us.  True progress only moves us ahead when it leaves no-one behind. SCREENS EVERYWHERE. SCREENS FOR ALL. That’s our overarching mission. But you might be wondering…  What does this mean for you? Well, I am so glad the wait is over, That I can finally share this next-level viewing experience with you.

All these is possible with only Samsung Neo QLED. What do you think?  Excellent, if you ask me. I can’t wait to try some of these features.  For years,  Samsung has led the industry  with breakthroughs in screen innovations. This year,  we’re proud to build on our track record  with this Neo QLED. Let me see if I can explain  the mind-blowing new technology behind it. It all depends on the revolutionary Quantum Matrix Technology… … which begins with the Quantum Mini LED. It’s what I’m standing on right now! In reality, it is as small, as a grain of sand. Can you see the difference? In fact, it’s 1/40th the height of previous LEDs.  The reduction is made possible  through Samsung’s exclusive LED technology. Instead of using a lens to disperse light,  and a package to fix the LED in place, our Quantum Mini LED has one incredibly thin micro layer. That means we can fill the screen with more LEDs.  A lot more. And when we apply light focusing technology,  we can exert ultra-fine and precise control to the densely packed LEDs. This prevents what we call ‘blooming’  when brighter areas leak into the darker areas. With Quantum Matrix Technology, the difference is clear. Literally. We were also able to increase the luminance scale  to 12-bit with 4,096 steps making dark areas darker and bright areas  brighter In a scene like this, details come to life. Exotic places you’ve never been to, friendly faces you miss, we’ll bring them all to you. The radical reduction in LED made way for the slim and sleek Infinity One Design. Beautiful from every angle. But these design innovations are about more than aesthetics. They exist to provide you with a dynamic and captivating viewing experience. The bezel is so narrow, it’s imperceptible.  We also minimized the size of our logo. It’s like the Infinity Screen floats on air. We’re also introducing the Attachable Slim One Connect box,  a simple and elegant solution for multiple inputs and cables. When you turn it on, everything but the content fades away.  Total immersion. In an ideal world, we would always get the best possible picture quality. But peak streaming hours and slow internet connections are the reality we face. You know what I mean, who hasn’t had lagging issues? Samsung TV offers a solution With new and improved AI Upscaling.  It uses deep learning  to transform lower resolution content into higher  resolutions, up to 8K  with greater details. We achieve this through the trailblazing Neo Quantum Processor. In place of the single neural network like in previous models,  the new processor uses  up to 16 different neural networks,  each focusing on a specific type of content. Think of it as the difference between having one chef versus sixteen. For example, when you want fettuccine, you would call the chef from Tuscany. In a similar way, our neural networks have expertise in different types of content.  Enjoy superior picture quality, whenever and whatever you watch! And thanks to this upgraded processor, your TV exerts perfect control over not only the picture quality, but also the audio system, from the two center speakers to all four corners’, It’ll provide you with the ideal audio experience, every time.  Object Tracking Sound (OTS)  uses audio positioning and scene analysis  to match the sound effects with the onscreen movement. The new OTS Pro has a 6.2.2 channel audio system, so sound effects travel dynamically  from multiple positions and directions. OTS Pro also comes with greater voice clarity. We also developed SpaceFit Sound to refine audio calibrations.   No matter where you put your TV, SpaceFit Sound automatically analyzes how the sound travels based on the dimensions and acoustic characteristics of the room. It then delivers the optimal sounds for your home. When Neo QLED meets the Q-series soundbar, it creates Q-Symphony,  a symphony of harmonious sounds from every direction. It’s a new level of acoustic immersion. The technology is complicated. But the goal is simple:  we do it for you. So it’s only fitting that our product lineup  is as diverse as our consumers.  Here’s Adam, to tell us more.  Hey guys! I’m extremely excited to share  a truly unique collection of products  for those of you who want something a little out of the ordinary. It’s a lineup to enliven, uplift, and  embolden your lifestyle. Let’s start with The Frame: When turned on, you can enjoy amazing picture quality. Turn it off,  and The Frame transforms into a work of art. This year, The Frame will debut a makeover  that includes a slimmer screen  that makes pictures look even more like a real art. You can customize it to suit your taste and living space. First, there are more frame and stand options as well as a bezel you can decorate.  And through Samsung’s Art Store, The Frame gives you access to a variety of artworks from leading galleries around the world  like the Tate and Prado Museum.  From classics to contemporary,  Bringing your favorite pieces home. This is The Frame’s invitation to you,  to turn any space in your home into your own personal art gallery. No wonder it’s a bestseller. Next is The Premiere. We introduced it last year  to bring the full cinema experience into your home.  It’s a HDR 10+ enabled,  Ultra Short Throw  4K triple laser projector.  Basically, it’s phenomenal. It has distinct red, green, and blue light sources that make scenes appear more vibrant and even more colorful.  The 4.2 ch 40W all-in-one sound  is powerful enough to fill your entire space.  This all comes in a compact body  that only needs to sit just a few inches from the wall. That’s about how much space you need. Even in small spaces,  you can still project 130 inches of cinema.  Maybe that’s why,  both The Frame and The Premiere are winners of the 2021 CES Innovation Awards. One gives you the experience of the world’s art galleries the other gives you the experience of an entire movie theater.  Both within the privacy and safety of your own home. Last year, we introduced The Terrace  because we noticed how much people love spending time outdoors. They love to exercise, share a meal with friends, or nowadays, even just sitting on the patio for a bit of fresh air. But what if there’s a show you want to binge,  or a movie you want to watch  or a game you can’t miss?  Yet you still want to be outside? No problem. The Terrace has you covered. With uncompromised QLED picture quality and increased durability to battle nature’s elements, rain, hot or cold temperatures, and even dust... The Terrace will stand strong. Bringing everything you enjoy indoors, outdoors. Now the next one,  The Sero, happens to be one of my personal favorites. I spend a lot of time on my phone,  from streaming movies to social media. And that’s why I love The Sero.  By becoming an extension of my phone, It maximizes my mobile media experience and adapts to both horizontal and vertical content. When I turn my phone, the screen rotates automatically to fit the content. On top of this, it delivers a full 4.1 ch  60 watt sound experience, which is great for when I’m watching a movie or my favorite DJ goes live. It’s all the mobile content I love,  made bigger and better on The Sero.  Last, The Serif. Both TV and furniture. Both functional and beautiful. With its distinctive form,  it can be placed anywhere  with or without a stand. Created in collaboration with the French designers  Ronan & Erwan Bouroullec, it will fit beautifully into any décor  while offering brilliant QLED picture. The Serif will continue to attract design and tech enthusiasts alike.  These products will compliment any space,  no matter the size or style of your home, giving you the freedom to expand your world. It's with products like these  That samsung is enriching lifestyles And bringing more joy to our consumers.  But already, we are thinking ahead. We are pioneering screens to break new ground. Things you haven’t even imagined, are set to become a part of everyday life. That’s the promise of MICRO LEDs. We first debuted our plans for MICRO LED in 2018 with The Wall. Now only three years later, we’re unveiling models that are ready to enter your homes. This is it. The Samsung MICRO LED has arrived. You’ve seen the spectacular new screens. The 110 inch model is winner of the 2021 CES Best Innovation Award.  Here’s how it comes together. First,  the technology that goes into creating these completely new LEDs. Like the name implies, these LEDs are microscopic. It is literally thinner than a strand of hair. Can you see it? It is hardly visible. Though there are 24 million LEDs here.  As you can imagine, it’s not an easy thing to mass produce, and we were only able to succeed using  Samsung’s semiconductor micro processing expertise. It’s not just about the size though. MICRO LEDs are self-emitting, colored light sources  in red, green, and blue. There’s no loss of brightness or clarity. No other self-emitting display / does this. You get incomparable, true-to-life picture quality. But what good is quality if it doesn’t last? Samsung MICRO LEDs boast the advantage of longevity. Organic LEDs have a finite life span. If your TV uses them, you might be dreading the burn-in. That’s when the LED pixels degrade over time, leaving you with dimmer lights and discoloration. In contrast,  Samsung MICRO LEDs are made of inorganic materials which are longer lasting and more durable. They maintain flawless picture quality  for 100,000 hours. Now that’s something to look forward to.  Wait until you see how we’re using this technology. Let me start with our design innovation. Our Monolith Design gives you an uninterrupted, immersive viewing  experience with Infinity Screen.  So the screen integrates seamlessly into the surrounding space. Its elegant simplicity is further enhanced  by new / Ambient Mode Plus. Whether you want your screen to blend in,  display weather conditions,  or act as a work of art,  Ambient Mode Plus can transform your space. Just watch what happens in our collaboration with the media artist Refik Anadol.  See? How cool is that!  Next,  we want to recreate a full theater-going experience. For that, sound is just as important as picture. MICRO LED comes with center speakers, a better support for OTS Pro. Sound travels more freely  through the built-in speakers without additional equipment. This creates MICRO LED’s Arena Sound, which gives you dynamic, multi-dimensional audio for the largest screen experience ever. 4Vue can also handle up to four inputs at the same time. It’s like having four screens in one.  For example, you can plug in four game consoles. Call your friends over. All of you together, playing one legendary game.  Everything you want... all on one screen. So far, I’ve been talking about MICRO LED as the screen that breaks new ground  in video, audio, design, and usability.  But we’ve only just started to explore its full potential.  That’s because MICRO LED screens are made of / modular forms. Take this.  It looks like a single unit, but it’s actually made of many modules. This means consumers will eventually be able to customize  the size, ratio, and shape of their screens.  MICRO LED screens will open up endless possibilities  in how we see and live life. We’d like to offer you a glimpse of that amazing future. Today, we introduced the promise and innovation that represent our vision,  “Screens Everywhere. Screens for All.” We are redefining when and where screens can be used as well as who can use them and what they can do. In the process, we have embraced sustainability for the environment and future generations. At every step, we were inspired by you. Now it’s our turn. We hope our products can inspire you. To all of you watching from home, thank you. today we have plenty of news on the samsung 
galaxy s22 and that's coming up right! after this   so today we've got plenty of updates on specs and 
features of the upcoming galaxy s22 from samsung   before we get started though please 
like the video if you're a samsung fan   let me know in the comments what device 
you're actually watching today's video on,   and make sure to hit subscribe so you don't miss 
a thing so the first story of the day is about the   4nm chipset that could be powering the galaxy s22 
last week evan blast tweeted all the details about   the triple h successor currently known as the 
sm-8450 and today we've got some more information   it saw that this chip may be called the snapdragon 
895 and some sources are claiming that it won't   be coming until q3 of next year which would be 
too late for the s22 but others disagree digital   chat station who has recently dropped a lot of 
reliable leaks has said that the chip is already   being sampled by smartphone manufacturers and it's 
a bigger improvement than we saw last year from   the 865 to the 865 plus we're unsure at the moment 
if this sm 8450 chip is going to be essentially   the triple 8 plus or if it's going to be the new 
895 but we'll update as soon as we find out more   next up we have news that the galaxy s22 ultra is 
going to be the only one with a glass back in this   year's releases both the plus and the ultra had 
a glass back or the standard model was plastic   according to a south korean insider this time 
it's going to be the galaxy s22 and the s22 plus   that they're gonna have a plastic back but it's 
gonna be manufactured using a brand new processing   technology well many see this is bad news samsung 
are getting better in making plastic bags that   feel more premium and it will help samsung reduce 
the cost of the plus model on top of this it also   differentiates the phones better from samsung's 
point of view and helps the ultra stand out more   next up we've got news on the displays for the 
galaxy s22 while many blogs are quoting navarre   blog as far as i can see this leak first came from 
mori qhd he tweeted to give us all the display   sizes for the galaxy s22 and while the ultra has 
stayed the same it looks like the standard and the   plus are actually getting a reduction in display 
size according to the leak the s22 is going to be   a 6.06 inch display compared to the s21 6.2 inch 
the s22 plus is going to be a 6.55 inch display   compared to the s21 plus is 6.7 inch and the ultra 
is going to remain at 6.8 inches he also states   that the ultra will have an ltpo display for 
adaptive refresh rate which implies that the other   two will not of course smaller displays are likely 
going to mean smaller capacities as well as the   overall size should be smaller but we'll take this 
leak with a grain of salt until we get further   detail that being said when it comes to leaks 
mori qhd has proved his reliability many times   before of course there is also still a rumor going 
around about knowing display selfie camera on the   galaxy s22 but it seems to be coming from a single 
source we'll update when we hear more on this but   it's important to remember if the technology is 
good enough and it's ready on time then it's at   least gonna be in the ultra and if it's not good 
enough they'll just leave it out samsung won't do   something that's going to harm sales so if it is 
left out then it's probably for the best overall   though the galaxy s22 is looking like a great 
smartphone and as always there's a model to suit   your needs it's going to be the first time we see 
the samsung and amd partnership in action on the s   range and i'm excited to see what result that has 
for those of you waiting we're now going to run   through the expected specs design and the pricing 
for the whole galaxy s 22 series to help you guys   decide if this is the phone for you for my regular 
viewers you guys have seen this so skip to the   next video but if you are new here then make sure 
you hit subscribe and we'll get right into it   so first of all we've got the standard galaxy s22 
the galaxy s22 is going to come with a 6.2 inch   dynamic amoled display we're expecting a full hd 
plus resolution of 1080 by 2400 and of course a   120 hertz refresh rate when it comes to the selfie 
cameras we're unsure if it's gonna have a punch   hole or an in-display selfie camera as this is 
of course the budget-friendly model so we usually   find some compromises and we're also expecting 
a plastic back instead of glass on the rear it's   likely to be a triple camera setup consisting of 
a wide an ultra wide and a telephoto camera it's   going to be powered up by either the exynos or 
the snapdragon system on chip and what we know   the snapdragon chip is model number sm 8450 we 
don't know its exact name just yet it's likely   to come with 8 gigs of ram and a choice of 128 
or 256 storage and this will of course be ufs 3.1   it's likely to be powered by a 4 000 milliamp 
hour battery while fast charging has not been   confirmed yet it's likely going to be 25 watts it 
will of course have 5g wi-fi 6 and bluetooth 5.2   and it of course is going to run one ui4 based on 
android 12. and for those of you that are waiting   for the s22 it's likely going to start from 850. 
now next up we've got the samsung galaxy s22 plus   the galaxy s 22 plus is going to be coming with a 
larger 6.7 inch dynamic amoled display and going   by previous releases it's likely to be a full 
hd plus resolution of 1080 by 2400 and it will   have a 120hz ltpo display when it comes to the 
selfie cameras we don't know what sensors they're   going to be using but it is likely to adopt the 
in-display selfie camera on the rear we're likely   going to see another triple camera setup and 
again it's going to be a wide an ultra wide and   a telephoto it's going to be powered by either the 
exynos or the snapdragon system on chip and again   we don't know the exact name but the model number 
is sm 8450 it will likely come with eight gigs of   ram and the choice of 128 or 256 storage and again 
this is ufs 3.1 it will likely be powered by a 4   800 milliamp hour battery we're expecting to 
see some fast charging improvements but we still   haven't had any leaks on the battery yet it will 
of course have 5g wi-fi 6 bluetooth 5.2 and of   course one ui4 based on android 12 and for those 
waiting on the s22 plus it's likely gonna start   from eleven hundred dollars now finally we've 
got the most premium model the galaxy s22 ultra   the galaxy s22 ultra is likely to come with a 
6.8 inch dynamic amoled display but this time   with a quad hd plus resolution of something like 
1440 by 3200 it will of course be an ltpo panel   with a 120hz refresh rate we're expecting a high 
screen to body ratio we're expecting an in-display   selfie camera on the front when it comes to the 
rear we can no doubt expect a quad camera setup   with the additional laser autofocus as with 
the smaller models we should see a wide and   ultra wide and a telephoto but on the ultra we 
usually get a periscope camera with optical zoom   it should be coming with a choice of 12 or 16 gigs 
of ram and also 128 256 512 and maybe even one   terabyte storage it's likely to be powered up by 
a 5 000 milliamp hour battery but again we don't   know what fast charge it's going to offer it's 
going to have 5g wi-fi 6 bluetooth 5.2 and run on   one ui4 based on android 12. and when it comes to 
the price unfortunately as we know it's going to   be expensive we can pretty much expect a starting 
price of around 1300 so while leaks are still a   little bit light on the ground we are starting to 
get a bit of information coming in and as we get   closer to launch more and more details will come 
to light and as always i'll share them as they do   but let me know your thoughts down in the comments 
below who out there is excited for the galaxy s22   and what model are you waiting for but thanks

not sure how many hours is gonna be inside but I wanted to get frozen then I want to see kind of what happens yeah see - hey guys so it's been enough for one and a half hour and I wanna take a look how it looks so let's see here if we can get assumed in so there we have the iPhone 7 and it's hard here now at the top one and a half hour I'm not sure why I think that this one I can be completely dead the s7 or it can also be oh yeah you saw a light up there it can also be that it's used I didn't have to stay awake app but yeah let's let's let's keep it in here for a long period of time and

I pop these out right now they do look kind of frozen you know and the last time I checked you can actually see stuff happening on the iPhone but now it looks pretty frozen so can I get these up yes I can so I'm not sure how hard or stuff like that is gonna be to take these out but I'm gonna try to do my best okay gonna try to be my best yeah I thought really don't look good I really don't hope it

gonna do now is I'm just gonna go and take a fork so I can like chop them up a bit so yeah they are very very hard okay so here we have the iPhone I'm pretty sure and asked it seems like it's really hard to get inside so what I'm gonna do so I'm just gonna pour some water here first in the iPhone oh do you see how it like crack yeah that cracking noise which means it's it's starting to loosen up but and I actually never think it's been this hard before I mean it's almost like we need to put them in this huh okay now it's kind of cold again so maybe I can Oh oh sweet that turned out pretty cool oh oh that one is frozen wow it's so close and I need to put some more on it oh boy oh no it was good yeah but then this phone doesn't feel good man this does not feel good okay so we have that phone ready let's just finish up this one also open up Oh Oh how the Sonny Boy is still on what is the battery life saying let's see oh my god 92% oh my god are you for real Samsung that is insane look at the battery life 92% after 10 hours that is crazy let's just see what does it say in here if we go into battery yeah there we go 92 badly usage wow that is impressive I think that's insane that is very very cool let's see does the iPhone start because it looks Canada it looks Kennedy man it looks kind of messed up I really hope that it works whoo okay that's nice I get the starting symbol instantly it doesn't even seem that I have to charge it which is very very nice but why did it turn off that's a good question is it because it's running low on battery life no it's not huh that's very nice so as you see it still has a battery life but we don't know what it started on so that kind of sucks because I forgot to show that because you need to activate this battery percentage thing usage where it's like no it doesn't seem like you can see that okay that's weird but this one looks pretty okay too the question was why did it turn off that's kind of confusing man let's see what happens when I try to charge them like like instantly right now so I'm just gonna blow out a little bit blow up some of the worst water because I do know sometimes that something has a problem when you try to charge them after doing crazy stuff so I've disabled the power thing this second but I am going to enable them same time so let's power on here let's see okay that one charges and this one also very very nice so that seems to be go pretty well but it definitely seems like something might be a winner here first of all because it didn't close down and also because 92% still that sounds very impressive that's however a nice actually to see from something so yeah quickly already of chicken that out hope you enjoyed and definite let me know if you wanna see something else and

actually glitching out green it was blinking but now it started working it's back to fully working order it's horrible in condition guys the condition is just destroyed it's cracked guys can see there's like a green line on the right side the initial kind of impact here with the distortion and the back is the worst looks like you just went through some like robotic transformation all that glass is missing cameras actually held up pretty good which is crazy but just look at that in detail that's insane so it actually did fall about 20 stories just for reference when I dropped the galaxy fold but I wanted to make this you know as real and raw and uncut as it gets with no case next up we have the samsung galaxy fold guys this is the long-awaited crazy drop test from the staircase $2,000 for this smartphone and we're gonna see exactly what's gonna happen so of course we have that plastic screen this time around so I'll be very interesting to see even if it drops 20 stories or so how will it survive will it last or about to find out guys in 3 2 1 that was incredibly loud compared to the iPhone and there's the galaxy fault guys look at it it's also blinking except only part of this display is blinking your whoa nevermind let me take a look what is going on here the whole ride screen is kind of working the left side isn't let's go ahead and see if we can close it what happens when we close the phone oh my goodness Wow look at that guys look at the back this phone is destroyed let's see the other oh whoa so this part actually still works guys that's some good news so we can still use this phone but just that small little display here so let's try and open it up again this seems to work a little bit when I have the fold folded in half wait but as soon as I go like this turns off but then who turns back on turns off I guess it's like a little hack and just for the fun of it guys we're gonna drop both the galaxy bulb and the iPhone 11 Pro max at the same time to see as a final result so both phones obviously they're still working the actual display in the fold isn't but let's go ahead and just do it for fun see what happens in three two one again we got a green screen back his destroy you even more look at this but let's look at the big one here this is it guys the Galaxy fold so this thing was still showing a sign of life earlier I don't think that's gonna happen anymore now so horrible condition guys this thing is bent let's pop it open still snaps open and it does closed but horrible condition and at the end of the day the crazy thing to point out is the iPhone is still showing a sign of life whereas this is not so definitely sucks here let me try hit the power button yep no sign of life here finally guys we got the Nokia 3310 of course we're gonna turn on the camera just to see what happens and we'll see how it survives and if it gets the video footage so same height let's go ahead and do it about 200 feet 20 stories in three two one and look at this guy's the indestructible phone actually got destroyed the battery is missing here the case is basically cracked look at this oh my goodness here's another piece of the Nokia 3310 got the little keyboard here beautiful guys look at this this feels like little LEGO pieces oh my goodness nice little surprise so in conclusion guys that wraps it up we have all the phones here all the little pieces of the Nokia 3310 the Galaxy fold that has no signs of life and then of course the iPhone 11 Pro max which surprisingly is still flashing that green so that's pretty crazy guys that wraps it up for the drop test hope you guys enjoyed this video thanks for watching as always stay tuned for more videos I'll catch you guys in the next one peace out Samsung and Google seem to have had a rocky
relationship over the years. As Samsung grew larger and larger, eventually
becoming the largest Android manufacturer in the world, it began to grow less and less
reliant on Google's services. Sure, Samsung's phones run Android, but Samsung
decided to use their own Tizen OS as opposed to Wear OS on their watches. And picking up a new Galaxy smartphone usually
means being met with two versions of essentially the same app by both companies. Heck, Samsung even has its own Galaxy Store
for apps. But Things seem to be changing though. 2021 marks the year when Samsung and Google
are working closer than ever. Samsung is helping Google on a number of things
that include merging the Tizen OS with wearOS to make Android smartwatches great again. Samsung is also helping Google to make its
first-ever chipset that will go inside the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. Not only that the Google discover feed as
well as Google messages are being integrated into Samsung's One UI software, Samsung is
also integrating Google Nest products into its SmartThings ecosystem and many more. And all of this happened in 2021. And if you were wondering that this relationship
wouldn't get any deeper then think again because Samsung is also helping Google to make their
first foldable smartphone. A brand new report from Korea says that Google
is one of the various Android device makers that are looking to launch foldable phones
by the end of the year. Samsung Display will mass-produce the OLED
panels that Google will use for the Pixel Fold. And not just the foldable panels, Samsung
will also provide ultra-thin glass to Google. This film is applied on top of the display
for added durability. None of the current foldable phones by other
OEMs have Ultra-thin glass including Huawei's Mate X2 which many consider is one of the
best foldable smartphones right now. So the Pixel Fold or whatever Google ends
up calling their foldable phone will offer the same durability that Samsung's top-of-the-line
foldable phones offer. The Korean report says that the Pixel Fold
will have a 7.6" main display that folds inwards and Google will launch the handset in Quarter
4 of 2021. Interestingly, the display analyst Ross Young
says that Google isn't just working on a foldable phone but they will launch a rollable smartphone
as well. But tells not to expect the handset to be
launched this year. And not just Google, China-based manufacturers,
such as Xiaomi and Oppo, are also joining the competition with foldable phones this
year, which is great for the industry as it will allow the component prices to go down
since production will go up and as a result, the prices of foldable phones will come down
which we might see happen with the Galaxy Z Fold 3 that is expected to cost 20% cheaper
than its predecessor. Now coming back to Google, they have left
a comment online that confirms the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro will have their own silicon
as the source code mentions Whitechapel and GS101 which are the codenames for Google silicon. Also, there was confusion as to what graphics
Google would use for their chipset. Turns out, it's Mali GPU the same one that
Samsung uses for the Galaxy S21 lineup. Now it's not clear whether Google will opt
for a 14 core GPU like Samsung or a 24 core Mali G78 GPU like Huawei. I guess we'll have to wait and see. Of course, with that said do consider subscribing
for all the latest tech news and as always I'll see you tomorrow...Peace out [Music] first [Music] [Music] hmm i've never felt [Music] watch your back [Music] [Music] me [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] uh i love everything fire spreading all around [Music] but that's all right [Music] bye Hello and welcome.  Over the past decade, the performance of smartphone
camera has improved immensely, changing the way we take pictures forever. To make mobile image sensor even better than
it already is, Samsung continues to push innovation through
'higher resolutions' and 'multiple cameras'. Today I'm proud to introduce ISOCELL JN1, the industry's first mass produced 50MP image sensor with 0.64μm pixels. Up until now, the ultra-high resolution was
exclusive to flagships and high-end smartphones. However, this new breakthrough in micro-sized
pixel technology will allow more people to experience awesome details. And now, without further ado, here is ISOCELL JN1, the image sensor built for awesome cameras
everywhere. Hello everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Before we dive further into our latest innovation,
I'd liked to quickly go over what image sensor is and what Samsung has achieved so far. Image sensor is very similar to our eyes. well, retina in our eyes, to be more exact. Like the retina which converts the light received
into neural signals for our brain, image sensor converts the light into digital signals and then
sends it over to a mobile processor. Samsung released its first image sensors in
2002, almost twenty years ago. And since then Samsung has continuously been
at the forefront, pulling the industry forward. The year 2019 was a quite a memorable year for Samsung as we've achieved two technical breakthroughs in mobile image sensor. The industry's highest resolution at 108MP, and the industry's smallest pixel size at 0.7μm. Why is this important? Well because the two achievements show our
ability to integrate more number of pixels while keeping the sensor small enough to fit in a slim device. Even after we have hit our big milestone we
continued forward and broke our own record again with ISOCELL JN1, the industry's first
manufactured 0.64μm image sensor. Thank you Ran for going over the ISOCELL's
path of innovation. Now let's go through some key details of the
new JN1. Recently, more and more smartphones in the high to low range are replacing 8 to 12Mp with super high resolution cameras making 32 to 48MP the new norm. To meet this new demand for small-sized image
sensor with high resolution, ISOCELL JN1 was designed early on with 0.64μm pixels. With 50 million pixels packed in 1/2.76 inch
optical format size, JN1 is arguably the smallest 50 mega-pixel sensor available today. And this makes it highly unique and beneficial in its own way. Currently, 1/2.8 inch optical format size
is the most widely used and preferred size in mobile image sensors. This is because it is well suited for both
front and rear-facing cameras and helps smartphone design to stay slim and sleek. At 1/2.76 inch, JN1 is fully compatible with 1/2.8 inch in size and can fully utilize its camera-related components
such as lens and module. This allows the device manufacturers to upgrade
camera resolution on their devices to 50 mega-pixel with ease. JN1 does not just make the resolution better
but it also make slimmer design possible. Due to its small size, JN1’s camera module
height can be reduced by around 10-percent, when compared to a 48Mp sensor with 
0.7μm pixels. Being compatible with 1/2.8 inch also makes
JN1 a perfect choice for front-facing and all types of rear cameras including wide, ultra-wide, and telephoto. Except for the main wide-camera, sub-cameras
generally use 16Mp resolution or lower sensors due to space
limitations. But with JN1, even the sub-cameras can now
offer higher resolution delivering significant improvements such as 4K video at 60 frame per second and high-zoom ratio without compromising the module height. With such high versatility, ISOCELL JN1 allows the device manufacturers to save engineering and sourcing resources. But making a pixel smaller is a very challenging task. Image sensor needs to capture enough light
with pixels that are approximately 100 times smaller than the average thickness of a human hair. Samsung's answer to this challenge is ISOCELL, a pixel technology developed in 2013. 'ISOCELL' is a compound word made up of 'Isolate' or 'ISO', the standard for light sensitivity, and 'Cell'. ISOCELL adds a barrier around each and every pixel, that brings both crosstalk reduction and charge storage capacity increase by up to 30% each. Recently, ISOCELL was upgraded to version 2.0. The first phase of ISOCELL 2.0 improved the
pixel's light sensitivity by around 15%. For JN1, an enhanced version of ISOCELL 2.0 was
applied adding up to 16% more boost in sensitivity. For brighter and more vivid results, JN1 features
Tetrapixel technology. In day light or outdoors Tetrapixel reorganizes
the color filter array into a traditional RGB format using a re-mosaic algorithm to
produce highly detailed images. In the evening or indoors, Tetrapixel merges
JN1's four pixels to imitate single large 1.28μm pixel for an incredible low light photography. For further improvement in picture quality, ISOCELL JN1 comes with Smart-ISO. Smart-ISO intelligently selects between high and low ISO level according to the illumination of the environment for optimal light-to-electric signal conversion. Generally speaking, many image sensors have high ISO as a single level of amplifier to help brighten up the images. While this may be sufficient in most cases, amplifying the light signal received in a really bright setting may wash out details due to oversaturation. JN1 is able to save more essential details
in bright settings by using low ISO, and produce brighter results in the dark with high ISO. Smart-ISO also comes in handy when in a mixed-light environment. Smart-ISO simultaneously produce two different
readouts, one using low and another with high ISO, and merge them together via mobile processor
to create more perfectly balanced high dynamic range image. Now let's talk about autofocus. When taking pictures of your constantly moving
pet or the fleeting precious moment, there may be nothing more important than a fast auto focus. Phase detection autofocus or PDAF is one of
the most popular auto focusing method used in modern smart phones. Super PD is one of Samsung's auto-focusing
technologies. It has auto-focus optimized micro-lens over
one out of thirty-two pixels to detect and check the difference between
left and right phases to get in focus. For faster focus even in low-light, ISOCELL
JN1 is equipped with upgraded Double Super PD technology. With twice the focusing agent density, Double
Super PD offers the same level of AF performance as Super PD even with about 60% less illumination. To sum up, our new 50MP ISOCELL JN1 is the
first of our upcoming new line-up of 0.64μm sensors. To capture and produce images in a most awesome
way possible, JN1 comes with various advanced sensor technologies including Tetrapixel,
Smart-ISO, and Double Super PD. Being compatible with popular 1/2.8 inch optical
format size, JN1 is our recommended choice for all kinds
of rear and front facing cameras. ISOCELL JN1 is currently in mass production
and new smart phones powered by JN1 may become available in the market
in the 2nd half of this year. And now,
Let's answer some of the questions we've received. Ok, here are the three most asked questions. First question, (Q) Will we see ISOCELL JN1 in the next generation premium devices? Miguel, how about you take this one? A: Well, JN1 is a highly versatile solution
that can be used for and fit into main, sub, and even front cameras. So, yes, you may expect to see JN1 in premium
devices for sub-cameras, but for main rear camera, it may be unlikely as the sensor is
geared more toward the volume zone smart phones. Alright, next one is yours. Q: It's great that 50Mp can snuggly fit into
a smartphone, but wouldn't ISOCELL JN1's small 0.64μm pixel size affect the quality of photos? A: Yes, pixel size does matter when it comes
to quality of photos. But with large-sized pixels, it's almost impossible to increase the resolution as the space available for camera is limited. To deliver small-sized 50Mp image sensor with high color fidelity, we haven't just reduced the size of the pixel
but also significantly diminished optical loss, improved light sensitivity, and reduced
noise through advanced technologies such as ISOCELL 2.0, Tetrapixel and Smart-ISO. Ok last one. Q: When can we expect the image sensor to
have human eye like resolution? …hmm what do you think? A: Well, ISOCELL's ultimate goal is to bring
human eye like resolution and quality to mobile phones. But at current pixel size,
such high resolution would have huge camera bump which would not be pleasing to see or to have. To achieve our goal, we will not only continue
to bring innovations to pixel technology, but also provide a total camera solution with
Corephotonics for an amazing picture quality. Thanks Miguel. Well, I hope we've answered some of the questions
you may have on ISOCELL. Thank you and happy snapping! While we make advancements in ultra-small
pixel technology, we also offer products in big pixel category
as part of our two track strategy. Last February,
we've unveiled our biggest 50MP sensor ISOCELL GN2 with 1.4μm pixels, and today,
ISOCELL JN1. Samsung has made amazing strides in sensor
innovation and will continue to do so. We will be back soon with more 0.64μm sensors
this year, so please stay tuned. Thank you and stay safe.

that Samsung is redesigning or I might say replacing Bixby by an actual 3D model named
Sam in short for Samantha. A lot of you commented yesterday asking whether
or not this thing is actually true? Is Bixby indeed getting replaced by Sam, this
virtual assistant? Well, let me explain. First off, Sam is created by Lightfarm in
collaboration with Cheil, Cheil is a marketing company owned by Samsung. Minutes after photos of Sam were posted it
took over the internet, people started appreciating her looks saying she's attractive, it was
trending on Twitter for hours, and people even made dedicated subreddits for her with
some having over 60K members. And many started calling Sam their ‘waifu’. I don't watch Anime, so I had to look it up,
It basically means who your wife is in the anime world or in other words, an anime character
towards which a person feels attracted. Lightfarm who created this released a statement
that says, "Throughout the process, the team devoted itself to developing realistic materials,
mainly for the character’s hair and clothing, so that Sam appeared aesthetically pleasing. Sam was an incredible partnership between
the Cheil Agency and Lightfarm, and we are thrilled to be part of this project!" Interestingly, Lightfarm took the webpage
down for some reason. Not really sure why, probably it has to do
with people creating not suitable for work meme out of this character. I don't know but a lot of people are saying
that Sam is here to replace Bixby. But if you ask me, I don't think she's real,
it could be just a 3D mascot and not an AI avatar of any sort. Well, that's because Samsung didn't mention
anything about the existence of this, Sam hasn't been used in any commercial products
or advertisement campaigns, nor Samsung has dropped any hints that they’ll be replacing
Bixby. Technically, Sam does exist but in the form
of a technical support chatbot in limited countries such as Belgium as you can see here. Currently, it is in the form of a 2D image
representing the bot. So it's possible this 3D Sam is created by
the imagination of the designer and this isn't an official thing at all. But then again, lightfarm said Cheil is one
of their collaborators for the project. Cheil is an advertising firm under the Samsung
group so I'm not totally ruling out the possibility either. So if this is indeed a real thing and the
possibilities are slim but still if it's real then I don't think it's here to replace Bixby. Instead, it might replace this 2D technical
support chatbot Sam which means even if this turns out to be real, it may not come to our
Samsung smartphones. It's also possible that Samsung may reach
out to lightfarm and announce a partnership and could use this 3D character for their
future advertising videos, and who knows Sam could also end up as one of a Neon character,
an Artificial Human technology, offering real-time interactive conversational experience. So you never know. Until Samsung doesn't come out and say anything
about it, consider it just a 3D mascot. With that said, do consider subscribing for
all the latest tech news and as always I'll see you tomorrow...Peace out hey guys this is a second gentleman so a really good news for those who are eagerly waiting for a fortnight game and this offer is exclusive course absolutely exceeds applies right now so if you want to download the fourth night beta version then you can check it out on description below for now we will talk about the fortnight exclusively for this specific device so all you gotta do is go to Galaxy apps which should be on your device if you haven't time to go exit advise just click on it and as you can see the requirements are the internet itself then your phone should be answered by pointer or higher ram 3gb or higher and the model number that supports is sam tsui SES 7s 8's nine notes eighth notes nine teves three tab as for [Music] you you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] hello yeah uh you guys are just being stupid idiots you're sucking samsung's cover [ __ ] get your head out of your perfect pink [ __ ] this is just a corporate scam to get you to buy samsung Samsung’s Galaxy S21 is a solid step above the S20 
based purely on specs. Between the flagship-level   power, bigger battery, there’s a lot to like.
However, one major change that has drawn attention   and a fair share of criticism is the company’s 
decision to adopt a plastic build — similar to   its Galaxy A series — instead of the metal 
and glass design seen on the S21 Ultra   and every flagship Galaxy S phone since the 
Galaxy S6. Plastic has traditionally been   viewed as the material of choice for budget phones 
because of its cheap material cost. As a result,   many associate the look and feel of 
plastic with cheap phones — or even   plastic toys — rather than a premium device.
It doesn’t help that basically, every top-tier   smartphone brand shifted to glass designs 
long ago — Apple, Huawei, OnePlus, Google,   the list goes on. This includes OEMs like 
Realme that make affordable flagships that   are almost half the price of the Galaxy S21.
Now if you're wondering that this would change   with the upcoming Galaxy S22 then you'd be 
disappointed because as per a new report out   of South Korea, the Galaxy S22 Ultra 
will be the only S22 handset to offer   a premium glass build. This means both the Galaxy 
S22 and S22+ will have a plastic build. 
  Honestly, this is ridiculous. With the S21 
series, only the vanilla S21 offered a plastic   back while both the Plus and Ultra had a 
premium glass build. But now it's getting   worse with the S22 as the Plus variant 
also joins the cheap material group.
  I really don't understand why Samsung is so opt to 
reduce the premiumness of their flagship lineup.   If this was an industry-wide phenomenon then 
it would have made some sense but the fact that   almost every other OEM uses premium material 
on their premium phones makes this feel like   Samsung is cutting back purely to snatch a 
higher profit margin. I mean every iPhone   released last year including a $399 iPhone SE had 
a glass back. Heck, even OnePlus offered glass   back on both the OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro. 
Some of you would say that you use a case   on the phone anyway, so it’s not like you’ll be 
touching the back of the phone in everyday usage.   Well, true but that shouldn't be an excuse to go 
cheap on the materials since there are millions   who use their phones without a cover on them. 
So it's high time Samsung should stop putting   cheap materials on their flagship phones just for 
the sake of increasing their profit margins. 
  Thankfully, the report mentions Samsung 
is yet to make a final decision,   but I would suggest don't count on them. 
Anyway, a couple of days ago there was a report   that the production of the Galaxy S21 FE has 
been halted, which means the launch could either   get delayed or the product would be canceled 
altogether. Turns out it's not getting canceled.   According to a new report from Korea, Samsung 
has delayed the S21 FE's launch to late September   or early October. They mentioned two reasons 
for this. A) Global chip shortage and B) to   focus on the marketing of the Galaxy Z Fold 3 
and the Z Flip 3. Apparently, Samsung doesn't   want to distract consumer attention by 
launching a bar-shaped smartphone as they   are betting big on foldable phones this year. 
Interestingly Max Winbech said the Unpacked Event   for the foldables will take place on August 
3rd but Korea Herald says that's not true. It   will be held at a later date but they didn't 
mention the date. but considering Samsung's   Unpacked events for the second half of the year 
usually happen on Fridays, so the announcement   date could be August 6 or August 13.
With that being said, do consider subscribing   for all the latest tech news and as always

been designed with the next normal in mind to power how we work and how we play and while each of these devices are great on their own they are even more powerful as a part of the full samsung galaxy ecosystem samsung member i'm posting so many comments live right now it's hard to follow but i'm so pleased that you share our excitement and i can tell you really want to see the new devices so everyone out there let me start by introducing the all-new galaxy note 20. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] wow there it is the galaxy note 20. note users have always been energized by work and inspired by play now that the division between work and play is boring more than ever we need to move fluidly between the two note 20 was designed to meet this need and support us in our daily lives it's a new and improved way to optimize time and maximize efficiency the new galaxy note 20 comes in two versions the note 20 and the note 20 ultra with everything we do on our phones these days the display is really important the note 20 has a 6.7 inch screen and the note 20 ultra has a largest smartphone display yet in our note series at 6.9 inches the display is the most vivid and brightest you can find on a smartphone today it gives great visibility indoors and outdoors we've seen your testimonies that no matter how you use your smartphone once you experience the buttery smoothness of our 120 hertz display it's really hard to go back we're proud to bring that same experience to the note 20 ultra and considering how much you'll be using it we're happy to protect the new note with the toughest glass ever on a smartphone the note can keep up with busy multitasking lifestyles it delivers the best of power and the best of productivity note 20 and note 20 ultra have the fastest processors in the galaxy series advanced chipsets combined with our all-day intelligent battery give you the power to last and if you're ever running low you can get more than 50 charged in just 30 minutes that's staying power you can count on we also offer end-to-end security in hardware and software with samsung knox if you think about everything that we do on our phones it's reassuring to know cameras are an integral part of the smartphone experience for me my gallery has replaced my diary i use pictures to remember where i went who i met and even what i ate i know a lot of you can relate we expect our phones to do a lot and note 20 cameras are designed to live up to these high expectations they come with one camera on the front and three in the back ultra wide wide and telephoto you can get sharp pictures even when the subject is far away and crisp shots in low light it's the biggest sleep in low light photography in a galaxy and as you can see the bold design is a proud declaration on its own the note 20 ultra has it all beautiful widescreen powerful performance and outstanding camera they come together to deliver a fluid experience that opens up new possibilities for work and play when our invite and teaser videos dropped a few weeks ago we were amazed by all the buzz about note 20. these are some of the comments we received wow some of you guys guessed a lot of the details we noticed design garnered a lot of interest and it looks like mystic bronze will be the must-have color we asked our designers to share a sneak peek into their process let's take a look design is one and the one is a combination of everything [Music] design is a problem-solving process with rational and critical thinking samsung design put consumer at the center all the time we always try to understand their needs and address their problem with methodized process we are not in the edge of single genius we believe in democratization of design process which is cross-functional collaboration so the main concept of note 20 design is a sustainable premium which means long-lasting elegance neither trendy nor fleeting we have studied on hate for four to five years for the perfect quality mr bronze was the best color to harmonize with his effect and it is gender fluid and sustainable as well the mystic bronze of note 20 and the note 20 ultra look the same feel the same but they're different materials made with contrasting methods for the note 20 ultra we etched the glass to create a satin finish for the note 20 on the other hand we applied a special coating onto reinforced polycarbonate to realize the same look and feel this way within a single series we deliver the values of both premium and pragmatism in addition to mystic bronze we settled on mystic white mystic gray mystic black and mystic green we always observe listen and adapt ourselves to what are happening in our society because we believe designer is not a trend follower but we are culture creator [Music] you just saw how passionate our designers are creating products that address the needs of consumers in this fast changing world i love how they keep up with real world changes and the real people who use our products at heart that's what the note is all about our friends at netflix helped us get a glimpse of what life would be like without it busy trying to be doesn't look like you are what are you doing looking for a ham sandwich i left [Music] i don't know don't speak that either they can't understand you mike you're breaking up spiking you copy and you're cutting out my dustin what a delightful waste of time i needed shock i need awe and i needed a pdf because my computer doesn't have work 2020 is a year of change so far it hasn't been easy that's why we designed the note 20 to empower users and of course this is here to help that's right it's the s pen the s pen defines the note experience our engineers have continuously improved and developed it to put more power at your fingertips here's how [Music] [Music] galaxy note and s-pen were born to respond to users needs we knew people would want a large screen smartphone with a pen inside because they are watching more online video than ever before as engineers our job was to realize this vision through intensive research and development and so in 2011 tasks of smartphones and the mobile tablet in one device created a new category of fablet over the past nine years the s pen has been reimagined as a truly powerful device in the early years of its development we wanted to keep satisfying those who say that i like writing with the s pen so our primary goal was to provide a better feel to the writing and achieved improved recognition but if you've been watching how it's developed since then you will know it's no ordinary digital pen we introduced air view which enables the viewing of additional content by hovering the s pen over the screen the l command gave an instant reading of available tasks while the smart select received much praise for providing more freedom in doing screen captures we also added a translation feature which students really loved and there's action link that turned handwritten notes into action for immediate use but still we received feedback saying i draw a line but it appears too slowly it was a perceptive observation that gave us a real jolt that kind of latency is created as the pen signal is picked up by the handset processed by the software and then finally drawn on the screen one of many solutions was the ai-based point prediction we had our system analyzed tens of millions of writing and drawing samples much more than before based on this the device predicts the next expected point of the s pen since the predicted point should be closer to the real next point than the last point the process can contribute to decreasing the latency also thanks to a doubling of the display's refresh rate to 120 hertz the note 20 screen now shows the data from the s pen twice as frequently as the note 10. in the end we reduce the latency to 9 milliseconds moving the s pen one step closer to the natural feeling of writing on paper handwriting on a digital screen was not a common thing 10 years ago but now it has become a common experience i think galaxy note and s pen set a kind of new normal and thank you so much [Music] it is amazing what this pen can do the s-pen has always been an integral part of our galaxy ecosystem and the natural pen experience travel far beyond note 20. we are entering a new area where the boundaries between work and play are fluid and some of us are already there our next device is all about giving you the flexibility you deserve it will help you to be more productive at work but also nourish your passion for play and this is our all-new galaxy tab s7 [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] and here it is the tub s7 i'm really excited for you to discover its full potential it represents a substantial leap from the previous generations and here is adrian to tell you more hi everyone all around the world people are talking about the new normal we know it can be a challenge but i'm grateful i have the tools to adapt to the times and focus on what's important to me being home means i decide when to speed up for work and when to slow down for so many time tab s7 makes that possible it's the ultimate productivity device that gives me the power to optimize my personal time it's perfect for me and for anyone else who wants to work and play more efficiently tab s7 comes in two sizes an 11 inch model and the larger 12.4 inch tab s7 plus the tab s7 plus has the largest super amoled on a tablet today and remember that ultra smooth 120 hertz display we're bringing it to tablets for the first time tab s7 has the most advanced display among tablets offering brighter crisper images than ever before when it comes to design our goal was to combine portability and style despite the full metal design it's very lightweight look at it from the side impressive right in fact the tab s7 plus is the slimmest tablet of its size on the market it's incredibly thin light and durable the tab s7 and s7 plus come in three new color options including you guessed it this year's signature mystic bronze you might be thinking looks great no where's the s-pen here it is convenient right we also built a better keyboard that's going to raise your productivity gain now let's see what this tab can do we know a lot of people are juggling work and home life these days so being able to multitask has become essential we've had multi-window on or tablets for years offering a split screen experience and now we're letting you run up to three apps simultaneously this means while drawing or taking notes you can watch videos on youtube and chat with friends all at the same time and of course we continue to give galaxy users ad free access to youtube premium now let's get back to the s pen this feels like a real pen and writes like one too combining the new s pen with the new 120 hertz display we were able to significantly reduce latency it's the biggest leap in s pen responsiveness yet a complete s pen makeover that feels smooth and natural the book cover keyboard is the most versatile keyboard for both work and play it's going to raise your productivity game like never before it clicks into place securely and when you're not typing away you can use it as a stand to watch your favorite netflix shows and adjust it to a range of angles for more flexibility what i really love about the keyboard are the touchpad and shortcuts the touchpad is now larger and supports multi-finger gestures so it's easier to control your screen and it has shortcuts like on a full-size keyboard bringing a windows pc experience to an android tablet all these innovations start by listening carefully to you or users so let's take a moment to hear from one of our samsung members hey everybody my name is chris and i'm from the united states what i love most about the s-pen is that when paired with galaxy the possibilities of creation are endless i really want to know if samsung has plans to add more cool features to the s pen a great question and one we've heard a lot more than one million apps are optimized for android tablets and we're seeing increased demand for more s pen compatible apps as well here is the good news tab s7 now comes preloaded with three great apps note shelf which is great for note taking canva for designing and clip studio paint for drawing clip studio paint is coming to android for the first time on tab s7 and we're super excited for you to try it out [Music] flap your hand cross it with your left arm [Music] we also enhanced our samsung notes app to let you do even more with the s pen let's bring mary back to talk about that hi mary hey adrian as you know samsung notes is the original app that was created to work with the s pen for the note series it's been there from the very beginning and we've been improving it for every generation of the notes since why don't we show them sure let's start with something simple and then build up i have the samsung notes app open here i'll pull up a pdf it's a bit hard to read that here let me straighten it out oh that was korean yeah i've been taking classes the samsung notes app has been great for me because i can type my notes and write directly on them with the s pen i can also use voice recording so i can remember exactly what my teacher was saying as i was taking notes and you know what's really cool show us it syncs as i type and write on the screen so if i hit play you will see my notes syncing with the audio and if i tap on a specific part of the note the recording jumps to that audio bookmark here let me show you we'll walk through the steps together as most of you probably know this is a common greeting in korea i'll be at your office on wednesday at 10 a.m cool right that is really cool and everything adrian just showed us also works on the note 20. it's incredibly convenient that the app works through the cloud and you can open and edit all your notes on any galaxy device phone tablet or pc and this is not just for notes you can sync your devices so you never miss a call or text no matter what device you're using or how far away you are from your phone this is the value of the galaxy ecosystem you can create a continuous workspace wherever you go for maximum convenience and productivity we're expanding this ecosystem even further with their partners at microsoft making the phone windows 10 pc experience as seamless as possible that's right we announced our partnership with microsoft at last year's unpacked and we've been working very closely with the team since and now we're ready to present some cool new features let's ask philip from microsoft to show us how it all works hey thanks mary last year we announced that we'd be working together to help you our customers be productive

them across your devices we're continuing to expand our integration across samsung and microsoft experiences to bring your phone and pc closer together so imagine you're on your brand new galaxy note 20 and you get an idea for a project the samsung notes app and the s pen make it really easy to sketch out a design and write a quick note if you get a text message like this one and you want to respond a little bit later your note 20 makes it really easy to send a reminder just to click and same thing here if you get a call and you want to respond later not only can you send a reminder you can also shoot a quick note back later when you're on your pc if you wanted to access your notes and reminders you might have to email yourself or connect your devices with a usb cable that's why i'm excited to announce that we're making your notes and reminders easily accessible and in some of your favorite microsoft apps on your computer for example by syncing your samsung notes with your onenote feed your hand drawn sketch on your galaxy note 20 will be available in different pc experiences like outlook on the web from here sharing your idea is as easy as copying and pasting your reminders will also become easier to access across your devices by syncing samsung reminder with microsoft to do your reminders will show up on your pc and the to-do app teams and also here and

your tasks where you can return that missed call or jump back into a web page the same way you would on your phone and when you check off a task because there's a two-way sync it checks it off in samsung reminder as well last year we announced the integration of link to windows and the quick panel of galaxy phones to link your devices with a click after you're linked the your phone app gives you access to your notifications messages photos and calls on your galaxy note 20 but now that your phone app is about to get even better i'm excited to announce the new apps feature which gives you access to your android apps on your note 20 directly from your pc now you'll be able to combine the benefits of running a mobile app on your galaxy note 20 like the familiar look and feel and not

lot with that well let me show you a clip we made with the upgraded pro video mode just quickly connect to the tv there we are and you see wow that looks even better on a large screen i can't believe that was taken on a phone by the way i noticed you use samsung dex i love that it now connects wirelessly i connect my tab to my tv often too yeah and now i can use my phone while using my tv as a

powerful hardware with intelligent software and we can't wait for you to try them out for yourselves [Music] you have seen all the amazing things you can do with the note 20 and tab seven from productivity to gaming to viewing but audio is important too this will give you a whole new level of experience you have seen a tremendous increase in interest for wireless earphones which are a must have now whenever you're listening to music on a conference call or talking to friends you need the flexibility to juggle all the parts of your busy life our galaxy buds are already exceptional but we wanted to introduce a new form factor that help you to tune into life a unique design matched with awesome sounds listen [Music] shake me away bring me back to reality [Music] [Applause] oh wow that looks so beautiful don't you guys think i wonder what's inside the galaxy buds live they look larger than life there but the case is actually super small it fits right in the palm of my hand or in my pocket see doesn't it look like a little jewelry box i love it the buds come in a choice of three colors including the super chic mystic bronze which i am personally loving and they are going to look fabulous with the note 20 or tab seven the buds live are also eco-friendly which is amazing right both the buds and the case are made of recycled materials and to top it off you can jazz it up with a ton of colors and accessories to personalize it now here they are in the case don't they look super chic and they should look great because we noticed more and more people keep their buds in throughout the day that's also why we designed the buds live for all day comfort it took a ton of research and so many prototypes but the good news is the result is the first open type buds in the galaxy series now all you have to do is the wing tips face up just like this and they fit perfectly in the curve of my ear when i put them in they rest really lightly and securely and it doesn't feel like i'm wearing ear plugs which is the worst even better you don't have that awkward stem sticking out they look pretty fabulous truly one of a kind another great thing is when i'm running from one thing to the next i don't want to have to worry about my battery do you in fact i get up to six hours of play time and the charging case provides up to 21 hours in total my buds live can keep up with me all day and longer oh and the controls are easy and even customizable so you know your favorite spotify playlist it's just now to tap away you don't have to reach for your phone anymore best of all buds live have incredible high sound quality with powerful bass boost it sounds like you're in a room together just you and your favorite band hanging out buds i bring you close to the optimal sound of the harman curve and for all you autophiles out there you know what that means now you're going to love the active noise cancellation for opentype it's a first in our bud series it lets you tune in without tuning out so you can get lost in your favorite podcast but you won't miss your subway stop because you'll be able to hear all those announcements really clearly this is possible because we cut low band background noise by up to 97 that means it drowns out the sounds you don't want to hear and picks up the sounds you do buzz live provide the best call quality too with three microphones and a voice pickup unit if i get a call while i'm out and about and it's really really loud the mics will minimize the noise outside so i can be heard more clearly now check this out we compared buds live with a pair of wireless earphones from another company both recordings were made under the exact same conditions can you hear me if you can this is bud's life if you can't it's not can you hear me if you can this is bad slide if you can't it's not you can totally hear the difference right when it comes to reducing noise buzz live they're the clear winner and they play really well with the other galaxy devices in our ecosystem if you're making videos with your note 20 the microphones on your buds live can give you exceptional sound quality my favorite though it enhances your viewing experience you know sometimes you're watching something and you're just dying to share it with a friend but sharing your buds well it's kind of a bummer because you get half the sound and you don't get that immersive experience you love the galaxy ecosystem has a solution mary come come let's show them how it works here you go thank you uh but my butts are already connected to my note oh no problem i'm gonna just do a few little taps here it says play that's mine yeah and then good now let me show you what i've been watching these days hopefully you'll dig it as well oh wow that's really loud and scary oh no problem i can turn down the volume on both our buds at the same time just like this let's see much better that's really convenient i know right i think that's it do you want to continue to watch that's it yeah it sure is all right thank you i think [Music] hey i'm on my way [Music] street [Music] okay i have one more thing for you and you are going to love this let me start

this ergonomic design fit comfortably in your pocket i'm turning it on now after we launched the first galaxy fold users told us they used the front screen as much as the inner wider screen we listened and adapted the new z-fold 2 sports a wider 6.2 inch full cover display with no compromises so even when it's closed you have a full smartphone experience open the device and you can access an even more immersive viewing experience we've maximized the screen with our hole in display technology bringing our infinity old display to the z-fold 2 across a beautiful 7.6 inches of course the z-fold 2 embodies our 120 hertz refresh rate technology and additional upgrades we optimize the display layers reinforce the entire structure to make the phone tougher in real world environments now let's take a look the galaxy z fold 2 has the most advanced flexible display ever giving you an immersive theater an epic game room and a creative work studio all in one delivering an uninterrupted viewing experience and whether you're working or playing games on the 5g network the dual intelligent battery will last all day now the display is only part of what makes the fold experience possible we completely re-engineered the hinge of the z-fold too to improve resilience so you can use it with crater confidence in its durability we want to show you how we designed the z-fold 2 and insiders gave us a deep dive look the galaxy fold series introduced a whole new category of smartphones and is pioneering the foldable experience and here is where it all began we started this research and work when we were working on the note back in 2011 people wanted a device that could deliver a completely immersive and viewing experience but still portable in the panel of their hands is it ever possible to meet both needs it's possible if you fold the smartphone so in 2019 the launch of the galaxy fall changed the shape of the future but what about this flood of questions unleashed with it worth all the height okay let's search out the answers one by one make a folding phone you need something other than glass so you have plastic on this outside so of course glass doesn't fold well that is common sense but this glass can be folded we call it utg it's 100 glass but it's processed to be extremely thin how thin thinner than a human hair the utg on z full two makes seeing and touching the screen more pleasurable but this display requires both strength and flexibility at the same time striking a balance between these two different qualities is no easy task the solution was to optimize the formation of the display layers for the z-fold too we rearranged the physical interaction between the soft layers and the rigid layers to give it enhanced strength then we optimized the property and thickness of the adhesive so the display would remain flexible even in low or high temperatures after rigorous tests the z-fold twos display is now ready to provide a premium look and upgraded usability but for a display like this to open and close properly you need a pretty complicated mechanism this hinge too is constantly being improved it has a more firm snap to placing it flat and then unsnapping it from flat you can stand it up like this in this thing they call flex mode what will the next one be like [Music] we designed the z-fold ii to stay open at multiple angles like the z-flip what makes this possible is the cam mechanism here's how it works this is a cam these two ridge shaped pieces slide up and down against each other and the friction created here allows the device to freestand at different angles together with larger screens the new hinge creates many new user scenarios z-flip is long and narrow while z-fold 2 is large and wide a larger and more solid display needs even stronger power in the hinge to create that strength we decided to double up the cam and elastic components including the cam there are over 60 components in the hinge all moving in unison but for them to have space to move there must be a gap ben so if you get this phone it might be a good idea to vacuum out your pockets every morning before you put on your pants [Music] to sweep away these worries we tried out over a hundred different ideas the 99th try gave us a starting point for a solution and on the 108th try we invented what we now call the sweeper interestingly enough we got the idea from a vacuum cleaner commercial we found out these machines use bristles made up of carbon and nylon fibers and can rotate 20 times per second for two years these fibers were elastic and durable enough to be placed under the hinge sweeping through it with every move thanks to the upgraded cutting technology the sweeper became even smaller in the z-fold too the moment all these innovations come together is when it's finally in the user's hands providing a whole new experience along with strength and a sense of security we encountered our share of challenges but always kept moving forward as a result we created the next great leap in mobile technology trust me we'll be unfolding many more innovations in this category so stay tuned the z-fold 2 boasts the most advanced mechanism for folding technology we are proud pioneers in this category and we will never stop making it better when it comes to what you can achieve on the z-fold 2 this is just the tip of the iceberg we've got so much more to tell you about this amazing device we're going to share more details on september 1st we've been working hard collaborating with partners and listening to our users to bring whole new experiences to life for the z-fold too so remember september 1st pre-orders begin on that day too but there's more earlier this year we partnered with renowned designer tom brown to combine the creative vision of the fashion house with the innovative technology of galaxy we're excited to continue this collaboration unveiling the next step of our partnership [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] and this is the beautiful outcome of a great partnership it combines the elegance of design with the power of technology and there you have it five new products designed to help you sail through everyday life and navigate the next normal our new products embody our mission to bring delightful experience to life at the same time we remain fully committed to 5g and foldables and will work to maintain our status as forerunners in these two areas going forward 5g and foldable will be the major pillars of samsung future [Music] yes [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] we have discussed opportunities of what technology can do for you and i know you have a lot of questions so let's bring back tien as president of samsung mobile he is in the best position to take questions about galaxy vision for the future hi tiam and welcome back thank you we have introduced five amazing products today and i love we have so much to offer however some people have asked why we are releasing multiple products can you explain our strategy to everyone watching thanks for asking the question federico our customers and employees inspire me daily to think bigger and move beyond what's expected we all have different needs and those needs require different devices our product line is about consumer choice that's especially important now when everyone is relying on mobile technology to stay connected our goal with all of our products is to help make consumers lives better to make everything they do easier faster and more fun and what's really great too is all of our devices work seamlessly together i agree jim it's all about meeting the diverse needs of people around the world let's move on to the next questions i love the galaxy note series amazing features amazing power and the devices really speak for themselves but on that point we presented two amazing galaxy note 20s today but if i'm a consumer how do i decide between the two models it's tough decision there is so much to love about these phones for long time not fans who want the absolute best in a powerpoint the galaxy note 20 ultra is unmatched it's designed for power users who demand the most powerful experience that's why i call it the note 20 ultra for anyone new to the galaxy note community the galaxy note 20 will give them the core note features to power their work and play experiences no matter which version you choose they are both great either way it will be the best productivity tool for you that's an excellent summary of how i feel i think they're both terrific options and i can't wait to start using mine i'd like also to talk about the galaxy z42 i'm excited to see how the refined engineering will offer the next generation of foldable experiences and i'm sure this will be a hit but some people are wondering why we didn't include that s-pen and we really talked a lot about internally didn't we yes yes we did the s-pen has always been a well-loved feature of the galaxy note and we are happy to hear people want it so much they even want it on the fold for galaxy default 2 we made sure it has its own special qualities that make it exclusive and best suited to the foldable category this device is unlike anything else on the market and the user experience is one of kind from the backless cover display to an unfolded immersive viewing experience to the flex mode it will provide a transformative experience and we will certainly continue to listen to our customers feedback so please stay tuned for what the future will hold and is a certain exciting prospect to see how the future will unfold switching topics let's talk about privacy this is a fundamental value that we keep top of mind in our day-to-day business and it's something we discuss all the time do you want to share your thoughts of course privacy starts with a trust you have to trust your hardware you have to trust your software proper trust to work you need to have security security is a top priority for samsung from the second we start planning a new device to the final product security is included in every step of the development process to give you proactive always own protection simply put there is no such thing as data privacy without security we have a responsibility to protect our customers devices and of course the data that's on them and that's exactly what we're doing last but not least in a recent blog post you talked about samsung's responsibility to make a world a better place could you tell us more about what you mean i do feel like this is a responsibility for samsung consider the fandemie we knew we could help so we put our expertise and resources to work where we could make the biggest impact we helped factories increase production of masks and test keys we also donated smartphones and tablet for remote learning another important example is the samsung global course app where we match process it's a joint effort with the undp to raise awareness and support for the 17 global goals more than 45 million galaxy users have this app on their phone that's triple the number of app downloads since february by taking small actions together we can make the world a better place for all thank you uh you know babe you'd be shocked at how fast things are coming along here perfect my boss is coming for dinner

they're just getting free publicity from this company normally companies would pay millions upon millions of dollars for this kind of publicity but then again i don't know if they really want the publicity of everybody simpin over a samsung girl but you know what if i was ceo i'd be all for it bro damn what is that i'm done bro all right guys if you enjoyed this video and want to watch more of me reacting to stupid tick tocks of down bad people tap here because i have a lot of those videos how's that sound oh it's my listen to this even my coke was screaming for hey andrew here for mynextender.com today with an unboxing of the brand new samsung galaxy tab a7 lite let's get started alright let's start the unboxing of the samsung galaxy tab a7 lite that's available in germany where i am right now in the us it's starting at 159 so this is quite an inexpensive tablet inside the box we get the tablet first and it looks very similar to the bigger galaxy tab a7 it has a mostly metal back feels quite nice then we get a usbc cable the charger of course is included as well and then like the paper stuff like warranty card and so on and an sd card eject tool and if you have the lte version which is available i'm sure you can change the sim card with that tool as well alright as usual since i shot the first part of this video a couple of hours have passed already i ran a couple of benchmarks and played with this tablet a bit so that i can tell you a bit more about the galaxy tab a7 lite and we're starting with the design first of all this is an 8.7 inch tablet which is quite an unusual size usually we get 8 inch tablets we had 8.4 inch already and 7.9 inch tablets 8.7 is very new i like that the screen bezel here on the side is quite slim so you can actually still hold it with one hand i don't have a particularly big hands they're relatively small even i would say and yeah i can hold it um quite nicely like this which you will want to do if you're reading a book or something the bezels on the top and bottom are a bit bigger we don't have any physical buttons of course but there's a two megapixel uh camera on the front and you can use that camera to unlock the tablet using facial recognition so i quickly demonstrate that it works quite well especially in good light but it won't be as secure as apple's face id because there's no additional sensor then we go to the back of the tablet and we get a mostly metal back at least i'm pretty sure this is metal but we have plastic parts on the top and bottom and this design looks quite similar to the bigger galaxy tab a7 which i have here and it's the same basic design but of course you can see um one is much smaller this is the galaxy tab a7 light it's eight millimeters thin and weighs 366 grams so let's go around the tab a little bit we've got a power button volume rockers on the bottom we've got a standard headphone jack and which is not that common anymore and then there's a usbc 2.0 port that means you can't attach an external monitor or so but most usb c accessories will work then we get a speaker on this side and a speaker on this side so we've got a real stereo separation and in fact the sound quality is pretty good i was surprised actually of how good the sound of this tablet is for this size and this price the sound is really nice of course nothing compared with an ipad pro of course but it's much much cheaper then we've got a micro sd card slot over there and that's it about the design now let's look at the 8.7 inch screen um colors look nice it's quite bright and viewing angles are decent too nothing to complain here one downside and at least kind of a downside is the resolution though it's 1340 by 800 pixels and on an 8.7 inch screen that means it has the same pixel density as a standard eight inch screen within standard hd resolution and that means that text don't look super sharp um it's just an hd resolution basically on eight inches which is not crazy high at all it's usable i think it's okay but certainly not great and if you're using a kind of up-to-date smartphone even if you're using a cheap up-to-date smartphone that one will be much sharper and i think a comparison is fair because eight inches you will hold them closer to your face than a 10 inch tablet so yeah not so sharp as green but other aspects of the screen are pretty good now one downside is that you can't watch netflix in hd resolution and has a wide van level of s3 only and that means you can only watch netflix with standard resolution now since the screen resolution here is not that high anyways it's not that big of a deal you're not missing out too much but it's still a bummer on the other hand the lenovo tab m8 which is the direct competitor has the same problem i'm sure you will ask me if i can use the s pen on this screen and no the s pen is not supported this is the s pen of the galaxy tab a7 but all s-pens are interchangeable and yeah it does not work so this is not a tablet for note-taking if you're looking for a great tablet for note-taking or for drawings and so on you have to check out the apple ipad mini or the samsung galaxy tab active3 at least if you're looking for an 8-inch tablet for note-taking inside the samsung galaxy tab a7 lite sets the mediatek helio p22 processor with three gigabytes of ram and 32 gigabyte of internal storage and out of those 12.6 gigabytes are used by this system already for glt is an option as well you can see my geekbench 5 comparison here which is quite interesting because the performance is noticeably better than on the lenovo tab m8 and amazon fire hd8 and hd8 plus which are both direct competitors a little bit cheaper but still direct competitors however the bigger galaxy tab a7 is noticeably faster too and the apple ipad mini and the samsung galaxy tab active 3 are much faster than the galaxy tab a7 lite so this is clearly an entry level tablet and certainly not suited if you're looking for a high performing device and that's what my little gaming test shows i played this game called ronin it's a samurai game and it runs fine but it is a simple game this is certainly not a great fortnite tablet or so it's for basic simpler games only a bit of multitasking is possible actually you can see me running here youtube on one side and google chrome on the other and i'm surfing the web a bit and that works fine but still especially when closing apps or switching between apps you certainly will feel that this is not crazy snappy you will have to wait a couple of seconds sometimes that's because it's an entry-level tablet and it really can't compete with high-end devices like the ipad mini or the galaxy tab active 3 which is the only 8-inch high-end android tablet right now this is certainly entry-level what's certainly not entry-level is the software though because it's running android 11 out of the box um so the pretty yeah most recent version basically android 11 with one ui 3.1 just like the other up-to-date samsung tablets and um then are not that many customizations of course there's the standard samsung one ui stuff but besides that they're only a couple of apps pre-installed basically the ones from google like chrome youtube and so on then there are some samsung apps like their own contacts the galaxy shop you can install many more samsung apps when first starting this tablet but i wouldn't recommend it unless you are a huge samsung panel so otherwise just get your apps from the google play store the samsung notes app is pre-installed but like i said it does not support the s pen then you also get netflix spotify youtube music and i installed the benchmark and ronin the game myself so the software is not that overloaded at all it's actually quite lightweight all right my first impressions of the samsung galaxy tab a7 lite is pretty good it's not totally amazing because this is just not the fastest most powerful tablet out there but it seems to be a decent lower end maybe kind of mid-range tablet but mostly lower-end tablet i like the 8-inch form factor a lot and i will certainly use it as my reading device and my surfing device for a bit um yeah it will take me a couple of weeks to fully test this tablet play more games just use it more outside especially um yeah but my first impressions are okay it's certainly better than the lenovo tab m8 because it's just running more up-to-date software and it's a bit snappier faster and yeah it's also a bit pricier than the lenovo tab m8 and pricier than the amazon fire hd 8 series so if you're looking for a super cheap tablet um especially check out the amazon 8-inch tablets but yeah if you're a samsung fan if you're looking to upgrade your galaxy tab a8.0 from i believe 2019 and then you should certainly check out the galaxy tab a7 especially in europe there haven't been many eight inch tablets recently if you're from the united states you should compare it with other eight-inch samsung tablets all right um if you have any questions please write them in the comments because i will certainly read all the comments before i do my final review so if you want me to check out something in particular try something in particular just write it down there all right that's been on my unboxing of the samsung galaxy tab a7 lite um yeah i will see you next time it's been 10 years android and i had a healthy happy relationship we whined we dined we we did everything together but six months ago we agreed to start seeing other people too yeah i switched to an iphone and i feel like it's finally time to to pop the big question do i regret it and i must have thanks to surfsharkvpn for making this possible so at the time when i switched i was moving from a samsung galaxy s20 ultra to an iphone 11 pro max and so my very very first thoughts were one the cameras are kind of boring having come from samsung and huawei phones which have astrophotography modes and 108 megapixel sensors and 100 times zoom cameras i noticed immediately that yes the iphone was good but it was also just a little sterile in comparison i really missed having a 120hz refresh rate the iphone just didn't feel as snappy or as immediate by comparison and three i specifically remember the moment i'd finished setting up the home screen of my iphone and i was taking a look at it thinking well i guess that's kind of it then there's no eye compacts or deep customization to experiment with this was probably going to be my setup for as long as i used an iphone bit of a bummer now six months have passed since then i've had time to properly test abs we've had the new ios 14 we've had a model upgrade from the 11 pro max to the 12 pro max and whilst i would say that at its core none of these three things have been fixed my opinion about them has changed for example i still wish we had more camera features here but at the same time i am starting to appreciate that what you do get is super reliable i used to actually have a bit of a force of habit where when i was taking a portrait mode shot i would take like six or seven photos just to make sure i have a good one i stopped doing that now i take one maybe two because i trust it or fun fact these iphone 12s are the first time that we've ever used iphones to film parts of these videos nobody's noticed i mean sure it might become obvious if i told you exactly which shots but the point is it might not if i didn't and subtle point this one picks up voices better than any other phone i've tried it sounds good right and the other thing is that depending on which cameras you're recording on the microphones on this phone change how they pick up the audio like when you're shooting something in front of you it'll use this microphone here and then when you switch to the front camera it'll change to the front microphone plus even when you're just taking photos this is far from the most exciting spec sheet it's just three 12 megapixel cameras but i've taken some awesome shots on it day or night or ultrawide or zoom this is solid all-round if you did see my full camera comparison recently you'll have seen how within two years apple's gone from bottom of the pack at night mode photos to pretty much the best you can get the only times it's let me down is in those awkward middle indoor lighting situations like when i'm taking night mode shots i'm usually capturing static things like buildings or roads but in those indoor settings trying to take photos of people and cats it doesn't capture quite as fast as my old huawei for example so motion can be blurred okay hardware i still miss 120 hours displays i feel like that's one thing that a 2020 flagship phone should have but apart from that almost every other part of the hardware of this iphone and even the last iphone are top shelf like i still don't think these iphone 12 phones are particularly nice to hold thanks to these sharp edges but wow were they durable this is actually the first phone that i've ever used without a case i've actually dropped it twice and both times i kind of froze on the spot nearly had a heart attack slowly kind of crept forward and picked it up but it was fine i haven't got a single scratch on this iphone 12 pro max yet or we've got speakers i was already perfectly satisfied with the sound quality i was getting on my samsung but the iphone 12 pro max is probably the second best sounding phone i've ever heard second only to the asus rog phone 3 and that thing's just a monster but i think the biggest hardware change moving from android to iphone is that when you're on an iphone you kind of stop thinking about the hardware and that doesn't mean that this is the best spec phone on the planet it's not this doesn't have the biggest battery this doesn't have the highest resolution display it definitely doesn't have the most ram but the software is so optimized that it runs well regardless even actually on last year's iphone i couldn't find a single app on the app store that didn't work or wasn't compatible i didn't find a single game that my phone wouldn't play at the highest possible frame rate and that kind of polish that also carried through to what i produced with those apps like the quality of my voice notes from whatsapp that jumped from here to here moving from samsung to iphone the video call quality that the other person sees that improved too and probably the best example of this is snapchat and instagram stories without fail since jumping every time i've posted an instagram story somebody has asked me what phone has that taken on because it looked so good i very rarely had that before except a couple of times when i was using one of those old huawei phones and i'm doing a really good job of controlling the bright areas people were genuinely concerned about my microphone quality i've only had one weird bug with whatsapp just every now and again while i was typing it would randomly force close which was pretty annoying but i've reinstalled it and it seems to be okay now touchwood and if you're enjoying this video the sub to the channel would be tasty what about customization though because you remember that when i first set this iphone up the lack of customization is one of those things that immediately hit me well it's not great but it hasn't bothered me as much as i thought it would have like if i think back to when i was on android i would rarely fiddle with the really advanced settings things like changing the grid size of the home screen or making my own widgets so i'm not too bothered by those things not being here i've kind of developed a sort of muscle memory for where every app is on my home screen i'm okay with it but what i would change is how apple handles icons because on android icon packs are one of the quickest ways to completely change the feel of your phone without messing up where everything is on iphone you have to create a shortcut for each and every app you have to download every icon individually and then apply the new icons to the new shortcuts one by one i did find a couple of other methods but they've all got their own caveats and it just feels like the iphone is sitting in a pointless middle ground like if apple is going to let users change the way their icons look anyways they might as well make that process easy and fun like what if apple made a first party app with all apple approved themes on it and you could just hit one button and it would apply instantly that would be amazing also what is up with the way that apple handles wallpapers how is it that the wage change wallpaper is still to find settings to scroll down to hit wallpaper to hit choose new wallpaper to pick a category pick a wallpaper click set and then click set both it's more complicated than my relationship status and while you do technically get some inbuilt dynamic moving wallpapers as far as i can see unless you jailbreak your phone there's no way of getting any more the only live wallpapers that you can download are actually just static wallpapers that can move but only if you hold down whilst being on your lock screen but i just don't understand in what situation anyone would ever do that so it's not perfect but it is better than it used to be ios 14 means you can now add a bit of personality to your home screen and the fact that they allow widgets from third-party apps is a solid step forward plus it's kind of novel to me that every iphone user gets the same update on the same day it's not like when you're on a samsung where you see oh android 11 has some awesome features i can't wait to try it like next year or something when i actually get the update no it almost felt like a community day on twitter when everyone got ios 14 at the same time and it felt like the whole world was showcasing all the new setups they'd made using it also just on the note of customization i've also realized that while yes the internal customization you can do on the iphone is much worse than android the external customization you can do is greater you know i have that smartphone gadget series right where i showcase all those weird but wonderful accessories well of the 150 or so gadgets i've shown in that series probably only five of them don't support iphones whether it's cases whether it's camera lenses or gaming controllers i think most companies build for iphone first and it makes sense even though samsung usually sells more phones overall apple sells far more phones on average per model and so if your company can only build let's say a case design for 10 different phones you're gonna make sure that the iphones are part of that plus you've also just got the fact that iphone users have a higher propensity to spend on accessories so no this is not my dream experience but at the same time for each one of those issues that i had to start with with ios and iphones the somewhat uninteresting cameras the lacking hardware the poor customization they've not disappeared but they have become less of a problem one more thing though apple is definitely a company who operates on a if it ain't broke don't fix it philosophy and so i would say of all brands of phones with apple you probably have the least actual change between generations like if you look at samsung's phones last year versus this year huge change if you look at xiaomi's phones huge change again but it's not really the case here when apple makes changes it's usually because they're planning on keeping them they have a formula that works and they want to make careful incremental improvements to it whereas when a lot of android phone makers add features they've got no intention of keeping them it's more a case of we've got this new phone how do we make something cool for this model that people are going to talk about so you'll quite often have samsung or huawei or xiaomi announced something amazing let's say that their next phone is going to have a hundred times camera zoom and then on the following model after that they decide well most people actually didn't need that let's just make it 50 times now and so for apple i think this slower strategic build it's both a bad thing and a good thing i've been using an iphone now long enough to experience what it's like upgrading from one to the next and it was one of those cases where i was so excited i ripped open the packaging i transferred all my stuff but then there was a little moment of okay everything's transferred and everything looks the same i guess i'll just carry on doing what i was doing everything from the software to the hardware feels so similar that it is possible to sometimes forget you've actually swapped phones i had less of that initial oh i can't wait to try the new 100x zoom camera more of a okay this is going to be great from now on my photos will be brighter and my downloads will be faster it's less drastic but more deliberate evolution okay so to conclusively answer the question do i regret switching to iphone huh no there are things i miss but for the purposes of what i want from my phone it was a good decision besides the fact that i already used a mac for work has brought up some interesting opportunities like you might know this already but if you use an iphone and a macbook your macbook can take calls which might sound a lot like one of those features that's really cool to have but you'll never use but i use it every day i'm someone who's very productivity focused so when i'm working at my computer i purposefully tried to stay away from my phone but when i used to do this on my old android some part of me was a little bit uncomfortable like what if there's a delivery driver who's trying to call me what if there's an emergency what if there's some sort of work meeting that i completely forgot to schedule i don't have to worry about it now i can do my work i can keep instagram and twitter away and i can be rest assured that if someone needs to reach me they still can airdrop is good enough that even though i transfer a lot of photos between phone and computer i haven't had to plug my phone in once to do that transfer when you're trying to find a wi-fi to connect to on the go you can always just connect straight to your iphone's internet from your laptop it's a great feature and i don't use this one much but if you're browsing the internet on your phone it's pretty slick that with one tap on your computer you can carry on exactly where you were so the takeaway of all of this is that if you're on an android right now and you look at iphones and think well that sucks that sucks it's missing this you're probably in the right place there's a lot to like about android but if you're in the position that i was in where you're kind of on the fence you're using an android phone but you're looking at ios like damn that integration looks amazing then i don't think it's a decision you'd regret it's worth at least trying it okay you've probably heard me talk about surfsharkvpn for a while now and there's a reason for that see there's a lot of companies who want to work with tech youtube channels i've had other vpns i've had shaving companies i've had makeup brands but you probably noticed this i say no to almost all of them but surf shark is something that i genuinely think is just good value while a lot of epns charge like 30 a person per month this costs just over two dollars a month for everyone and you're still getting the same anonymous secure internet browsing and that ability to access sites that are usually restricted to other parts of the world like the us version of netflix also i mostly use this on my mac so it's cool that with one tap on the bar at the top i can quick connect to the last server i was connected to when people ask me which vpn i recommend even in person i tell them it's this one so check the link in description and there is a code boss which will give you 83 off and an extra three months for free thanks a lot for watching my name is aaron this is mr who's the boss and i'll catch you in the next one jesse jesse wake up i need your phone you've got a samsung right i gotta use your phone right now jesse for scientific purposes where's your samsung phone jesse i need virtual assistants immediately where is his where no no no no no no no no no Agastya! Do you remember
what day is today? So far from Earth.
What difference does that make? Whether it Monday or Friday
every day is the same to us. No stupid!
Remember, exactly an year ago, we left on this
mission on 25th August. 25th August! Oh my God! What happened? I forgot to call my friend, Suhan. Today is his birthday. Suhan? Yeah! He is an old friend of mine. From Houston? No. From Mumbai, India. From India?

phone is ringing near the control. Can you please switch it off? Oh sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Vikas. Secretary. Yes, tell me Vikas.
- Sir, We've mind-blowing roal? Bajirao's? No. He's his friend Tukarav's. Do will I carry Bajirao's
palanquin in the whole film? I've told you so many times,
no side roles. I do only main leads. Sorry guys. I was saying my little uncle and.. Excuse me. This is embarrassing. Uncle. Uncle I was
just talking about you. Uncle will you call
me in two minutes? I'm giving a speech on the stage. I've called many times,
are you still dreaming? Uncle. Dream? Yes, uncle. Come to my office immediately. Come, I've an urgent
matter to talk with you. Uncle, I'll just come. Suhan! My hero! My superstar! Uncle.. ..basket. Uncle, what is the trouble? That you woke me
up early in the morning. You are right. Give it to me. Sorry! Sorry!
- What were you trying to do? Sorry, uncle. I was trying
to help you. I won't do it. You want to help
me because I am a dwarf. No, uncle! Tell me from
where do you look like a dwarf? Exactly. You are my real friend. Are you the new assistant? Yes, sir. Pandey. Mr. Pandey, henceforth
knock before entering my office. Sorry, Bonny sir. What did you say?
- Bonny sir. It's not Bonny sir. It's Bonney! I don't know why my

- Of course! Of course! Why do you need a leave? Sir, my car has broken down.
Its bonnet has broken. Bonnet? Get out! Get out! No need to hide
your laughter, dear. Very soon these
tears of happiness.. ..are going to be converted
into tears of sorrow. No! A notice had come
today in the morning. Of Piya's lawyer. Ayear ago Mr. Suhan Kapoor and Ms.
Piya Goyal had divorced. The court had declared
that every month on the 1st.. ..the husband Suhan Kapoor
will send a cheque of 25,000.. ..as alimony to
his wife Piya Goyal. But even after
a year Suhan Kapoor.. ..has not sent even a single
cheque of alimony to Piya Goyal. Because of Suhan Kapoor's
carelessness Piya Goyal.. ..had to undergo tremendous
financial, physical and mental stress. Because it has been
proved that Piya Goyal.. ..can't depend on Suhan
Kapoor every month.. ..so Piya Goyal demands
a one time settlement.. ..of 50 lakhs as an
alimony from Suhan Kapoor. 50 lakhs! You have one month's time
to repay the settlement amount. Suhan! Suhan! Suhan! Catch the ball! Uncle! I had heard that poison
is used to treat poison. But shock is used to treat shock.. ..I am seeing it for the first time. 50 lakhs! Uncle,
from where will I get 50 lakhs? I don't have enough
money to even pay.. ..the telephone
and electricity bill. I have not paid my house
rent for the past 3 months. This has no connection
with the law. Law had decided the amount. And you have not paid
a single penny to Piya. But uncle, Piya doesn't need money. I don't have work. She
should be giving me the alimony. But when you got divorced,
at that time you had work.. ..and Piya had no work. Correct! Correct! But now the tables have turned. She has work. That too in New York. She is earning in dollars.
Uncle, I have no work. So we have to go to the
court and re-evaluate this case. And you will have to
get me the alimony. Correct. Really? How much? I think 50,000 per month is fine. 50,000! I will strangulate you! Why? You didn't like my idea? Not at all! At least some
time take your work seriously. This is a court case. You have not given a single penny.. ..to Piya in the past
one-year as alimony. If you will go to the court,
then you yourself will get stuck. Uncle, what should I do? I don't get any work. Whatever money I had,
I spent that.. ..on bodybuilding
and photo session. Where will I get 50 lakhs? Dear, you will have
to arrange for the money. Otherwise you will
have to rot in the prison. I will not go to the prison. If I went to prison..
then my dream of becoming.. ..a super star will
be completely shattered. I will somehow survive.
But you won't. You've to think.
- Me? I will think of a brilliant idea. I could have never imagined! I could have never imagined
that Piya would behave like this! I don't know what
have I done that.. ..she is taking revenge from me! She wants to send me to prison. What is this?
- I am showing you the flashback. So that you will get
a rough idea about my life. People who live for
love they are lucky. People who die for
love they too are strange. My saga is precious. Beloved. We are away and still we are near. "I know.." "Love is naive." "Heart tends to make mistakes." "Love is oblivious of patience." "I know that love is naive." "Heart tends to make mistakes." "Love is oblivious of patience." "I know that love is naive." "Heart tends to make mistakes." 'Love is oblivious of patience." "Beloved." "Beloved." "Beloved." If you had not given
me the stupid idea.. ..of eloping with Piya that night.. ..then today my plight
wouldn't have been this. I couldn't see your plight. What did I know that Piya
would turn out to be like this? She looked so innocent. "What happened that
is the norm of the society." "Mom didn't agree." "Dad was angry." "That was the sign
of my downfall." "This was the
only style of love." "They became angry." "And we became rebels." "We were fervent and we escaped." "I know that love is naive." "Heart..
- Tends to make mistakes." "Love is oblivious of patience." 'Hey." "Hey." "Hey." "Hey." "Hey." "Hey." "Hey." "Hey." My hero? No, no. Sir. Sir, did you call me? The assistant said
that you are married. Yes, sir. The girl who
had come in the office with me. Sir, she is my wife. Piya. Your wife? If the public comes to know
that my hero is a married man.. ..then who will come
to watch my movie? I'll lose millions. If I knew you were married,
I wouldn't have signed you. You've to hide the
fact that you're married. You've to stay away from your
wife till the film is released. Okay, sir. Are we going somewhere? "I am worried about
one helplessness." "You will be sad to know it.
But I am with you." "I will have to
stay away from you." "It's a matter of only a couple
of months. Please endure it." "My future, I swear on you." "My future is with Piya." "I know that love is naive." "Heart tends to make mistakes." "Love is oblivious of patience." I'm ruined. It was my mistake to invest
money on you. Super flop hero! "When I returned back defeated." "Back to my home." "Piya had already left." "She didn't even answer my call." "I wrote her letters
throughout the year. 'But my voice didn't
reach to her." "My Piya got lost somewhere." "I was hopeful that some
day she will also call me." "I know that love is naive." "Heart tends to make mistakes." "Love is oblivious of patience." It fell down. Your story is very sad.
It is very emotional. Even today I don't understand.. ..why she did this to me. She ditched me at the
time when I needed her the most. Women are like this. You can never trust women. If you have wealth and fame,
then women will hover around you. And when you are in trouble,
they will leave you in a lurch. I understand all these things. There is only one thing
that I don't understand. From where will I get 50 lakhs? Friend, you don't worry about that. You don't worry about that. Because the one
who has given hunger.. ..He will provide
you with food too. Because the one
who has given thirst.. ..He will provide
you with alcohol too. And the one who has given alcohol,
he will give snacks too. The one who has given the trouble,
he will solve it too. We will surely find a scapegoat.. ..from whom we will get 50 lakhs. What scapegoat, uncle?
- What scapegoat? A scapegoat that has 50 lakhs. A foolish man who is
willing to give us 50 lakhs. A fool who will dance to our tunes. A fool who will listen
to everything that we say. An idiot who will
do whatever we say. But from where will we find
such a foolish and idiot person? Excuse me.. the back one. Listen to me. Sell this house. This house doesn't
belong to my father. I am a tenant. And for the last
3 months, I have not paid the rent. How much will you
get for your old car? I already sold it 3
months back for 50 lakhs. You can't sell your house and car. Do you have something to sell? Uncle.
- Yes. How much will I get for my kidney? Don't talk rubbish. The one who has nobody,
God is with him. I don't say this.
It is written in the books. Now only God can save us. Let's ask God's help. Help. Help. We don't have any other option. First time I'm
asking you something. No other way too. Send an Angel who will
solve all our problems. Please! Please! Let's see who has come. Hi Guys. Hi. Like this I entered
Suhan's life as an angel. What are you looking for?
- What are you looking for? Piya.
- Piya? Piya does not stay here. But the address says she is here. Hold it. - Please help the child.
- I am not a child. Excuse me.
- I am sorry uncle. She does not stay here.
She has been divorced. Divorce. Piya cannot go away like this. How can Piya be
compared to that guy? Piya is an angel and
that man is a bloody animal. It's all my mistake,
I shouldn't have let her go. I should have been with her. God, don't know in what
condition she could be? What?
- Your introduction? Is this a time for introduction? Let us ask in English. How are you bloody? Who are you? Oh, I am sorry. Actually sorry, I have stayed
in the US for the past seven years. And so my Hindi is not that..
- It's Ok. Anyways, I am Agastya
Rao from NASA Houston Texas.. ..United States of America. And your Zip code?
- Pin code? F5176721 Let's be serious guys. Yes, serious, serious. I am sorry,
after hearing the news.. ..of Piya's divorce
I became a bit Hyper. I am sorry.
- I can understand. Its Ok, can you help me?
Tell me know where she stays. Aunty contact number,
address, E-mail ID.. Anything. She's gone. She's gone. Where has she gone?
- New York! - New York! New York? After seven years I collected
my wits and came to meet Piya.. ..and she is in New York? And I have a surprise for her. Should have called at
least before coming here. This guy looks like an fraud to me. Yeah. Sure. How do you know Piya? You are? You are?
- My name is Suhan Kapoor. Super Star! This means you are the new
owners of this house. - Oh yes. But the way you are
asking questions to me.. ..as if you know Piya very well. As if you are her relatives,
could be a brother From your talks it looks like
you know Piya's family very well. Yes.
- Is it? - How? No, I don't know Piya's family,
but I know Piya very well. She was my girl friend.
- What? Yes, she was my sweet heart? But, Piya's marriage was
going to be with someone else.. What did I tell you? She was surely my girl friend.. ..but I was not
her boy friend. - Oh! Actually,
Piya was surely going to marry me. But then she married that bull. Have you seen him? He looked like King Kong. I had already said that Piya
can't be happy with that Gorilla. She was a delicate doll,
and the guy was a hairy bear! But you did not tell,
how did you know her? How did I know? Actually we studied together. She was the love of my life.. ..my sweet heart. This is me and Piya. That is the only one copy with me. Keep it carefully. That was the last time I saw Piya. She was very happy. But now.. I don't know how she would be now. No son, don't say like that. You were saying how
Piya was going to marry you. Yes. It is a long story.
It will take lots of time. You don't worry about time.
We have enough. What do you say?
- Yes. I still remember vividly.. My first day in college. E = mc2. I don't know
how that genius cracked it. Amazing. Einstein, genius.
What's the time? Ok, ok. I am going. Bye, bye. Ouch! Hey! Sorry.. Love at first sight. I remember.
The first day of the college. The first day of the college.
My foot! What happened, then? Days passed away,
we started coming closer.. Me and Piya were like one. Whatever class,
chemistry, physics.. ..we sat together. Then, one day.. Sure, sure. Sure. Excuse me. Excuse me. Who are you? What do you want? Me, Agastya Roy. Your neighbor.
Always stay next to you. Really? I never saw you before? But I have seen you always.
- What? Your sister. She's calling you.
She's waiting outside. Come here.
Please pass my message.. - No. No. Sir. I have one question, sir.
- Yes? Very good question, Agastya. Yeah, come in. You dropped your book. Agastya! What are you doing? It was the first time I remember. I mean.. I had sacrificed for Piya. I'm performing in your
college tomorrow night. Who will you come with? Somebody has to accompany me. You know I've psychological problem.. I can't see you with any other man. Suhan, please, buddy. Your concert,
and how can I go alone? Don't get jealousy.
Okay listen to me. I'll come with the man you suggest. Come with him. You've already
floored too many here. I don't expect trouble
from this idiot. No problem. Ok. Ok Even today when
I think of that day.. ..my ears start ringing. My sacrifice didn't got wasted. I was sitting alone
on the steps and thinking.. Hi Champu. Oh my god! Are you crying? No. There was something in my eye. Take this. - What's this? I am sorry, it was because of me. No. Not because of you. Don't be sorry. You are a friend.
And in friendship, you never say: : ..sorry or thank you. Friends are friends. Ok? Oh Champu, you are so sweet. Don't cry. Ok, listen. Will you come to the rock-show
along with me as my date? I would love to.
I would love to come. Champu, you are late. Sorry, I had gone
to buy a new suit. How do I look?
- Wow! At least look at it once. Come on. Come on. Get rocking. Super star! "Say A O
- A O." "A O.
- A. O." I can't hear you. "Louder!" "Colour it, fly away, fly away." "Spread the net, fly away." "Colour it, fly away, fly away." "Spread the net, fly away." "This love..
of mine, is not new." "Then why am I flying?" "Because, colours in the
eyes it also brought me along." "If you find a man of your choice,
fly away." "Colour it, fly away, fly away." "Spread the net, fly away." "I could take the
lines of some ones palm." "If some one wishes,
I would treat him." "Listen to what your heart says." "And then fly away." 'This love.. of mine, is not new." "Then why am I flying?" "Fire. When it burns,
does not extinguish." "On this heart,
it comes and settles." "Love,
if you find, then fly away." "Fly away." "Colour it, fly away, fly away." "Spread the net, fly away." "Colour it, fly away, fly away." "Spread the net, fly away." "Puts your hands together!" "Do you want more?" After listening
to such a sad story.. ..my eyes water,
and my throat is dry. I will go and get tea. Shall I get some
thing for you, Champu? I am sorry. I entered your character. Shall I get something for you,
Agastya? Yeah, I will just have a..
Bourn vita. Its not Bourn and then Vita.
It's Bournvita. Ok? Come. Follow me. What are you looking for?
Recipe for vita? - Shut up! Found it! What did you find uncle,
5 millions? I did not find 5 million rupees,
but an idea to obtain it. She'll give money.
- Now listen carefully. Section 25,
Under Hindu Marriage Act. After divorce,
a husband has to take care.. ..of his wife's expenses,
unless she is married again. Once your Ex-wife remarries.. ..then her responsibility
passes to the second husband. And you.. need not give
money towards expenses. This means if Piya
gets married to Champu.. ..then we will
get 5 million rupees? Ok. This time nothing
should go wrong. As you wish. I am doing it for you,
as being your friend and lawyer. I was doing my duty. Now it is your wish. There is no loss, uncle?
- No. So.. what do you say As you wish. I was thinking, we wont
find a better suitor for our Piya. So we should find
a auspicious time.. ..and get both of them married. Even I was thinking the same. Take son. Bournvita for you.
- Thank you. So son, what have you thought?
What will you do in life? Nothing uncle.
I'm thinking of going back home. But you know, I'm worried
about Piya. I don't know what
condition she might be in. Look son, whatever happens
in life is for good. Had everything been
alright in Piya's life.. ..then today you would be
having Bournvita with her husband. You wouldn't be having Bournvita
standing here with him and me. You wouldn't be having Bournvita. What?
- He hasn't got it. I'll expalin you. Son, you are having
Bournvita with us here.. ..because Piya has been
separated from her husband. He still hasn't got it. One second uncle. Are you telling me
about Piya or Bournvita? Hey shut up, shut up. You haven't got it,
I'll explain to you. You.. I'll tell you.
Piya has been divorced. Has been divorced.
- Yeah. That means she doesn't
stay with her husband. That means she is alone once again. You have come here after 7 years,
crossing the seven seas, why? To have Bournvita.
- Shut up? You haven't come for Bournvita! You have come because you
are destined to be with Piya.. ..and Piya is destined
to be with you. You are made for each other. Made for each other.
- Yeah. Really?
- Yes. Yes. She is only yours, only yours.
- Only yours. She's mine?
- Yeah, she's yours. Your name is written on her. Otherwise why would
she have divorced? Why? - Why would you come
here after 7 years? - Why? Yeah man, that makes sense.
- Of course, that makes sense. Then why are you here
having Bournvita with us? Why? Here is her address, that she had
sent for forwarding her letters etc. Take a flight to New York and after
22 hours, Piya will be in your arms. One second. But.. What will I do there? Do we have to explain to you? Yes you will.
- Will I? Shut up. I'll tell you.
This is magic. See. "It knows, it doesn't believe,
it believes, it doesn't know. The world.." Please come in.. Greeting. Greeting. Please come and sit here. What are you doing here? Who will play the music?
Your father? "It knows, it doesn't believe,
it believes, it doesn't know.." "The whole world knows,
only Piya doesn't know.." "It knows, it doesn't believe,
it believes, it doesn't know.." "The whole world knows,
only Piya doesn't know.." "The heart knows the beloved.." 'The heart knows the beloved.." "But Piya doesn't
know the heart.." "It knows, it doesn't believe,
it believes, it doesn't know.." "The whole world knows,
only Piya doesn't know.." "In broken poetry.." "I have written in the diary.." "You are the last rain.." "You are the last request.." "In broken poetry.." "I have written in the diary.." "You are the last rain.." "You are the last request.." "Why don't you understand.." "The heart is a deep well.." "Afire burns every time.." "There is smoke everywhere.." "Jump, you will get Piya.." "Move a little,
the world will move too.." "Die and fall in love.." What are you doing uncle,
the song is so good. You fool. If you play just one
song, the audience will get bored. "The whole world knows,
only Piya doesn't know.." "Show some charm of yours.." "If you love Piya.." "Let life be lost, if it does.." "It is a small risk.." "Show some charm of yours.." "If you love Piya.." "Let life be lost, if it does.." "It is a small risk.." "If you cut it with your nail.." "Even the diamond will be cut.." "If you even look at it.." "The bulb will explode.." "The system of
love is the same.." "You need the same strength.." If she is not there.. "The heart knows the beloved.." "The heart knows the beloved.." 'But Piya doesn't
know the heart.." "It knows, it doesn't believe,
it believes, it doesn't know.." "The whole world knows,
only Piya doesn't know.." "It knows, it doesn't believe,
it believes, it doesn't know.." "The whole world knows,
only Piya doesn't know.." Hey guys, thank you very much. You have opened my eyes, you know? You have made me feel that even.. ..this could happen
between Piya and me. Leave it man,
do you think it is yours? Excuse me. They have taken
my make-believe Piya. But I'm going to New York,
for the real one. Congrats.
- Thank you. Thank you very much. Okay. Hey guys. Thank you. Really thank you very much. What is the need for that? This is our duty.
- We are friends. - Friends. Uncle. Bon.. Bon?
- Bon? Voyage! You bloody Bon Voyage! Now there will be fun! No chance. No chance. Uncle. Do you think, this Champu
will be able to impress Piya. This Champu? Have you gone mad?
You will have to do this. No problem. But uncle.
How will I go to New York? This is my lifelong saving. I had saved it for my wedding. Now it will be
used for your divorce. Take it son. Take it son.
- I have taken it uncle. I promise, ..that after my divorce
I will get you married. He was on flight.. I was down in a taxi. Proceeding to New
York in search of Piya. What will I do there? I didn't have any idea. Who else knows it better than me. Here's your boarding
pass and your passport. Thank you. Hi. Window or aisle? Anything will do, but Agastya Rao
should be nearby. Hey Sohan. Agastya. Agastya Rao. Champu. "Piya knows the heart.." Yeah man. After all you have taken my advice. You are going to New York? Yeah. And what about you?
Where are you off to? I am going to Ghatkopar. Ghatkopar? Where is that
I'll get down at the next stop. Hey stop man. Sure. Excuse me. Can I have one
hot chocolate please? I need to relax before take off. Sorry sir,
there's no service before take off. You will have to wait.
- Okay. Where's my belt? Here it is. May I have an apple juice. There's no service
before take off sir. But I'll see what I can do. Oh and hot chocolate
for this young man here. Sure.
- Thank you. He needs to relax before take off. Wow! How can you do it? How can you do all these things? Did you see that girl? Had I been like you,
I would have been with Piya. I don't even know.. ..how to talk to girls. Wish I was like you man. Me? In charming girls? Yeah. It's my luck, I was born with it. There's nothing one can't do. Cool. Cool. Hot chocolate sir.
- Thank you. And your apple juice. Thank you sweetheart. And you know what? This is for you. Thanks. I'm getting nervous
thinking that when I.. ..meet Piya tomorrow,
what will become of me? I don't even know what
she likes or dislikes. I hope I don't make
a fool out of myself. God has sent me
to solve your problem. If this is not a
miracle then what is it? In the same flight,
we are both going to New York. And that too,
not alone, but sitting together. Yeah. I promise you. I'll help you out. Specially after hearing
your about your pining for her. Really? I have promised uncle that,
until I.. ..get you married.. ..I won't catch
a flight back to Mumbai. Promise. Our mission started like this. And then begun the
biggest con in the history. I completely surrendered
myself to Suhan. He was my Godfather. Excuse me sir.. ..can you guide me to this address? The sweet little girl next door. Piya.
- Yes. My neighbor. You've come to the
right address young man. She's right up there
in her apartment. But why is the window closed. She's probably sleeping right now. You must be the brother
she's been talking about. Her brother? Probably. Nice meeting you. Hey guys. "My love for you is not new" "But still why?" What is this. "I will make a house
in front of your house.." "I will make my world.." "In my neighboring window,
there's a piece of moon.." "It is regrettable that it is.." What are you looking at? You have forgotten
the mission so soon. Oh yes. Piya. Show me. She is probably sleeping.
- Okay. You keep watching.
Call me quickly when she wakes up. What happened? What happened? You were right. She has grown so much in 7 years. Behave yourself.
- Sorry. Relax.
- Sorry. - Chill. - Sorry. Have you gone crazy? She looks like Piya to you? Then who is she? Please. Get the number of your
specs checked Mr. Agastya Rao, okay? I am an Indian, not Russian.
- What? Agastya, Agastya. What? Agastya Rao. Sorry. Can I see once, once? Please. Agastya! What is this? What is this? I am an astronaut
and this is a telescope. Father of binoculars. Move. Let me see. Why are you pushing me? Hold this. Amazing Something will have
to be done. Suhan understood
I can't impress Piya. So he changed my
personality just like him. I am looking just like you, right? Rock Star. Yeah! Sir, what can I get for you? An apple juice and wine. Uncle!
- Uncle? Who uncle and whose uncle. Do you have a twin brother
in India? This small. If I am this big then
how can my twin be this much? I don't have a twin brother. I'll ask my parents.. Saw that. Absolutely identical.
He is uncle's carbon copy. How is it possible?
- Why it can't be possible? It is written that there
are at least seven people in this.. ..with similar face. It is all nonsense. No it is not nonsense. It
is a scientifically proven thing. There are seven people
who look similar in this world. And.. And? Just a minute. That means that there
must be seven more.. ..girls looking just like Piya. I think I should be after them at
least I will get one of them. What say? Do you love Piya's
face or her personality? Both. Then you forget all this
nonsense and concentrate.. ..on the mission. Ok. Tell me. Today is the mission's first
day so we will do warm up today. Listen, you do exactly
what I tell you to do. Not a penny less
or not a penny more. Otherwise the whole
mission will get ruined. When Piya comes
out of her apartment.. ..when you look at.. ..her you react as if
you have seen her suddenly. Just show me once more. Now I'll do it.
Just look at me. - Ok. You do wonderful false acting.
You should have been in Hollywood. Now stop it. Now listen further When she is walking ahead you'll.. ..call her by her name.
Like this.. Piya! Piya!
- Oh! My God! You here?
- How amazing! - How amazing! She will turn back and look at you. Go my lion.
My blessings are with you. You remember everything,
right? - No. What? - I forget everything
when I look at Piya. You please come with me. Why? Why? Why.. Why? No, why.. why am
I asking this question? Why? - Ok. Come on, let us go back home.
Please. - No. I'll do one thing. I will go with you, I will be near
you but I will not be with you. Ok? Ok. - Wait.
You'll go like this to her. Thank you, brother. Let's rock it now. Rock it. Rock it in and out.. Ok. Let's go. Understood Champu,
what you've to do? Hello! Yes, everything is fine. Oh! Piya! What are you doing?
Go back. Energy.. loud.. feeling.. emotion.. Take 2. Ready? Action! Hello! No,
no, there is absolutely.. Oh! Piya? Cut! Cut! Cut! What are you doing? Go back. Call out louder, Piya. Take 3. Action! Yes, everything I fine.. Piya! Me.. Me.. Oh! My God! Champu?! You have changed so much, Champu? When did you come to New York? This morning.. Today morning. Nothing. Nice meeting you. Hi! Piya!
- Hi! Zubin. Zubin Batlibhoy. Hi! Bye! Bye! Piya! Piya Bye! Bye! Where are you Piya? Bye! Did you see that how
Piya just went with Zubin? I saw. I saw everything. Don't worry.. ..she'll not for him. But what happened to you? Had you applied henna on your lips? I had told you earlier that
the moment I see Piya something.. ..happens to me. I think I have laid
a bet on a lame horse. I have a bright idea. Sorry, I was hearing you both.
I could not stop myself. This is.. ..a micro walkie-talkie. With this I sit here
and control my entire staff. You are too much, uncle. When you want to stop
showing off then tell us. We want to take
something important. I was just trying to help you. Please, don't pay attention to him.
You tell me what you wanted to say. Oh! You are a good boy. You know you put this
one behind your ear and the.. ..other one you put
it behind your ear. And then what ever you
want him to do you tell him. You will keep telling him
and he will keep doing them. Wow! Uncle.
At least you were of some use. Come on,
now your work will be done. Thank you, very much. But listen, remember
its range is only 100 meters. Come on Punk, let's rock. Just say it once more. Once more. Come on Punk, let's rock. You are bloody clear man. Shut up. Come on, punk let's rock. Come on, give me your credit card. Why? Why? Why am I asking this question?
I am just thinking this. After all you are going
for my work, brother. - Right. You are going for my work. Not this one.. give me this one. After today this credit
card will remain with me and.. ..you will keep sitting in the car. It is Ok.
He has taken my credit card. Who the hell are you? You did not recognise me?
- No. That means that nobody
will be able to recognise me. And I will be at a distance
of 100 meters from you. This is a book on Picasso.
- But this is an old book. Second hand, only then it
will appear like you've read it. Excuse me, Can I help you? Oh! Champu, it's you? I am sorry I.. No. From your mouth
even Champu sounds sexy. But how come you are here? I was passing by and I saw
that it was an Interiors shop.. You work here. No. This is my store. I do Interior designing.
- You own this store? Yes. These are your designs
- Yes. You know these flowers. Halcyon? Wonderful! Fabulous! Do you like flowers? Oh! What? Do you like flowers? I love flowers.
- I love flowers. Flowers are in my blood.
- Flowers are in my blood. When you see me.. You feel I don't
go well with flowers. Never judge anyone with appearance. You are the flower Halycon. It's found in tropical
forest of South America. Very good. Shake hands now. I am impressed. In spite of being a man
you are so interested in flowers. Listen I do not believe
in this boy-girl thing. I do not believe in boy-girl thing. I am a homosexual. I am a homosexual. Oh Shit! Don't say that. You say, I am a heterosexual. Heterosexual. Oops! Oops! You like Picasso? I like Picasso? I love Picasso.
Picasso is in my blood. But how did you know? Oh! Sharp observation. I have read Picasso four times. You know what is the
best thing about Picasso? What? So, you were telling
me something about Picasso. Oh! Yes, Picasso. Picasso.. Who are you?
- Zorro. Zorro? Then become
invisible and show me. You really want
to know about Picasso? You are a fraud. Fraud! You do this and show me. How could you that Zubin? No, I didn't do anything. Zorro, it was him
outside your boutique. You guys can't believe it. I am too glad that
you've come to our Casino. I had done all the
arrangements for the Fresh food. But suddenly how come
you are in a mood of having.. ..Italian food. You like Italian? I like Italian? I love Italian. Italian is in my blood. Suhan never got an opportunity
to wear different get ups. So he used this opportunity
to wear different costumes. Always came in a different costume.
And he was funny. I'll have one Vinaigrette. I'll have the same. Thanks. And I'll have a diet coke. Just diet coke. Come on, Zubin. Order something. No. I hate Italian food. Specially spicy food. You don't like spicy food? You don't like spicy food?
- No. You like spicy food. I like spicy food. I love spicy food. Spice is in my blood.
- Spice is in my blood. Aditya, you are alright? I am Ok. I love spicy food. Eat more of that.. what
was that Italiano.. - Vinaigrette You? You were at
the boutique too, right? Now I know. You are following us. Come on, let us go. What are you looking for Aditya? What was I looking for? Brooklyn Tower! I wanted to see
it since my childhood. It's very beautiful, isn't it? Thanks for everything. You should not thank me.
You should thank Zubin. He paid the bill. No, I did not mean that. I really had a great
time this evening. Me too. In fact.. ..after 7 years
I have laughed so much. 7 years? Can I ask you something? Hope you will not feel bad. Did you love a girl in the college? I heard that she broke your
heart so you left college and.. ..went away. We did not come to
know where you had gone. You just disappeared. You used to love that
girl very much, right? Do you love her now also? I am sorry.. . I think you are
unable to forget her. You don't mind me asking.. Who she was. Look if only you want it. I might be of some help to you. Please tell me who was she. You. How can you help me? Ok. Now she is already married. Then you can get any good girl. You forget her.
- No. I will marry her only. No. If I get married then
I will marry her only.. ..otherwise.. If Suhan hadn't come, the show
would've ended before the start. In thirty seconds she will
come out wearing a nightie. Oh! But where have I kept the remote? Oh! Yes, in the kitchen. She will jump on the couch. Now she will watch.. ..emotional films and
cry like Meena Kumari. What are you doing? I am eating chocolate
and studying the case. That's enough. Excuse me. What is it? Are you a wrestler? What will you do by watching? I don't think you should
watch like this. - Why? Then you too will fall in love. What? What? I don't need anybody's love. I am happy alone.
You keep your Piya to yourself. Now what have you done? Satellite connection? No. Telescope.
- Oh! Fantastic. Yeah. Pop corn?
- Yeah. "It is an unknown city." "It is an unknown evening." "Life is.. ..unknown." "What is your name?" "Strange is this life." "This life is strange." "Here you meet then separate." "After separation again we meet." "It is an unknown city." 'Without you also.." .."I feel sadness is sweet." 'What? Is this your magic?" "You are not aware
that the earth.." "..under your feet is saying." "What? Is this your thought?" 'Lt is an unknown.." "..city." "I found life." "Strange is this life." "This life is strange." "I had thought it is near." "But it is somebody else's fate." "It is the incident
of one night." "You were lying on the clouds." "I remember.." .."you had called me." "You were feeling cold." "You had draped thin
moonlight on yourself." "And you were sleeping
in the shawl of dreams." "Let it be strange ..but you are merged
in my breaths." "Strange is this life." "This life is strange." "This life is not for me." "It is the fate
of somebody else." First time I saw a faint
hope of love in Piya's eyes for me. And it was interval
for our mission. You look stunning. How do I look? Like a rock star. Man, super star. No, super star. What happened? No. Nothing. I just remembered something. Good or bad? Good or bad? Good. Hi, can I have a glass
of Red wine please? What will you have? Apple juice.. and wine. And wine.. Now drink the cocktail of it. Why are you looking
at me like this? I am looking at your 6th smile. I am looking at your 6th smile. What! - Do you know
you have 6 kinds of smiles? Do you know you have
6 kinds of smiles? Smile number one,
when you smile whole-heartedly. Smile number one,
when you smile whole-heartedly. Smile number two,
when you smile very late. Smile number three,
when you smile coyly. Smile number four,
when you smile mischievously. Smile number five when
you smile to greet somebody. And smile number 6.. When you smile to hide something. When you smile to hide something. Smile once please. What are you hiding from me? Agastya, go to Piya. Call him outside. Suhan, these are
6 well built people. And we are only two of us.
Actually there is only one person. Just do what I've told you to do. Can you please come out? Please!
These are very cheap people. Don't lock horns with them. I will be back. Agastya. Suhan was furious. I tried in vain to stop him. If there was any one
who can stop him it was Piya. Oh my God, Agastya! Are you fine? Listen.. ..don't you ever, ever say..
one second. Don't you ever say
anything to her! Okay! I'll send every one to moon. What a knock-out punch
Suhan landed on my face. I was stars in daylight. Piya had great respect for me. From an idiot Champu
I had become a Champion to her. Hi. There is a small party at my home. So I have called to invite you. Party! Yes. A birthday party.
- Birthday party! Okay. Yeah, yeah.
Of course I will come. I will come. This evening? I have a meeting this evening. Oh no! It will be very
good if you can come. Any way no stress.
Work comes first. Yeah off course, work comes first. Work comes first. Okay. Bye-bye. See you. Take care. Why did Suhan did like that? Why did he stop me
from going to Piya's party? I had many such queries in my mind. But I didn't have
the courage to ask him. Excuse me.
- Yes. I have been noticing you
for the last couple of days. Are you an actor by any chance? Yes. Do you want any autograph? Actually no.
- Don't waste my time. Just a second.
I have something to tell you. I am writing a major television
sitcom called Vikram and Juliet. It's a comedy about this.. An Indian Vikram falling
in love with American Juliet. And you want me to play Vikram?
- Well. Not exactly. I am offering the role
of Vikram's driver. Chaukram. What? You don't know whom you
are talking to right now. You don't understand. Chaukram is a major character. I only do main leads. I am a super star. Let me go. What is this? Now what do I do?
The party has got over. Everything is over.
Should I go to wash the vessels? Hi.
- Hi! Agastya, you? Wow! You had some urgent work,
didn't you? Yes. I realised
that no work is more.. ..important than friendship. So I left everything
and I came here. Well, I am so sorry but the party..
- Is over. Everybody had their fill
and they have left. It means your friend
has come at the right time. Do you require my assistance?
- Sure! Come on in! Wow, my brave one!
You have reached to her house. And in short period
enter her heart too. What are you talking? You fool! Brilliant! Brilliant! How beautiful! I mean Can I touch? Come here. Open the window. You fool! Open the window. Such a sweet baby! Looks just like you. Looks just like you. He sits so quietly. She sits very quietly. Her name is Subhangini. She is my little angel.
And today is her birthday. Suhan. Suhan, please.
Now please get up. Suhan. Thank God! There is just 5 minutes.
- I can't come. Suhan, please get up. If she talks something
then to answer her.. Take her out to watch some film.
You needn't talk to her then. Tell me which film
I've to take her? Hi.
- Hello, young man. Great! Great! Hi. My name is Suhan Kapoor.
I am your father. I am your papa. Hi. Handshake? Finger shake. Finger shake. Finger shake. Your mama was right.
You are an angel. Can I carry you in my arms? Yes.
Wow! Come. We'll sit here. Same eyes. Same nose. Same lips. You are my replica. Your smile is just like your papa. Suhan forgot about
time with his daughter. When I and Piya returned. How can you be so careless?
I don't believe this. Oh my sweetheart! I am so sorry! Come! Come here! I will put the shawl around. Can I ask you something?
- Yes. Ask Actually.. No. What's the matter? Actually.. I.. I.. What happened? Did you marry the guy whom
you used to like in the college? I just wanted to ask that. If you don't want
to answer then it is okay. I understand.
It's okay. Just forget it. Oh My God! Yes. Then.. Then.. All our wishes in life
will not be fulfilled. Congratulations, Piya.
You are pregnant. Thank you, doctor. Are we leaving? "I am worried because
of helplessness." "You will be sad to know.
But I am with you." "I will have to
stay away from you." "Just endure it for a while." "My future, I swear on you." 'My future is with Piya." "I know that love is innocent." "Heart tends to
make some mistakes." "Love is ignorant of patience." You didn't tell him? How could I have told him? That day he was very happy. The greatest dream of his
life was going to be fulfilled. But when I realized that
our marriage was creating.. ..barrier for his dreams.. then I decided. By giving him this news,
I couldn't break his dreams. What did you do? I waited for him. I tried many times to talk
with Suhan in my lonliness. Ma'am, can I speak
with Suhan please? I.. I.. I.. He warned me not to
tell about our relationship. I was left with no choice. The wait of a few weeks
converted into months. But I received no news about Suhan. I was all alone in that city. And then one day.. My brother Vishal came to visit me. He couldn't bear to
see my condition. I had eloped to marry
much against my family. But still they forgave me. Vishal told me not to stay.. ..alone in such condition. Then? He didn't come back. But I got divorce notice. Forget about him. You can easily find
another good man. I wanted to say the same dialogues
near the Brooklyn bridge, remember it? You are so sweet. Goodnight, Piya. Now papa has to leave. Don't worry. Papa will come again. But there is a change in the plan. This time I will take
your mummy along too. She isn't that bad, you know. Finger shake. Bye, sweetheart. Morning. Uncle. Suhan! What is the progress
in the mission? Suhan, what's the matter?
Is everything fine? Uncle.. we were wrong about Piya. Look.. we have committed
a grave mistake, Suhan. Now what do you want to do? What I should have done
a long time ago, uncle. I want to take up
my responsibilities. Uncle, I want to
take care of my child. Uncle, what I did was wrong. I want to rectify my mistake. Uncle, I want Piya and the baby.. both back. But.. how will you do all this? You know the job,
which you offered me. I will do it. That part has already been cast. You are a super star.
Why do you need anything? If I need you, I will find you.
Now just get out of my face. I am waiting. I am sorry.
I'll take it. I wasn't nice.. I was rude. Infact.. I was a jerk. I'm really sorry. I'll change my nature. But.. I will try to get you
an audition for another part. Come to the studio tomorrow. Suhan woke up
earlier than me that day. Piya.. ..today I am going
to start my new life. Wish me all the best. Beautiful! Are you a princess? No. But my father is very wealthy. Why don't you live here then? There will be a room
for you in such a big palace. Yes. They all also want this. But whenever I come here,
papa harps the same thing. About my marriage.
- Yes. You must have informed
them that I am coming They may think a baby sitter
is coming along with you. Of course, Agastya. In fact papa is waiting for you. Greetings Uncle. What are you doing, Agastya? He is not papa. He is our butler. Hello. Agastya here. Hi, everybody. I am home. Hi Piya! He is my friend, Agastya. Hi!
- Hi! Hello! I'm priya's uncle.
- Oh uncle! Does he have a younger brother? Does he have an elder brother? Every mother wants
the best for her baby. So do I. That's why I have chosen. Booboo diapers. Booboo diapers have
a rapid dry system.. ..with triple protection from leak. Triple protection from leak. That protects against leakage. Day and night.
- So if you have a baby. Buy Booboo. Booboo diapers is the choice. You are so good looking.
I'm sure you're an actor. No, I'm not an actor,
I'm an Astronaut from NASA Astronaut?
Travelled to moon any time? Who else is there in yourfamily?
- Actually I am alone. From my childhood I was alone,
my parents.. I am Raj Goyal. Piya's father. Pleasure meeting you. Happy anniversary.
- Thank you. Thank you. I like good manners. You know.. ..when I had come to New York. Excuse me, when I came to New York,
I had just $5 in my pocket.. With those dollars.. He is the guy who is after Piya. Today he has reached the house. Since when are you seeing him? What does the guy do?
- Who else is there in his family? Does he smoke cigarettes?
- When are you guys marrying? Next Tuesday is good to marry.
- Please! Specially with the software in.. Let me introduce my..
- Uncle, let me guess. He is Vishal,
your son and Piya's brother? Correct. How did you know?
- Piya told me. And she said that you are tall,
handsome.. intelligent, good looking. I like this guy, dad. Thank you.
- Very good! You guys enjoy. I will see you later.
- Yeah, dad. Okay, dear.
- Bye. Well, I think this calls for a drink.
- I.. Champagne.
- Okay. Absolutely. Thanks. Hi. I am Jaggu, Piya's cousin. Even I want to be
an astronaut like you. Wow! Yummy! So this Agastya.. ..you didn't tell us
anything about him before. Mom, now you too
behave like everybody.. What do you expect darling? For the first time you
have brought a guy home. He is just a friend. I don't love him. Piya.. if you want to live happily.. ..then choose the person
who loves you as your life partner. The one whom you loved.. ..he never gave you any happiness. Why do you think
that Agastya loves me? Are you serious? Can't you see what we all can see? So if you really love your child,
clearly.. Booboo diaper is the choice. Good morning,
my name is Suhan Kapoor. Every mother wants the
best for her baby. And so do I. That's the reason why
I have chosen Booboo diapers. Booboo diapers have
a rapid dry system.. ..with triple protection.. Every diaper in the town has.. The reason for why
I bought Boo Boo diapers ..is because you
can see the change Even an alien like me who doesn't
know anything can easily change it. You needn't have to wake
up your wife at midnight. To change diapers, I do. It just takes 5 seconds to change. So if you love your child,
if you love your wife.. ..then Booboo diapers
is the right choice. That was brilliant, Mr. Kapoor! As much as we want to work,
we cannot select you. What we are looking for
is a mother talking about her baby. Awoman. He asked me to come
audition for this part. I am afraid my friend, you
have come to the wrong audition. That's next door. Mr. Kapoor.. ..you have changed our
advertising campaign. For the last few days we
have auditioned hundreds of girls. But none of them have
acted so well like you have. If you love your child,
if you love your wife.. ..then Booboo diapers
is the right choice. It's brilliant! So if we change our campaign.. ..and instead of a wife and
a mother talking about her baby.. ..we will use your
idea of a father.. ..talking about his baby and wife. That's so very innovative! Mr. Kapoor, would you like
to be the face of Booboo diapers? Thank you, sir. This is the study.
- Okay. And that is Vishal's room. You can pick anything
you like from his wardrobe. I think it should
fit you just fine. Agastya. My parent.
- What a beautiful painting! When grandpa had
proposed to granny.. ..then he had captured
this romantic moment. That's very romantic!
- And this is the same ring. See. Yeah. You get ready. We are waiting
for you downstairs. - Okay. Hello.
- Can I speak to Piya please? Who is calling?
- Richa. Hey, Richa! Where are you?
You have disappeared. Forget about me, tell me about you. I saw you with an
handsome man yesterday. He is Champu.
You didn't recognize him? Who? Champu? Yeah. Champu from college. That handsome! You lucky girl! Oh no! Nothing like that. Oh really? Yes! He still loves
the girl about.. ..whom he was crazy in the college. You were that girl. Piya.. ..will you marry me? Yeah! No! No!
- Come on! Come on! - No! "You have crossed your limit." "What have you done." "You've made him go mad on you." "I used to love her." "She was my classmate." "She always used
to be upset with me." "She used to ignore me." "She used to ignore me." "Can't you see?
He is in love with you." "Say I do. I do. I do." "Sister, say yes.
Say yes! Say yes!" "Say yes! Say yes! Say yes!" "Give your consent." "Covertly and coyly say yes." "Give your consent." "Covertly and coyly say yes." "Give your consent." "By a gesture or a sign." "Give your consent." Ladies & Gentlmen, meet

of Piya and Suhani. But Sohan,
what will you say to Agastya? I'll tell the truth. I was the one who
committed the mistake. I'm ready for any
punishment she hands to me. Very good! I accept it. Sohan! Sohan! I want to tell you something. You will be so happy. See this! Sorry. Look. I got engaged to Piya. She is going to be my wife. Congratulations. Our mission was a success. Piya has got engaged to Agastya. They are going to marry very soon. Now there is no need to worry. Everything is over. Sohan, don't accept defeat so soon. I have a brilliant idea. You do one thing.
- No, uncle. Not today. Today don't give
me any of your ideas. You have always
given me wrong advice. Today I am not going
to listen to you. How had Piya wronged us? She had not done anything. And I.. I have only given her sorrows. Now it's enough. I have seen Piya. She is very happy. Agastya loves her a lot. And he will always keep her happy. Because he is not like me. His love.. ..is not changing with
the circumstances like me. Do you know.. ..when he came to
know that Priya loves.. ..somebody else..
still his love didn't change. When he came to know that
Piya has married somebody.. ..still his love didn't change. And when he came to
know that Piya has a child.. ..still his love didn't change. Uncle.. Agastya's love for
Piya will never wane. He is really a messiah. And I.. I never could make Piya happy. But I can at least.. ..let her stay happy. Yes. Yes. Who is it? You got your love Piya. I've kept my promise. My role ends here. You don't need me any more. I'm sure you'll take
good care of Piya. Take care of yourself. Suhan went away. Me too. I and Piya were
to be married shortly. I shifted to Piya's parental home. Any one with wife and child
BooBoo diaper is the choice. Suhan decided to go back to India after
completing the modeling assignment. "There are a hundred pains.." "There are a hundred
ways of relief.." "I have got everything,
my love.." "Only you aren't there.." "There are a hundred pains.." "There are a hundred
ways of relief.." "I have got everything,
my love.." "Only you aren't there.." Without Suhan I was
just a soul less body. Neither I could
talk freely with Piya, nor keep her happy. I wanted Suhan to come and save me. "This breeze that
blows haltingly.." "Why is it so indifferent.." "On the busy streets.." "I come flying.." "There are a hundred ways.." "But there is no way for me.." 'There are a hundred pains.." "There are a hundred
ways of relief.." "I have got everything,
my love.." "Only you aren't there.." "The hearts says, forget it.." "Let the time stand still.." "If the sea has turned.." "Let the waves
stay as they are.." "I have a hundred delights.." "Only you aren't there.." "There are a hundred pains.." "There are a hundred
ways of relief.." Vishal, you had promised me..
- Zubin, just take it easy. Priya will marry with me. Hi brother-in-law. Come join us for a drink. Just one drink, brother-in-law.
- No, I don't drink. One drink. One drink.
- You shouldn't say that. This man is your brother-in-law. And when brother-in-law
says you should drink.. ..then you should. Here. If this brother-in-law gets angry.. ..your plight will
be the same as that.. ..of Piya's first husband. What happened? Didn't you know? - No Piya had divorced
because of Vishal. Because of him.
- Zubin, you are drunk. You don't believe me?
You don't believe me? I'll just show you.
- Zubin! Zubin, just take it easy. All those letters that Piya's.. ..husband had written for Piya. But not one of these
letters reached Piya. Vishal had hidden
all these letters here. He didn't even give
the two a chance to reunite. Scoundrel.
- Shut up Zubin. It was another
matter with that guy. He was good for nothing. But he is not like that. I'm sure he will
take good care of Piya. Am I right?
- Yes. Cheers. Hi son. I'm back. I have brought something foryou. Do you want to see what it is? Here. This is foryou. Oh. You don't recognise me? Here. Here. Here. Here. Here. Now do you recognise? This is last time
that I can see you. I thought I'll take you with me. Then later on take
your mother also. But I have to go alone. Wth all plans failing miserably. Will you hear my words? When you grow up.. ..don't be like me.. ..be like your mother. All your plans failed. So you have stooped to this? Visha.
- Dad. Last time too I was
quiet because of you. That is why all this has happened. He has come to kidnap the child. No. I will hand
him over to the police. Otherwise he will..
- Vishal, enough is enough. Suhan is part of our family.
Let him go. No need to call police. Suhan.. ..it's your child too. I can understand your position. But this isn't the right way. If you want the child's custody.. ..fight it out legally in the court. ..we will bind by
the court's judgment. Security.. ..escort him out. Suhan committed a grave mistake. But that mistake was not his fault. He too is a victim of
misunderstanding created by Vishal. I know that Suhan loves you a lot. And you love him too. I don't know how
I have fallen in between. How can you love me? I am only Champu. An idiot. I can't even talk to you properly. And then you.. ..haven't fallen in
love with me but with Suhan. Whatever I said to you. Whatever I did for you. That was not me, but Suhan. I am only the body. Wherever I met you, Suhan was with me. You both are made for each other. Suhan loves you a lot. He feels that you
are not happy with me. He left everybody
for your happiness. He will be shattered
without you Piya. He needs you. He loves you a lot. Without you he is incomplete. No one has spoken
like this about Suhan. No one has spoken
like this about Suhan. Please don't stop. I like to hear good about him. He's a good person. Please don't stop. He loves you a lot. Hello! Hi Vikas! When did you come?
- Last night. Any job for me?
- Not much to offer. Any role will do,
even side roles.. I've an offer for Bhojpuri film?
- That is also okay to me. What a great shot!
Come let's have a drink. Autograph please! Piya! How come you are here? I've lot to explain..
- Please don't tell me anything. We can't wait any more. Champu, I know that
you are here only. Come out.
- No Suhan, my role ends here. I've to go now,
my place is some where else. Thank you. She's the only woman you loved. How did you then
fall in love with me? You'll get the answers
when you speak to Piya and Suhan. It's 8 now and they will
be at home, let's call them. Switch it on. Happy birthday, Suhan! Thank you, Champu. Not Champu. Agastya. I am in the space. Where had you disappeared? It's a long, long story.
I will tell you some other time. But where is Piya? Fool! Now let her go.
She has now become your bhabhi. Shut up!
Just call Piya! Just call Piya! Piya!
- Yes. Come here, Piya! What happened?
- There is a surprise for you. The surprise better be good. Oh my God!
Champu, where had you disappeared? Come out first. I want to give both
of you a surprise. Are you ready for it?
- Do it soon! - Shut up! My girl friend Zinkova
- Zinkova? Zinkova? Do you remember? I told you
there will seven look alike people. She's Piya. Wow! She looks exactly like me! I mean I look exactly like you. Oh my God! Yes!
Suhan, she looks exactly like me! It will be wonderful
if we could just meet. We are going to be
in the next 6 months. We'll be back on Earth.
So you should come and see me. Yes! But you must come to Mumbai first! Yes! Yes!
We will definitely come to Mumbai! Zinkova, I am a big TV star. You know he is really funny.
That is his sense of humour. I will kill you! He keeps talking
about you all the time. How old are you? Yes! You must take care of Agastya! You know we absolutely love him! I can't believe it
This is like a dream. Yes! Take care of yourself! what's up everybody this is danny and today i partnered with qualcomm to give you an early look at the samsung galaxy book go this is a new entry-level laptop powered by the brand new qualcomm snapdragon 7c gen 2. i'm excited for this platform because it brings a lot of features customers deserve in affordable laptops and it's one of the major reasons this laptop starts at only 349 the galaxy book go will be one of many affordable options being powered by the qualcomm snapdragon 7c gen 2 this year and will even see chromebooks being powered by this platform so it's going to be a great year for budget laptops i couldn't do an unboxing because this is an early unit but i've been using this for a couple of days now and you get a lot for the price point so let's take a look at the hardware and we'll talk about who this laptop is actually for the design is clean it has a matte finish and only comes in the silver color which looks nice it's fairly thin and it's light and it fits into a backpack with no problem so i can see this being a great first laptop for students the build is all plastic so it's natural that there's going to be some flex it's not a deal breaker it's exactly what i expected at this price point but it feels durable and the laptop is shockproof which is surprising for this price point because this laptop is light it doesn't quite pass the one finger test but it is easy to open and respect on the hinge quality though there's some good resistance when you move it so it's not going anywhere and you also have a lot of flexibility on the angle that you can set it at because it can go completely flat on the surface if you need it to and there's even a shortcut on the keyboard to flip the orientation on the bottom there are dual speakers with dolby atmos support and some rubber feet to help grip the surface the display is a 14 inch 1080p lcd so you get a nice amount of screen real estate they did keep the bezel slim towards the side so i think the design overall looks great we'll talk more about the screen later on in the video and you also get a 720p webcam for video calls which is more important than ever these days here is a sound test of the laptop speakers and video tests so you can get an idea here is an audio sample from the galaxy book go and with qualcomm's audio technology this should sound great so let me know what you think of the audio quality next let's talk about ports on the left a usb c port led light headphone jack and mic combo and a micro sd card for easy storage expansion on the right there's a security slot usb 2.0 port another usbc port which can be used for external displays and a sim tray which is awesome because even at an affordable price point you can have a 5g connection on the go the lowest price point will be wi-fi only the one that i'm testing here has lte on board so there will be different configurations available depending on the region that you live in the chiclet style keyboard is comfortable to type on it has a nice bounce to it i think most people will be happy with it it's what i expected with the combo function keys at the top but it's not backlit so that's something that you should know the trackpad is a nice size as well it's much bigger than i thought it would be which i appreciate and it's running windows precision drivers so it's nice and responsive and smooth and the multi-touch works well so no complaints here after using it for a few days so why i'm so excited about the qualcomm snapdragon 7c gen 2 platform powering this is because it gives the laptop some big advantages first because it's always on it behaves more like your smartphone so when you open it up it's immediately ready to use which is awesome second it's always connected you can get a galaxy book go with 5g connectivity here in the us so you'll never miss a notification or email i've been testing this on t-mobile and even with lte i saw some very respectable speeds i mean i know a lot of people don't even have this type of speed at home so this is perfect for getting work done on the road and the qualcomm modem will automatically switch between secure wi-fi and lte so you will always have a secure connection there are no interruptions it's seamless third is the power to watt ratio this is an eight core cryo cpu clocked up to 2.55 gigahertz and you are getting plenty of power for everyday tasks qualcomm states that we're getting about a 10 boost in performance over the competing chipsets in this class and this runs cool and whisper quiet because it doesn't have a fan it doesn't need one the configuration i have here is the one with four gigabytes of ram and 128 gigabytes of eufs storage but there will be a model available with eight gigabytes of ram browsing is great on the edge browser since it's arm optimized now and productivity apps like microsoft excel powerpoint and word work fantastic too so this will be great for students and with the power of the adreno graphics on board you can even enjoy some games too i was able to play one of my favorite games smoothly here very responsive you can hook up your favorite bluetooth controller too if you want now don't expect to play anything outside of mobile games here because you aren't going to be playing triple a titles but it's great to have this type of flexibility for downtime possibly the best thing about the qualcomm snapdragon 7c gen 2 powering this is the battery life i've been using this for the last two days and i still have yet to charge it with regular use the estimates here say that over 12 hours with cellular connectivity on so that is very respectable i can definitely get used to this type of battery life and what's awesome is you don't need anything special to charge this laptop with you can use the same power brick that you use on your phone and it will do just fine and a power brick and usbc cable comes in the box when you buy one so i want to talk about who this laptop is for because me personally i'm excited about the choices that we're getting as consumers because not everybody can afford or needs the most expensive laptop not everyone's doing professional work they just might need something reliable that they can use every day to stay productive and i think this could be the perfect fit i'm going to be using this more for the next couple of weeks to bring you a full review because i don't think it'd be fair to do conclusive testing on an early unit but i'm going to be giving this to my son afterwards because i think it's a perfect fit for his first laptop with all the virtual schooling that is happening and the need for him to learn how to type and get familiar with windows 10. he picked it up really fast he's only seven but he started using the track pad with no problems and started to look up flags of the world because that's what he's into right now so i'm curious to see how he adapts to the galaxy book go i think the price point of 349 is perfect because it's affordable it's light enough to travel with and if it takes a drop or two i feel like it will survive because of the construction and it competes right there with the ipad for education and you're getting a full computer here so i can see this being a hit for the classroom another person that i think this laptop is for is for the samsung fan that is looking for a laptop that works within the ecosystem i like the fact that things like smartthings and smartthings find are on here so you can locate your samsung connected devices if you have a samsung tablet then you can easily use it for a second display with your galaxy book go so this could help you work from home or with your new home office setup bluetooth devices like the galaxy buttons pro show up easily and are seamless to pair your galaxy phone can also link to windows so you can use your android apps on your laptop you can also access your photo library easily you can also get text and notifications too and one of the best features called quick share is here too so you can easily transfer files and pictures to your laptop from your galaxy devices it's a great ecosystem considering what you're paying for this laptop you get so much but i think the expectations need to be set based on the price point because the positives definitely outweigh the negatives and there's a great balance of features on this laptop to make it worth it but let me nitpick here for a second there are a few things that i wish it did have a fingerprint scanner would have been nice instead of just a power button a combo one would have been cool i wish it did have a backlit keyboard that would have been convenient and i wanted a little better viewing angle and brightness on the tft display don't get me wrong at the right angle the display looks good as you can see here i have watched a few movies on this but anyone who has seen a display like this before knows what to expect with viewing angles so i don't think it's a deal breaker but i thought that i would share so you would know what to expect when you pick one up so let me know what you want to see in the next follow-up video do you want to see performance tests app compatibility photo editing you let me know what you want to see compatibility with arm on windows is something that i'm watching closely it hasn't been moving as fast as i wanted to but the insider build should be public soon with better compatibility later this year but i really appreciate what qualcomm is doing to help accelerate this process they have a snapdragon developer kit coming that will help get their programs ready for the snapdragon platform they're already working with key partners like zoom for better extended battery life on laptops with snapdragon these chipsets like the qualcomm snapdragon 7c gen 2 will help bring many more entry level laptops to the market making them more popular and hopefully this means good news for the adoption of arm on windows i'm optimistic so let me know what you think in the comments below so are you picking one of these up i will leave a link down below for more information and where you can buy one wi-fi only will be available first and then the 5g model will be available later this year but internationally i'm assuming that you can pick up an lte model first with the qualcomm x15 integrated lte modem like the one that i have here thumbs up for this early look and subscribe for a lot more videos like this and i will see you guys in the next one are you winning [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] she's only five [ __ ] i'm bout to [ __ ] this cutie so i whip out my katana and i knock this little [ __ ] out with just one hit like i'm saitama why you act like you [ __ ] like little [ __ ] i don't want drama i still hit when she says no don't understand what she don't wanna hey sword fighting with my penis like i'm in a [ __ ] dojo all

[ __ ] you can call me spike lee putting on fire getting ice [ __ ] i'm total rocky to say that you could say it to me is so tight [Music] she's only five so apparently a young hustler can't work on his minecraft let's play in peace without his twitter timeline spouting even more horny not that i'm complaining whatsoever if you've been on this channel long enough you know 2d is supreme and i'll shrimp on your waifu any day of the week today is monday and y'all have decided that samsung's new virtual assistant sam is worthy of shrimping over and let me tell you the second i saw what all the fuss was about aha i came in my she's in my pants 2 000 likes and i will pull up samsung girl rule 34 on a samsung smart fridge smash that like button dick slap it in the face will ya let's get into your mistresses origin story light farm is an animation company that pixar ain't got [ __ ] on they decided to give us heaven on earth on behalf of samsung mobile corporate giant that angel that'll go demon soon as your parents are gone and you've locked the door behind you goes by sam no sung just sam and thanks to the speed and efficiency of rule 34 artists it's now cool to have a samsung and i'll be talking about you fake samsung fans in a bit here but first i want to talk about sam herself this isn't just another storyboarded wife who handed to us from an anime we enjoy or a video game we play this is a real virtual assistant that adheres to our every command cause this is samsung's revenge porn on apple's siri or google's google assistant which means that we can directly interact with her you can tell her to call you master call you papi good boy whatever degenerate nickname gets you going sam works herself like an absolute goddess they knew exactly what we needed that choreography absolutely unmatched i'd let her bite me how about you another thing that the rise of this chick has told me is that there are two kinds of people in this world horny people and fake people when was the last time you saw people this excited about samsung it ha it's not no no forget tech nerds like myself or muda or all those android youtube channels nobody has ever been this excited about samsung all of you ass hats with iphones shat on us made memes of us and now you want a piece of our pie a little bit of dummy mommy milkers that only sam can hand out no i will not allow it this is why you don't have the jiggle physics app on your phone android is truly supreme also remember when the samsung galaxy note 7 was exploding it seemed to me like samsung already knew of her she was probably already in that phone ready to serve your needs but the phone spontaneously combusted she was clearly like too hard to handle i don't know why samsung had to do a whole cover up and recall the phone them just being upfront that our new found virtual waifu was too sexy would have been fine in the press they're pressing themselves to her anyway and you know jacking off to that rule 34 i'm getting sidetracked but point is that samsung girl got me hot i want to [ __ ] the samsung girl finally it's cool to own a samsung took y'all long enough [ __ ] y'all fake fans though i see you guys it's really time for apple and google to clap back with some virtual assistant waifus i would i would love to see a siri with big mommy milkers google assistant with big mommy google chrome already has big mommy milkers go watch my last video but that's pretty much it don't forget to throw away your used coomb tissues hill gang i'm gonna go back to editing my minecraft let's play follow me on twitter lads just look at it that is that's ridiculous so as i've been making other videos over the last few months i've also been gathering seven of the rarest strangest smartphones you've ever seen so number seven is the galaxy s4 zoom i got a bit lucky with this one i logged on to ebay and it was sitting in front of me but this is a special phone because while it might seem like just a standard 2013 device from the front turn it over and you realize we've got a bit of an imposter on our hands but do you wanna know the crazy part all of this stuff is just there so that this phone can have 10 times optical zoom the modern day galaxy s21 ultra also has 10 times optical zoom it's just this one doesn't look like it's been let loose in an all-you-can-eat buffet samsung wasn't wrong about zoom being a key selling point in the future it's just that soon after this phone came out companies figured out a more efficient way of doing it see the traditional method and how it was done on the s4 zoom as well as just generally point and shoot cameras is to have a whole load of stacked bits of glass that by changing the distance between them can magnify things without losing quality but then came the eureka moment of multiple cameras what if instead of just one camera that you have to put all of this movable glass in front of so it can reach all of these different magnifications we just have two fixed cameras one that can capture a wide view and one that can capture that zoomed view this worked so well that in 2021 every single smartphone uses this technology and if we test these two phones side by side i mean obviously we are comparing 2013 to 2021 here but it's just cool that we're now at a stage where in most aspects this clever engineering paired with a bit of software magic can outperform last gen's pure optics number six is the no phone number six is the no phone and it kind of looks like the pinnacle of stupidity but it worked and thanks to huel for sponsoring this video ouch so this is the packaging and it's probably its best feature no literally you can do more things with the bag it came in than the thing itself and is it just me or does this no phone look suspiciously like another not so innovative device but what this company did is played on the growing sentiment that tech is ruining our lives they said to people do you feel the constant urge to have your phone with you to which most people probably said yes do you wish you could be less attached to it to which most people probably also said yes the solution is simple hold our thing instead people bought their vision this idea that the no phone was effectively the anti smartphone how its branded is taking zero megapixel photos and having zero gigabytes of storage and how it's toilet bowl resistant because it's a sheet of plastic it was fully funded on kickstarter the creators were invited to all manner of interviews and even a ted talk and they're still selling them today six years later although when i tried to get one there was a serious stock shortage and it took them like an extra month to get it to me but that's even crazier they're selling bundles the couple's cure the family plan even the employee gift pack and they released a follow-up device i really wish i was joking but this is an actual product and i'm just out here trying to think what would the returns process look like on this hey uh my no phone air doesn't seem to be working ah let me have a look [Music] seems good to me um okay i don't really like this phone can i can i just get my money back why of course just please return the device first i just it's right here with all due respect sir that is your hand [Music] number four imagine this headline ex-apple ceo starts his own phone company and not just any apple ceo this was john scully the guy who who kind of replaced steve jobs back in the day and his idea was interesting that most 200 budget devices at the time were purely functional they had little to no attention given to hardware design or even software design so scully created the company ob with the goal of producing phones that had that apple brag factor that designed in silicon valley coolness but for emerging markets like india and africa and just given the fact that apple has got such a reputation for only doing things when they know they're going to be huge the sky was the limit here and i'd even go as far as to say that the presentation was promising it was a great demonstration of how the company could make something both premium and practically priced it's just for a fashion focus device it sure does look an awful lot like a toilet seat the bottom is rounded the top is flat it generally looks like the company built a rounded phone first and then realized wait a second this just looks like every other phone make it different and i think this kind of mentality is also what led them to a screen that is raised above the rest of the phone i think the idea was to prevent your fingers resting on the display itself but yes this is as impractical as it looks more fundamentally though if you're entering a new market with a new product and a new brand then the one thing that you've got to absolutely make sure you're doing is solving a problem that people are having because yes you could argue they have built a cooler phone for people who like toilets but for the majority of the markets they were targeting being visually unique was far from the primary concern so it flopped they went back to the drawing board relaunched and it flopped again and it wasn't long before john scully just straight up started denying his involvement with the company pretty fun story but now is where things start to get really curious this is the k1 impulse marketed as the most secure device on the planet and i got to start by saying this is easily top 5 smartphone unboxing experiences that i've probably ever had so if we take off the wrapper and the sleeve we're left with two magnetic doors and inside them is everything you could possibly expect but also everything that you probably didn't we've got the phone which says privacy is the new order feels like i'm joining a cult we've got a beefy insert with a whole menu of paperwork as well as a very unusually shaped case and of course you can take this layer off and as well as just a charger and a usbc cable you get a full three-course meal of travel adapters but then we go back to the top layer again and you find a carbon fiber wireless charging pad a pair of really quite high-end wireless earphones with a display on top that shows battery percentage and then take off this middle part and you've got three private keys which will make sense in a minute and then uh what what is this if anyone has any idea just let me know and if you thought it couldn't get any stranger well i mean just look at it long story short this may come as a surprise after that ridiculously embellished unboxing experience but this phone was a scam the company had built their own supposedly ultra secure crypto data os these keys you're actually meant to plug them into the phone so you can enter your own secure vault and it's the weirdest thing they tried to legitimize their own security by inviting people to hack them first thing you see on this website is hackers for a million dollars could you ever imagine like any legitimate company doing this and their number one selling point was that this was the first and only phone to run voice over blockchain protocol or vob i mean if we're all inventing words here then a sub to the channel would be pleb you've probably heard a fair bit about the blockchain it's the basis of bitcoin but at its core it's just a decentralized way of storing data so that it doesn't belong to any one single person or company but the issue with blockchain is that it's just not very well understood by most so this company basically tried to use that ambiguity to make it seem like it had almost magical properties they said to people things like you get unlimited storage for free because blockchain anyways just before this phone came out the guys behind it were suspected of a scam involving cryptocurrency and it was bad timing because all of a sudden people were like wait a second is anything they said actually true and sure enough under scrutiny it turns out that the private keys were just flash drives almost every article covering the launch was a paid article by the company and in the name of supposed security most basic smartphone features like gmail social media and even importing contacts did not work and for everyone who messaged their helpline to try and get some support on this they either got completely blanked or they got given a 200 word essay on how these were the necessary precautions needed for vobop to work also i'm getting the sinking feeling that what they've actually done here is just bought a cheap phone from china and then stuck this fancy casing around it and made it their own because otherwise why does this look suspiciously like a 3d printed cutout and why else would it have not one but two sets of bezels it's very suspicious and customers soon started to worry that by buying this phone and by having used it to manage their own cryptocurrency wallets they'd inadvertently given the company behind this phone full access to their crypto accounts and so they were worried that this company could effectively steal their money which they were suspected of in this other scam and then remotely brick their device with a software update pretty scary stuff okay number two is rare so rare that i couldn't find a single unopened one of these on the entire internet and the only one that i could find literally came delivered to me in a lunchbox the ultimate and reusable packaging i guess it's just it's just a shame that there are no sandwiches included welcome to the turing phone and i've got to say apart from the fact that this kind of feels like holding a pair of scissors on the wrong end i think it looks gorgeous it's an almost modular aesthetic with each panel having a slightly different soft touch matte finish with one of them just straight up dragon scale texture it's weird that it works but i think it does work and the whole thing is apparently built from liquid morphium which is stronger than steel but what is it well picture this it's 2015 we've had the galaxy s6 the iphone 6s but touring robotic industries just comes out of nowhere and says hold up we've got a phone that not just outspects them but is encrypted to keep your privacy i wonder where we've heard that one before these phones did get made or at least like a few of them did but most sources say that not a single one got delivered to customers somewhere along the line i think it really hit this company just how hard it is to make a fully working smartphone and how they really needed more than the 50 employees they had to do it you know of all markets i'd be willing to bet that the smartphone market is probably one of the hardest for new companies to enter it feels like everyone wants a stab at it but at the same time eighty percent of the market is controlled by literally six companies anyways where this gets interesting is that after the turing phone didn't work out during robotic industries kind of started to fall into a bit of a downward spiral they'd lost some of their reputation so what do they do they try to tease an even more extreme phone to stay on people's minds the turing phone cadenza with get this an imax 6k quad camera a super capacitor battery paired with a hydrogen fuel cell and dual snapdragon 830 chips which are products that never actually existed and so when that too inevitably ended up with nothing they went even crazier they changed their name to touring space industries and teased something called the hubble phone with you know it's not even worth going through the spec sheet it didn't happen and so the supposed encryption and the liquid morpheme that we're getting here well i'm having my doubts but no one's tested it because no one got the phone if you look at this company's bio they describe themselves as a mobile technology company which develops technologies based on decentralized authentication methodology using static key exchange with an anonymous key distribution infrastructure point is the one thing to take away from this video is that if a company can't tell you what they're doing for you in simple terms then there's a pretty good chance that they're trying to hide something also fun fact i found a reddit thread from someone who applied to work for these guys and as part of his interview he was tasked with doing what seems an awful lot like their job for them they basically gave him like a two week long assignment which involved building an app from scratch with a really specific set of functions clever but very sneaky okay finally the thinnest smartphone in the world i knew i wanted to see one of these in person i just i had no idea how to get one i literally i set up ebay alerts in case anyone listed one i've trawled through sites like aliexpress and gearbest probably once every two weeks in case any seller found they still had inventory nothing and so just before i was about to pretty much ditch the entire video idea i thought let me just message vivo just in case no expectations and so i did and they even warned me like this is probably not gonna happen the phone is long discontinued but one month later i was just doing something completely different and i got an out the blue email saying we found it and here we are so this is the vivo x5 max it's a pretty understated package for a phone with this prestigious a title you get the device on top and then earphones charger and manuals let's do this [Music] clearly the outer plastic wasn't built to wait seven years okay let me give you some perspective the rog phone five is 10.3 millimeters thick the oneplus 9 is 8.7 millimeters thick the iphone 12 mini this tiny thing is 7.4 millimeters thick this is 4.75 the phone feels almost two-dimensional compared to what i'm used to i'm pretty sure i've had rulers that are thicker than this but do you wanna know the funny part they've still managed to get a headphone jack on there you can actually see that the metal trim of the phone is so narrow that they've had to cut into the back plate just so it fits which goes to show that if a company wants to put a headphone jack on a phone they can put a headphone jack on the phone and the crazy part of this is that this is 2015. could you imagine if we wanted to build the thinnest phone in the world now in 2021 with all our performance and efficiency improvements we could probably make a better phone that's 3.75 millimeters but it's just that priorities have changed in 2021 people want advanced camera systems and 5g and big batteries and all of these things lead to bulkier phones plus i just i feel like being this thin is a little counterintuitive because it's so thin that it's more likely to break but if you then put a case on it it's not thin it's still a beautiful bit of tech to look at and still an engineering marvel but i reckon if a company released a really thin phone today then tons of people would flock to go and see it but very few of them would actually follow through and buy it okay this is huell i've actually been drinking this stuff for like four years before the company actually reached out and wanted to sponsor something but here we are so when you buy huel you're basically buying a whole meal in powder form you get a free shaker with it and to make it you literally just add water and shake and it's actually built so that you don't even need to pour it into anything you drink it from the shaker it's healthy like almost the entire ingredients list is just oats peas coconuts grains it's got tons of protein 26 essential vitamins and minerals and it tastes surprisingly good and the one i've switched to recently is the new black edition which is the exact same concept but with 33 more protein and 50 less carbs so give it a try i have left a link down below and if you order through there you get not just the fuel and the shaker but also a heel t-shirt they are very nice t-shirts anyways thank you so much for watching my name is aaron this is mr who's the boss and i'll catch you in the next one you yo what's good i'm manny that is my wife diana right over there and samsung sent me over the galaxy s21 ultra 5g to test how to see what i can do with it so i'm going to take some urban portraits of my wife with the phone and also this entire video is going to be filmed on the s21 ultra so right now we are using director's view and allows me to use both cameras the front facing and the rear camera at the same time and it's so cool because i could change the focal length i can go wide medium and telephoto that's pretty dope so i'm going to show you how i set up my shot so initially i like this this scene right here right shooting her straight on symmetrical but look right here do you see that on this side i don't like that that's empty space no bueno i want the frame to be filled so if i go on this side right here i got the same issue i got on this side there's sky i feel like it's unbalanced so to solve this problem i'm going to move slightly to the left angle down i pretty much fill the frame with the tracks and i'm going to put her right there when you are using portrait mode the most important thing is to make sure that the box over the person's face is yellow and that it says ready the best part about the artificial background blur that you're getting from the s21 ultra is how realistic it looks for example look at the edges of these photos it's super clean [Music] i'm using director's view again and this is the shot that captivated me i'm gonna use the ultra wide angle lens on this camera and i love i love that look you see what that looks like that looks amazing the problem is that i'm shooting backlit the sun's that way it's facing me and what happens when you shoot backlit sometimes you don't get saturated color now i'm going to change position and i'm going to shoot on this side of the tree where the sun is acting as my main light okay and now with diana right there using the sun is the main light not only do you get that nice bright saturated blue sky but now it brings out the color out of [Music] everything with this 108 megapixel camera um i can tap on diana's face and when i tap on it i'm able to adjust the exposure a tad i'm going to make it look tad darker because i feel like it's really bright and then when i tap the lock here it locks my exposure in and now all i have to do is just focus on taking pictures i don't have to worry about it fluctuating getting bright getting darker alright here we go ready one two three [Music] [Music] all right so the galaxy s21 ultra has some crazy stable video it's almost like a gimbal and uh we're gonna go ahead and demonstrate that for you right now [Music] [Music] the samsung galaxy s21 ultra 5g can also shoot 8k video but with the ak video for content creators especially it does it has 8k snap which is basically it gets a still frame of that 8k video a high quality still frame which is great for thumbnails or behind the scenes photos of what you were doing so for example diana is going to take a little ak video with me maybe i'll do a little jump and she's going to screen grab it right right and she's going to use the 8k snap feature to capture me in action work it work it [Music] before using the s21 ultra i mean i expected it to be good i heard a lot of great things about it on youtube but i didn't expect it to be this good the photos were extremely detailed with 108 megapixel camera the background blur in portrait mode looked very realistic the best portrait mode that i've ever used on a phone period on the video side of things you have the 8k video you have the ak snap which is great for getting behind the scene photos but the super steady it looked like i literally had the phone on a gimbal that kind of blew me away huge thanks goes out to samsung for allowing me to put the s21 ultra's camera through its paces i think the photos speak for themselves the internet is going wild right now twitter is going insane and it's all because of yet another cgi girl first we had lady d from resident evil people were going insane about her and now it's the new samsung assistant girl samsung may introduce new virtual assistant called sam if you guys have a samsung if you use samsung we have bixby and bixby is terrible it's abysmal it's the worst virtual assistant ever but now it looks like people were talking about sam this company decided to give a nice face for sam samsung is going to launch a new virtual assistant called sam and it looks beautiful here she is this is quote unquote sam doesn't she look like the girl from b movie so the team was working on this project the angles here she's winking why exactly do people always gotta hyper sexualize anything on the internet you have a cute girl here and people are going wild over this people are talking about switching from apple just so they can use the virtual assistant on samsung but it gets even weirder people are so obsessed with this girl that now there's subreddits that have over a hundred thousand people following it in one day look at this hottie samantha a tick-tock account would you look at the time it's time to get a samsung who gave her the cat ears why are we giving her cat is wanna play some games they put a monster energy drink and a playstation please stop it [Music] okay let's get into the origins of uh good old samantha here on may 28 2021 the brazilian visual arts production house light farm presents a series of 3d renders of a virtual assistant dressed in the black samsung shirt okay so here are the pictures you know she's looking good look at that peace signs this isn't even this isn't official they did this out of the goodness of their hearts in addition lifeform also uploaded short test clip of the model the clip is no longer available don't worry i got you okay it's available somewhere we'll find it here's the short test clip you see this oh oh it's so everything's so funny okay are you seeing what's popping up over here so when they originally talked about this light farm live from posted a tweet this is the tweet here that they deleted samsung's virtual assistant decided to update the visual and we gave her a little help the character which already had a 2d existing version underwent a complete redesign to return to social networks in a 3d version they did this on their own this isn't an actual samsung thing they did it on their own and now people are going crazy how the internet works it gets creepy at some point let's continue looking here how did it spread so on the 29th this person tweeted four images of the character misrepresenting it as the virtual model for samsung and it had 49 000 likes so here's the tweet here this new 3d version of virtual model from samsung gave me good ideas oh look at the face just like everything in the worlds all of the horny men and thirsty women decided to you know i want to f the samsung girl come on it's not even real wait your phone has how many gigabytes that's so small lol what is this i was going through twitter and there's so many lewd photos of this samsung girl check this out we have people already doing cosplay look look there's more's cosplay so alice what did you do today oh you know edited myself to look like the samsung virtual assistant in one day trying to look like the samsung girl why are people bored i guess people are bored they have nothing better to do except hyper sexualize a 3d inanimate person that was made by a company that is nothing to do with samsung i digress there's more going on here don't worry fun fact this isn't official apparently some beautiful firm named lightfirm did it out of their own volition with zero commission i'm a samsung guy i like samsung but i don't like it enough to be dominated by samsung because we have dominatrix versions of the samsung girl what is the internet without making huge proportions for the samsung girl we got giant boobs we have a tiny waist and the biggest bum whoa now is someone horny on main what are you talking about no i you know what i don't want to get banned today so we're not going to show that one how about we've already seen this one we've already seen how they added the cat ears because obviously what's an e-girl without cat ears am i right here's another good one here we got the reference photo and then we have this person had to make a doodle for sam the virtual assistant people all have already made these crazy renditions of this girl what ever happened to um lady d remember people were going crazy about her make there were mods of lady d from um resident evil now people don't want to play with her anymore you know nobody cares lady d i don't want to play with you anymore i don't want to play with you anymore now we got sam the virtual assistant we're moving up in life okay okay oh lady d is not happy about this lady d is not happy i would never be a simp nope not interested in that but then you got at your service my queen of course oh this is good samsung virtual assistant is taking over look at this iphone 2007 to 2021 guys are you still gonna be using an iphone when we have like this sam here the virtual assistant come on everyone pose over the dead graves it's yours whatever game you're playing it won't work you can't defeat me no i know [Music] what is this look at look at look at the recommended videos oh my god if people gave this much attention to world hunger it would end in a day we could have flying cars can you imagine if you put this much time and effort into anything else in the world we'd be thriving as a society i tweeted this six hours ago and i was like why does a samsung assistant person look like a lead a battle angel tell me they're not the same person have you seen this movie it's a it's a leader the better angel like if she had a part-time job i think samsung right now not even kidding i think they're trying to scrub the internet of anything to do with this person sam this is the studio that designed sam it's all gone every single post that they posted about sam is completely gone it's been taken down if you go on their instagram or their facebook which is where they originally posted it completely gone i have no idea so guys don't get used to this okay the internet's had its fun but this isn't gonna be a thing or maybe but probably not you can hold on to your iphones for now predictably people want to rail samsung's rejected ai mascot polygon clean it up clean it up polygon did they really use the word rail what kind of a journalist who wrote this cass marshall oh cass marshall okay so so she's not happy she's like wha why why does everyone rail the samsung mascot but they don't want to rail me okay cass clean it up ask the entire article well thanks cass for the informative article frank jesus cass [Music] oh my god my eyes my eyes are bleeding thank you [Music] yes exciting day here we have got our hands on the brand new s21 products from samsung as you can see in front of me is the s21 ultra 5g the s21 5g i also have a couple pairs of galaxy buds pro which are new as well i've actually got pretty much every single variant of the s21 ultra and the uh regular s21 and the s21 plus let's kick it off with the ultra that's the one that i'm most excited for that's the top of the line flagship of the bunch the ultra takes things to another level it's the biggest display of the bunch coming in at 6.8 glorious inches all right here we go so check it out that is your first glance at the s21 ultra this is probably the color that i'm gonna go for to be honest i you know me when it comes to black double black like they have going on here actually they call it phantom black but i like that they went with a sort of matte finish as well it's going to be a little bit more resistant to fingerprints this glossy portion so you can see the two different types of black this kind of carries a similar reflectiveness to the frame of the device metallic around the edge what's new on this model is how they integrated the camera module unlike last year they were able to kind of blend it into the frame here which i think is a more elegant approach everybody wants the top performing camera stuff but maybe we want something that appears to look a little bit more slender from the side and they were able to do that with this curved edge around here now there is a little sticker on there remove that wow that is a comprehensive looking camera setup those are huge lenses you can see the periscope style zoom lens down here on the bottom and then the other camera modules above there on the side of the device you'll see your volume rocker in this location as well as your power switch down below there the screen protector this is a large display they brought the pen input to the s lineup so it's no longer relegated just to the note series the front-facing camera here this tiny little hole punch layout symmetrical in the center of the device on the bottom of the device here we have our usbc connector for the fast charging speakers over here as well and then this device also does feature the shared wireless charging so you can charge buds on the top of it if you choose to there is a usb type-c cable so it looks like samsung has joined the party here as far as not putting the power brick in the box and that's resulting in a slimmer package for shipment this does support fast wireless charging as well so you may want to go the wireless route if you're going to pick up another charger to go with it sim tool is also inside the package and yeah that pretty much completes the unboxing experience now let's go ahead and move over to the s21 5g so this is the smallest of the bunch so this one is coming in at 6.2 inches for the display and you can see already we have a much more colorful look right out of the gate but this is called phantom violet and what's interesting to me here is the two-tone effect which you haven't really seen very much of [Music] that's kind of a nice look to it now the texture is kind of similar this one maybe has a slightly grippier feel to it but it's also a matte finish a kind of semi-reflective finish which changes its hue a little bit depending on what it happens to be reflecting three cameras along the top and none of which are as large as on the ultra variant however that design characteristic of minimizing the camera hump by bringing the frame of the device around the back edge it exists here as well you do have your power switch and volume buttons in the same location as they exist on the ultra even though this is obviously a much smaller form factor there is a screen protector as well now just like on the ultra model you have your camera unit tiny little hole punch in the center of the frame there bottom of the device is where you'll find your usb type-c connector and your speaker modules and place that one down right there you get your sim tool you get your usb type-c cable and you're up and running first going to reach for the bigger version of this that's right over here so this is the s21 plus which actually sits between the s21 and the s21 ultra and that takes your screen size up to 6.7 inches now the specifications of course are going to be a little bit different here since the ultra is the flagship model that's where you're going to find the maximum spec with up to 16 gigs of ram am i correct is it 16 gigs that we're dealing with these days and 512 storage option that exists with the ultra if you do step down to the s21 plus then you're looking at eight gigs of ram and 256 storage so the regular s21 and s21 plus same spec it's still for most people plenty of ram but for those that want the powerhouse status that want to go ultra well that's why it's called the ultra i also have the phantom white which really grabbed my attention because of how matte it comes off and almost like sort of a pearl type of texture to it i don't know what it is for some reason this one spoke to me still a two-tone setup with a kind of polished steel around the outside the silver frame yeah there's just something about this one that sort of speaks to me now we do have another ultra variant as well this is going to be your silver and this one is probably the most interesting of all the colors available this one is much more reflective even than the violet over here so whatever happens to be in front of it is going to kind of reflect in the surface and it color shifts and changes depending on the way the light hits it so it can be anywhere from a teal to sort of a pinkish tone and it really represents a large number of colors inside of the look there this is getting wild so this one is the black variant of the s21 plus this one is also a cool color which is kind of like the black but not quite it actually comes off as like a really dark matte gray and the frame changes too which almost has like a sort of a bluish tone to it so this one they're calling phantom gray and that's available in the s21 and s21 plus check this out this is a silicone case and that's going to be for your ultra model as you can see right there now in order to accommodate this pen on the side here they actually had to extend the case on the front side so i'm going to actually go ahead and insert this right here as you can see that's how that works now i don't know if this is going to be for everyone obviously the device becomes a little bit wider but as an exchange for that you're now getting the opportunity to use a pen for your input it just pops out of there like that and of course if you've ever seen an s pen previously you kind of know how this functions now the s pen is a little bit different than previous versions that we've seen with note series there's no more clicky bit on the eraser portion or in the eraser location but it kind of makes sense this device is so big at 6.8 inches that you really could enhance your productivity through the use of the pen and the pen of course has a large number of features here everything from note taking to smart selection screen write live messages and so forth so the next case is this wallet style case and you can see it has the clear view on the front so you can actually catch your notifications and updates even when the wallet style case is closed when you have a wallet style case i think pen input becomes even more important the way you're holding it and that's just my guess but anyway i'm going to go ahead and insert the ultra model into this case now the frame of the case is actually very similar in fact it might be identical it's silicone on the outside and it has this channel on the side over here for your pen however it just has this piece glued on this hard plastic piece which turns this into a wallet as you can see right there this will show you your time battery life the date whatever notifications you have and the other thing that happens on this one is it kind of has a cool cover for the camera portion a little bit nicer maybe than the one on the plain silicone case so anyway that's the wallet case i should also mention at this point uh of course we're also going to be doing the later case for everything within this series from the ultra down to the regular s21 so go check the site i believe you can order it i think it's gone live right now and i'll have more on that coming up very shortly but if you want to be one of the first to receive an ultra slim case if that's more your style then go check that out i'll put the link in the description as well all right so since we're on an unboxing spree here we might as well reach for the buds pro as well this is silver this is blue i don't know if there's any phantom in the name one two one there's a few specifications on the back two-way speakers for rich sound active noise cancellation so that's built in five to 18 hours of play time and ipx 7 certification for durability it's the exact same kind of hue and tone so you can have the perfect outfit here i'll crack that open oh look at that all shiny and shimmery see a little led light in the center there and we have an interchangeable ear tip so usually the medium is installed that's a soft touch ear tip lets it sit a little further in the ear canal for improved performance often you will have ear tips to choose from and that's exactly what you have inside the packaging here it looks like you have a small and a large to go with the medium that's already pre-installed plus a usb type-c cable to charge that up if you don't want to use the reverse wireless charging which phone are you supposed to have to get this one i guess this can go with any one that you choose and oh yeah definitely the white one here once you see the buds themselves so it's a reflective silver and then the tips and the remainder are white so this would match really well with the phantom white model variant okay cool i'm gonna reach for the ultra model right now because that one is just calling my name this is a big phone but it actually maybe doesn't feel that big because of what they've done on the edges of the frame here the part that you're gripping is actually this thin band and the remainder curves off fairly quickly so this one obviously takes things to another level we have the latest chip in here now we have the snapdragon 875 we have an adaptive refresh rate on the display well first off how about resolution so you can see out of the box it's in 2400 by 1080 that's fhd plus you can go ahead and toggle that up to 3200 by 1440 that's wqhd plus so for those people that really appreciate the extra pixels that's a tremendous amount of resolution for a smartphone you can start to appreciate those added pixels if you use your device like that if you're more casual and whatnot you may prefer the battery savings that come through lowering the resolution which is probably why it's selected out of the box yeah sharpest visuals most battery use but i do appreciate that increased resolution available only on the ultra model and you have another option here you have the standard option which toggles back the refresh rate to 60 hertz and that's gonna be if you're more interested in preserving battery life or if you're already low on battery and you just want to juice a couple extra minutes out then you may go for the standard setting i personally will never remove the adaptive setting and so it looks like we can just straight away in the operating system here run the high resolution along with the adaptive 120 hertz so that's kind of a nice little touch why don't we go ahead and jump into the cameras here because the cameras are just pretty wild on this particular setup right here so you can actually see just in the default photo app i've got one two three four different options to select now i have my trusty plant here this is going to be your standard focal range that's number one we have a 3x zoom look at the detail now i just do the quick select of the 3x you can see i have options all the way up to 100x that become available to me on that tap of course not all optical not the whole way but the other option here 10x oh my goodness that is tremendous wow look at the look at the 10x optical get out of town that is detail i mean and i can even i can keep it going it is wow and then let me just get the wide-angle shot as well now it is a combination i mean we're sitting here on an s21 ultra which it's one of the best displays in the game as you know with the amoled and such and then we're also using the camera it's all tuned up but still that is a premium that's a flagship experience right there here comes 100 oh my goodness gracious oh my goodness gracious yeah it showed me a picture in picture to help me try to frame it that is just that is insane that mo you never even looked at your camera like that you never even looked at your camera like that that level of zoom is uh well it's kind of mind-boggling to be honest so you have hd30 fhd 30 you have fhd auto uhd 30 uhd 60 and 8k 24. if you go to super steady you are trapped in fhd rather than uhd oh baby that's steady [Music] i can tell you right now it is tremendously steady so i'm going to turn super steady off and then test out the uhd60 [Music] yeah uhd is gonna probably be the way to go for most people now it does have the crazy exotic 8k 24 fps and i am now recording 8k video wow this always gets me on a smartphone this is in the 8k mode i don't know if kurt can throw this on the timeline but it's in 8k mode so it's focused on the plant and then i lift up my hand and it's smooth and i drop it and it's the plan and it's by hand and it's the plan so it's not hunting around that's kind of a nice improvement right there in the video mode so i'm happy about that at first glance over here regular s21 s21 plus also do 8k video recording they do have a smaller battery we have a i can't believe i haven't mentioned it yet you have a 5 000 milliamp hour battery in the ultra so obviously i'm a fan of that now as expected as you move down in scale you're going to get a smaller battery so it's 4 000 on the regular s21 and 4800 on the s21 plus keep in mind you're powering a smaller display as well so it's probably going to consume less battery but still it's worth noting the biggest battery comes on the ultra model 6.8 inches and of course we have this tiny little hole punch so it barely obstructs anything yeah it looks great i mean look how vibrant this oled isn't look at that okay the benefit here of having this tiny little hole punch is you're getting more bang for your buck more more screen for your form factor with less obstruction or distraction up along top the hottest new loud smartphone this is the most tremendous camera section of a smartphone i've ever seen yeah obviously the speaker is loud it sounds great it's uh super easy to listen to will just surprised me because this video didn't have enough of the entire lineup we also have the galaxy buds pro in black and i was wondering if it did exist what if you buy the black phone of course you gotta have the black model so you might as well compare that too these are these would be the ones i would select obviously i would go for the black s21 ultra would be my choice of the bunch and you know i would slap a later case on of course you already know this so then i had to have these to match and it's the same idea you have the glossy portion which maps to the frame of the device and then you have the matte black on the other portion there i'm going to say something if you don't mind this is a very comfortable phone to hold there is an advantage to a slightly smaller phone i know everybody over here you gotta have the spec champ and whatever you're all turned on by the ultra model but willy doo is a regular s20 guy right now and he's eyeing this from across the room it's making me uncomfortable however i see where he's coming from because this is i mean i feel like i can hold that thing all day it's lighter it is uh slimmer it's slender it's still a big display it's still got a tremendous screen to body ratio and it's a very nice screen as well i don't know man it's a very nice screen as well don't know guys really nice it obviously doesn't feel quite as premium as the ultra either but it's a super comfy phone to hold this one is going to start at 7.99 and this one is going to start at 11.99 you see it's a smaller battery smaller screen lower resolution still got the snapdragon 875 in there still got a really nice display to look at you have the main camera units you don't got the funky zoom and then of course to make things a little bit more difficult when we reach for the larger version of the regular s20 this guy right here that fits right in between the two maybe that's the best combination of things the screen is almost exactly the same size as it is on the ultra variant you have the flat edge design it's a lighter weight in the hand it feels a little bit thinner as well and that one starts at 9.99 so tough choice to make i think people probably know already what they gravitate towards myself i wouldn't be satisfied not going for the ultra will he do on the other hand he likes the smaller form factor buds can't forget the buds these ones are 199 maybe i should give them a quick listen what do you say so because you're completely inside of the galaxy universe here it's super simple you just connect like this earbuds 100 battery case 83 percent battery you could see the bluetooth volume over there okay that's a actually a really secure fit it's almost like a fitness bud i feel like that thing is not going anywhere i could get up and do a song and a dance and a jog now also the noise cancelling immediately i sort of feel that if i touch and hold it will quickly toggle between those different settings oh yeah cool so there's like a rapid version of that if you need to quickly talk to people and then if i want to go back to noise cancelling boom i'm back into noise canceling and there's a little audio signal that lets you know that you've done that effectively i can actually toggle between four different settings for ambience so not just one ambient pass-through but different levels of it now this is like almost an amplification of my surroundings yeah look they got some punch to it you know i'm listening to the boom bap as well but they got some punch to it some kick to it one of the best things about these earbuds as well which i almost forgot is wireless powershare i referenced it earlier so by enabling that you're ready to charge on the back of the device and look at this little setup how clean is that little vibration red light led you know that you're charging up i mean how cool is that in a pinch all right so there you have it it is a brand new year it's a brand new samsung s series lineup s21 s21 plus and s21 ultra which now brings the s pen as well exciting times i don't know what this means for the note series especially since from a power perspective this is the real flagship right now but it's exciting for this model out of the bunch i think it's making a real case for flagship champion status of course it has a price tag to match and then of course we have some other interesting developments like the two-tone effect that they're going with we'll probably see this show up elsewhere now that samsung has done it but i kind of like that that's a nice little touch and of course we also covered the galaxy buds pro so it's been a bit of an unboxing extravaganza thank you for taking part now go ahead and let me know down in the comment section which color and model is most interesting to you and which you are most likely to go for and also remember the later case for the s21 s21 plus s21 ultra is dropping right this moment so click the link in the description if you want an ultra thin case which actually is kind of important if you're dealing with a massive phone like the ultra model as well so it's something to consider go check that out i'll have all kinds of pictures and videos and stuff with that coming up shout out to samsung thanks for this opportunity and uh there you go enjoy s21 s21 plus s21 ultra unboxed here on box therapy later [Music] you what's up guys and it's happening again we've got some massive news regarding the build quality and the displays of the whole galaxy s22 lineup and based on what's being discussed right now samsung is looking to make its galaxy s22 ultra once again the most premium exclusive flagship first step we'll be talking about the build quality of the galaxy s22 lineup according to a korean source samsung may go heavy on plastic back with both base galaxy s22 and the s22 plus while giving this premium gloss back only to its s22 ultra model this is of course one step ahead compared to what they have done with the s21 lineup right now only the base s21 is rocking a plastic bag while we see glass on both s21 plus and s21 ultra but that might change with the s22 lineup samsung is clearly trying to elevate its ultra flagship even more by giving exclusive features now as mentioned by the source this is something that is currently being discussed right now it's not finalized so things can still change now based on what we have seen with the s21 lineup and with the recent galaxy a series some people actually like this approach of using polycarbonate semi premium design there are some obvious benefits when it comes to the durability but then again a premium gloss is something you expect to see on a flagship smartphone if samsung does indeed decide to go with the polycarbonate back for its s22 plus then i expect to see a price reduction similar to what they have done with the s21 series this year now in addition to this the s22 ultra is also said to be the only model to pack the ltpo refresh rate display while both galaxy s22 and s22 plus are set to pack the standard higher refresh rate screens not just that samsung could also change its ways when it comes to the sizes so the s22 series could actually be smaller than the galaxy s22 lineup according to marq hd on twitter the s22 might pack a smaller six-inch display compared to 6.2 inch that we have seen on the s21 similarly the s22 plus is said to rock a 6.6 inch screen while the ultra model is set to rock a 6.81 inch panel now it's unclear why samsung is making this decision but in my opinion a six-inch galaxy s22 with the bezel-less design it's gonna feel even more handy than the 6.1 inch iphone 12. a solid one-hand flagship is something a lot of people will appreciate and i think it's the perfect size flagship let me know what you think about these changes also in the news this is something that i didn't cover before but it's worth mentioning samsung's one ui 3.5 is rumored to debut on galaxy z4 with a brand new split ui the new split ui is optimized to really enhance the folding form factor by really utilizing all that extra space on that display as you can see in a couple of these examples posted by ice universe you can see how we have that split in the apps you can change the aspect ratio of each side and not just that the split ui will also be adjusted according to the orientation of the device whether you're holding in portrait mode or in landscape this is actually pretty exciting samsung is also looking to not only bring the best hardware on the fault 3 but also the best software that can be for a folding device and speaking of foldables ice universe is betting heavy big success on the galaxy z flip 3 and honestly he's not wrong because there's definitely not going to be any phone like z flip 3 on the market it will be the most beautiful looking flip phone thanks to all those amazing colors it might even have an even better crease than the galaxy's evol 3 120 hertz refresh rate with slimmer bezels honestly it definitely has all the potential to become a massive success and last but not the least samsung has made a brand new memory solution official which is a flagship level solution that is coming to mid-range smartphones yes the brand new multi-chip package includes the fastest lpddr5 ram combined with the fastest ufs 3.1 storage according to samsung there's about 50 improvements when it comes to the dram speed from 17 gb all the way up to 25 gb per second while also doubling the nand flash performance so basically what this means future mid-range phones will have faster memory performance thanks to samsung's new solution that has similar memory capabilities as we see on flagship smartphones so yeah guys that is all the news what a day we have s22 lineup news regarding the build quality as well as the display let me know your thoughts regarding samsung's potential decision on using plastic on both s22 and s21 plus in case you're new here be sure to subscribe follow me on instagram and i'll see you guys later peace out Openness It’s what we believe in An open world frees us to progress Remove all limitations Defy more than gravity “Awesome” Make new connections Invite everyone in Make impossible possible The fewer boundaries we have the further we’ll go Life opens up Life opens up with Galaxy [Music] foreign [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] ladies and gentlemen please welcome to the stage president and CEO head of IT and mobile communications DJ comb [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] good morning thank you and welcome to the Samsung developer conference it's great to see oh I'm especially excited to welcome a special group of young innovators where you guys may be from why don't you stand up please look at the audience they are the winners of Samsung so for tomorrow our annual stand competition for students around the world keep them began thank you well done protego say thank you I love what they have created a virtual reality learning space for children with autism software and sensors to identify sports concussions and at base the system to fight wildfires and save lives it's all part of Samsung's commitment to helping young people learn the skills they will need to succeed in the technology driven future during the past eight years more than 640,000 students in 26 countries have participated I included youth visit the Samsung citizenship booth to see how excited young minds are making the world a better place the truth is we are all here because of our passion for using technology to improve people's lives last year at SDC I spoke about connected thinking and about Samsung's philosophy of open collaboration across an ecosystem of partners and developers so much has happened since then game-changing technologies like a 5g that are experimental are now commercially available breakthrough AI capabilities that seemed impossible are now within reach today we stand at the beginning of a new era of discovery and invention a time not just of connective thinking but of connected living a time when intelligent services connect people to the tools they need and experiences they desire a time of incredible economic opportunities build on new insights about how the world works and what customers want I say with pride the Samsung has been at the forefront of many of the advances that are the foundation for this new era and I acknowledge with gratitude how important your partnership has been in bringing us to this moment during the past year we built the world's most comprehensive open IOT platform we delivered AI innovations that are redefining connectivity and automation we pioneered 5g technologies and not launching the world's first residential 5g service many of the partners who helped make this all possible are here today so let me start this year's SDC by saying thank you thank you so much I can't tell you how excited I am by what we have achieved together but I know our work is just beginning the pieces are in place intelligence that learns and adopt 5g connectivity to make smarter cities smart homes and autonomous vehicles a reality devices secure and powerful enough to transform how interact with each other and the world will live in I will challenge our shared challenge is to use this breakthroughs to turn now int next here at SDC all take a giant step forward into a new world of experiences that flow with people as they manage their lives and move through their day which advances in our big city intelligent platform that unlock the power of AI in your products and the services now smart ins development the tools that will unleash the value of connected living for your customers a new hardware and interface concepts that will redefine the future of a mobile services all to strengthen the world's most powerful technology ecosystem as we work together to create new value for our customers and new demand for our companies to tell you more it is my pleasure to introduce my colleague yes John [Applause] so hello SDC 2018 it is fantastic to be here with you again this year I know it's hard to speak after DJ but I'll try with a little bit of your help as DJ mentioned we have a compelling vision for the future and that vision includes you Samsung's developers so here at SCC we will share how we are making our vision of a connected life a reality and what that means for you we will show you how we are creating new opportunities for our partners new opportunities to bring your ideas and your innovations to millions of customers around the world if you were here last year you heard us talk about how Bixby helped you get things done quickly with fewer tabs swipes and steps and today our vision and ambition for Bixby is much bigger we believe it is much more than a simple voice assistant and that is why we are deeply committed to AI working continuously to advance our AI vision and technology in fact at CES 2018 we promised that by 2020 all Samsung devices will be AI enabled and be connected to each other and to meet that ambitious goal we we expanded our R&D organization by adding seven AI centers in places like Cambridge and Montreal and by 2020 we plan to hire more than 1,000 AI experts and invest twenty two billion dollars Samsung's wide-ranging product portfolio from mobile devices to TVs to refrigerators at the essential building blocks for an AI enabled device ecosystem in fact we sell more than 500 million devices every year and imagine how big a difference this will make in people's lives a I will truly transform every experience we have with consumer electronics and a sensor Bixby's our singular commitment to AI we believe pixely fundamentally changes how people use technology and what they can do with technology and with the new Bigsby users don't need to know how to do something they just need to know what they want to do and Bixby will take care of the rest and it will be all around you all the time working intelligently in the background to empower you to do more and now to make this happen we have to reimagine Bixby from a simple mobile voice assistant to a scalable AI platform today we are focusing on three areas that will increase Bixby's reach and footprint first we are putting Bixby on more devices creating new user experiences new AI experiences for consumers and you will be experienced the power of Bixby on Samsung TVs refrigerators tablets and speakers and we also expect to see Bixby on more connected and third-party devices in the future and second in coming months Bixby will be expanded to support five more languages this effort will grow the addressable market for big speed and our third strategy to grow and scale Bixby and probably this is the most important one is to make it open open to your ideas your innovations and your imagination and now for the first time we are opening up Bixby to all of you developers and this thank you thank you thank you I'm really excited to myself so this means giving you a brand-new set of developer tools actually the same tools we use so you can build your own decks of experiences I think you are gonna love what you will see later in the keynote we will also be launching Bixby Marketplace on your channel to market your service to millions so please stay tuned for more details about the Bixby marketplace and other ways we will help you promote and sell your ideas these three focus areas more devices more languages and scalable AI ecosystem we lay the groundwork for Bixby to be our singular commitment to AI so today represents a new era in intelligence an era of truly open AI where billions of devices can be infused with your intelligence with intelligence basically created by you for the benefit of consumers so to summarize this is your opportunity the largest device ecosystem in the world at your fingertips ready for your best ideas what you will see today are the ways we are helping each of you to take advantage of that scale to reach millions of people around the globe and I'm so excited for what you will see and hear today and I know no one can buy an ecosystem you have to build it and build it together and we are ready and I hope you guys also ready to build it together so thank you so much for listening and let's work together thank you [Applause] what's this open it well yeah that my friend is a developer kit for the new Bigsby this is a blank canvas it's a metaphor what else is in here Oh everything all the tools we use to build the new Bigsby they're all yours you could pretty much do anything you want so it's kind of like a giant sandbox really another metaphor so big into Sandy there had to be this is a brand-new world Bigsby can power anything you create and you can connect to anything else big-city powers so you could do things like this hi Bigsby set the mood for snack time well hello there nice add this to my date night playlist Oh and share with my Pilates class right why why would you do that fix me lose the mood lighting oh do you want me to get the fridge now this is really gonna blow your mind it's a totally customizable yeah they're all named big P I like that the ecosystem is huge and it all works together oh wow Sam Moskow and so Toronto we've got AI centers around the globe working together on this so how do I don't know how do I get it do I you don't take I don't you don't you're not really a developer I'm not no you're not you're just a quirky actor playing one o the kids for them Oh take care buddy thank you yeah take care man who's next [Music] ladies and gentlemen please welcome to the stage CEO of viv labs dog kid Laos [Applause] [Music] good morning this is an exciting day as es mentioned we are for the first time going to share with you the details and how we're opening up Samsung's Intelligence Platform bixby to fully unleash your creativity and innovation how we together are going to redefine and completely new intelligent experiences that have never been possible before today new capabilities that within a few years we'll be on a billion devices used by millions of people around the world remember with the incredible breadth and reach of having Bixby in your pocket in your home and in your car over the next few years this is a completely new and largely untapped Channel ready for anything you can imagine and built now it's important to recognize something that might not be obvious to everyone the intelligent assistant market is still very nascent to put this in perspective I'll ask you back in 1998 when Google introduced his game-changing search engine how many others were already in the market does anyone remember the answer is that there were 14 other search engines in the market when Google got in the assistant intelligent assistant market is still young immature and ready for new ideas and innovation if you believe in the voice revolution the time to dive in is now developers and brands who make their presence early in this paradigm will have a staggering advantage in the long run let me say that again partners and brands that get in early are going to have a huge advantage let's explore that for a minute why you might ask just getting involved it now matters so much several reasons first of all intelligent assistants are one of the fastest arguably the fastest adopted technology products ever used by nearly 50 percent of all households less than five years after being introduced in the that's unbelievable the market is growing exponentially but second and perhaps even more importantly the younger the demographic the faster they adopt intelligent assistance to say that this technology is the now and especially the future is an understatement lastly getting your service and brand established early in this paradigm has one other huge consequence meaningful first mover advantage as intelligent assistants continue to ascend to a more prominent part of our day the consumer will do what they always do they'll find their favorites and they'll stick with them as long as these favors continued to deliver continued value they become the default like google and search amazon for shopping being the first great voice first experience in whatever area you're going after will generate a loyalty that will long pay dividends for years to come now to make this happen in a way that has an opportunity to greatly advance the role intelligent assistants play in our everyday lives we made a defining decision we built bixby from the ground up for developers for you our belief has always been that harnessing the power of your creativity will mark the beginning of raising intelligent assistants from being the basic tool that they are today to becoming an integral part of our lives a personal and ubiquitous presence in our everyday I promise you this day is coming now this is a big goal not for the faint of heart when we've been working on for over six years but now it's real it's here today and with your help we'll get started ok let's talk about how we'll get there together as we build this platform we adhere to two fundamental principles first no trade-offs this means a first-class development experience for every single third-party developer interested in building a bixby service this means you'll be using the exact same tools we use you'll have full access to every deep set of functionality we use to build bixby today and this unprecedented in fact this is the first assistant paradigm platform that makes third-party developers truly first-class citizens second maximum versatility there are nearly no limits on what you can build with Vic speak almost anything your creativity can conjure up it's possible to do our platform was designed to make building simple things simple and complex things possible this represents the democratization of AI and this democratization is opening up of AI to anybody will result in a Cambrian moment with massive expansion of new assistant capabilities that make Bixby a much more powerful and meaning part meaningful part of you day so you'd likely asking again how are we bringing these principles to life well I'm excited to announce here and now the release of the Bixby developer studio this has been a long time coming but it's the most comprehensive most powerful intelligent system toolset ever made way ahead of the other guys and it's not even close the big speed developer studio will allow you to develop the way you know how with a downloadable integrated development environment that enables you to store files wherever you want manage your own source source code versioning and also enables efficient reuse of code for the various device types and locales supporting these be also with this development tool we're introducing our new dynamic program generation this means that as a developer you don't have to anticipate and write decision trees or hardwired code for every possible use case you'll be hearing a lot more about this shortly now to show you the big speed developer studio let me introduce my co-founder and friend Adam Shire [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hello before I show you the Bixby developer studio I want to share one of the reasons I'm so excited about our announcement today for decades the relationship between the developer and the computer has been a simple one the developer tells the computer what to do hand coding every possible use case in scenario a very manual human driven process in the last 10 years with the evolution of deep learning and neural networks developers can now give examples to machines and the machine will compute the logic automatically unfortunately this is done in such a way that humans can't really understand how the machine reaches its conclusions very AI driven what we're introducing today for the first time promotes a new developer paradigm where an AI and a human developer work together collaboratively each doing what they do best developers provide the what describing objects actions and goals that make up the world they care about the AI then adds the how determining how to organize these concepts and actions into a custom program to handle users requests the result is a big savings to developers who no longer have to enumerate every situation this can also produce a better experience for end users who now have adaptable interfaces that evolve over time according to their needs and preferences we call this dynamic program generation and we haven't seen anything like this for any programming language or AI assistant on the market alright let me show this all to you right now welcome to the Bixby developer Center the first step is for developers to go to the Bixby developer website sign up and login and here's where you land from the Bixby developer Center you have access to documentation all searchable from a beautiful interface we have reference guides developer guides you can set up your teams and capsules and manage their visibility of every capsule you develop you can engage with the community and our support engineers and most importantly you can download the amazing Bixby developer studio for either Windows or Mac let me show this to you right now as a developer you extend Bixby's knowledge and capabilities by creating a capsule think of a capsule like a knowledge pack from the Matrix movies when the user enables a capsule there Bixby now knows about all of the capabilities defined for that service to demonstrate this out-of-the-world technology let's start with a space capsule that lets a user search for and make reservations at a space resort with Bixby you start by modeling the concepts and the actions for your domain and then this is where it gets a little crazy unlike existing approaches where developers have to write a lot of code to handle every use case in interaction with Bixby all of this is going to be written for you by the AI in a few milliseconds let's give this a try I'll enter a request a training example make a reservation for two people at a space resort on Mars with an oxygen bar the first we need to give a goal so I think what I really want to do is make a reservation and then I indicate the important input so Mars is a planet notice how autocomplete makes this a lot easier this will be a search criteria oxygen bar and two people is the number of astronauts I want to bring along with me on my voyage now watch instantly Bixby is going to write a program to handle everything for you what we've just seen is an AI software that wrote a program that encompasses what service what services get called how to ask the user something when to apply machine learning so that the assistant doesn't bother the user with the same questions unnecessarily I'm going to compile it and now let's run the program by bringing up a simulator of a phone now I'm going to take my family on a trip let's see I need a reservation for three people to a resort on Jupiter that has orbital ziplining my son is really into that these days and what we see is a number of results Europa's joule that sounds pretty nice let me check this out looks great good for kids orbital ziplining this is the one that I want so let's book it now during the process at any time when Bixby needs some information it can ask that either using a graphical interface which I could respond to by clicking or I can simply ask for the next request let's see this I better wait and put this into the future when this resort is actually built so maybe the weekend of Christmas 2027 should be good by then here the system is now asking me what would I want to stay in and overtime it will automatically learn when I'm traveling for two I want the honeymoon suite but with my family I'm probably gonna go with something a little cheaper only $200,000 I think here it gives a confirmation and when I confirm we have a completed transaction without ever leaving the Bixby environment this is the most frictionless way to achieve Commerce in a conversational way pretty amazing what do you think so what we've just seen is an AI and a human developer working together to build a beautiful conversational transactional experience after teaching Bixby a few more use cases you might go to you can build tests where you can actually create stories to administer tests and make sure everything is working there are many aspects of this really beautiful intelligent development environment in the next two days we have many developer sessions to teach you everything you need to know to build capsules like the one I just showed you topics will include machine learning transactions natural language and conversation how to adapt capsules to different languages and devices with today's announcement you can get a head start and be among the first to join the upcoming bixby marketplace now I've been working in the intelligent assistant space for a number of years and I'd be the first to say that even with their rapid growth and adoption until now assistants have been useful but naturally essential to people's lives or businesses they're a basic utility like this duct tape but I believe with the introduction of the Bixby developer studio and with the help of all of you out there this seemingly basic utility can finally transform into something significant something important something real that will become a new thank you developers [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] ladies and gentlemen please welcome to the stage VP engineering Samsung jae-yong jar [Music] [Music] good morning I'm happy to be back here at LCC with my fellow engineers and developers I love the energy and enthusiasm in this room and throughout the Moscone Center and I'm particularly excited today because I get to talk to you about our IOT platform smart things you know it is an incredibly exciting time to be working in IOT endless opportunities to connect in new ways to make our cities cars and our homes smarter and our lives easier of course this market is poised for massive growth to more than five hundred billion dollars by 2021 it is an incredible opportunity yet to make this world a reality we need to make ilt easier for consumers for some IOT is still too fragmented billions of devices spread across different cloud infrastructures all offering different experiences for consumers delivering the dream of the truly connected world can be easier so over the past year we've taken two important steps first we announced the smart things cloud a single platform that allows you to create better more valuable IOT experiences for consumers second we announced a single unified consumer experience the smart things app it allows people to manage and control all of their Samsung connected devices and smart things compatible devices so with a single cloud and a single app we have created or truly integrated IOT experience and the results have been tremendous today smartthings connects tens of millions of people and devices in over 200 markets around the globe and we are taking it a step further in reaching this mappings platform with new devices and new partnerships we are making the smartthings platform more open to you the developer to let you reach more consumers faster over the last year the smartthings ecosystem of Samsung and third-party devices has nearly doubled and we've continued that momentum by introducing a new class of devices and services that makes staying connected even easier and more seamless for example we partnered with bloom to launch smart things Wi-Fi on a I base mesh router with smart things hub functionality this innovative router uses AI to learn usage patterns and optimize performance in real time to deliver incredible coverage and speed across your entire home smart things Wi-Fi is part of your smart home - helping you control and manage your home automations for example when you enter your house and your phone automatically connects to smart things Wi-Fi the temperature is set to your personal preference simple intelligent new ways to make life easier we also wanted to make staying connected outside of the home easier if yes this year we gave you a glimpse into how we would improve in-car connectivity integrating the Hartmann solution and the smart things cloud and because of this effort consumers will be able to control any device while in the car where their car dashboard what's more you will be able to remotely turn on cars AC or heat or flash the headlights if you can't remember where your part all via the smartthings app on your phone the smartthings platform is no longer constrained by the boundaries of the home come experience it right here at FCC by visiting the Maserati in our car bus of course the home is still critical and we are always looking for ways to make home automation better with the smartthings eco system and as many of you have already seen the smart things experience has been expanded to large screens like the TV and family help refrigerator so you can monitor and control your connected devices and smart appliances through the smart things dashboard from your living room or kitchen check who is at the door we are a door camera or get a notification when your food is done all while you are enjoying your favorite TV show this consistent and seamless smart things experience across multiple devices takes home automation to the next level to showcase how simple smart home automation czar with smart things we made the smart things button we just a tap of the button you can trigger multiple actions at one time turn off the TV and lights and reduce the temperature before you go to sleep without having to open any apps in our global ecosystem or partners continue to push the limits of home automation and beyond take Vodafone for example their new service called rehome by Vodafone delivers a home monitoring and video system all powered by smart things this freedom service is available in key markets in Europe and in partnership with a courier power exchange we created a service that can have a huge impact on energy use this service is designed to control and manage energy consumption during peak periods when the price is the highest capex alerts us when energy demand is high and using the smart things cloud we reduce the energy usage of your connected appliances lowering your utility bills this is the power of smart things letting energy providers and consumers work together to make a positive impact on the power grid these are just a few of the many exciting ways that smart Things is delivering entirely new experiences for users even outside of their homes and to tell you more about how you can be part of this growing ecosystem I am excited to introduce my friend Magnus [Music] [Applause] thank you yeah the smart earnings momentum is truly impressive an open ecosystem that brings IOT experience beyond a home and connects people in new ways but as we mentioned the still barriers charity adoption will work to remove these barriers to make arity less fragmented and less complicated twelve developers create new IT devices and services and bring that to market faster this all starts with new api's and new enhanced developer tools see you as a developer more seamlessly can integrate all devices from sig bcoa devices to cloud connected devices or to something totally new one of these tools is our new smarting cloud connector if not used to connect your cloud connected device available to the entire smartest ecosystem all with one simple integration for device makers we are launching smart things device kit this makes onboarding devices to Wi-Fi and building secure solutions much easier with a smart device kit you don't need your own cloud infrastructure use smarting cloud with no additional usage fee I'm also excited to share that we introducing a completely redesigned and improved smart links developer workspace new tools that everything you need to get started with the cloud connector ogre stories snortings device kit it will also support smart hub connector so you can integrate your sigma cv devices into the smartest ecosystem so that now you can develop for small things with using new totally ramp developer tools but we know you need more than tools you need new ways to reach more users sportings users so we are upgrading our smarting works with smart ins program to help you bring your devices and services to market faster and once you have submitted to works with smart things you'll work directly with one of our certification expert to is your best possible user experience and verify that's optimized for a smartest ecosystem works with smart things gives consumer confidence in your device and updated program bring your smarting services to market faster so what I've just heard new devices important shapes then reach this growing open IT echo system and bring the promise or to connect the lifestyle beyond the home new tools that you build and scale your smarting solution and an updated works with smart ins program to improve the experience for users and now to give you a preview or one our latest devices please welcome back Jay on [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Thank You Magnus I want to spend a few more minutes talking about the latest addition to the Samsung ecosystem Galaxy home unveiled in August it delivers high quality audio and a seamless hands-free IOT experience it features hormones finely crafted sound technology and the ultimate way to experience music in your home with hormones unique sound steer technology you can

IOT experience soon galaxy ohm will be added to the big speed developer studio that you just saw so developers will be able to create entirely new services for Galaxy home bringing unique voice enabled experiences to consumers and redefining how we use smart speakers any idea can become part of the galaxy home galaxy home is something you have to experience firsthand I encourage you to check it out while you're at SDC and now I am excited to welcome Pedro to the stage to talk about another key piece of the Samsung eco system the Smart TV thank you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] it's great to be here with all of you as you just saw with the Galaxy home Bixby and smartthings are enriching our devices in helping us lead simpler and more connected lives today I want to talk to you about another device that is a big part of almost every home the TV as our homes have gotten smarter so have our TVs at Samsung will continue to reimagine the TV experience and what it can do for you now when we announced the first big spin able TV we gave users and improved TV experience the ability to control their TV and search content with just a part of their voice but we're not stopped in there we think big speed can do more for consumers to give them control of what they watching their favorite content so to make that vision a reality starting this December we're releasing a new voice media control API so that content partners can leverage big speed to create voice enabled TV applications this I'm excited about this this voice media control API will change the way consumers interact with their TVs and I'm really excited to tell you that Netflix Hulu HBO now and Spotify will be innovating with us in this area and will be supporting various transport controls on our Samsung Smart TVs next year and you can too so please come find us in the show floor it will be excited to tell you more about our new voice media control API next I want to tell you more about TV

please welcome to the stage senior designer of UX design g1 least hi everyone it's so nice to be here in San Francisco I'm totally excited to be here with developers who create wonderful unique experiences when I meet people and tell them what I do for a living they often ask what does a UX designer at Samsung actually do and I tell them I spend a lot of time thinking about how to make smartphone you it's better listening to customers and developers about how to create hardware and software together and improve the way we interact with our devices we are very excited to share with you what our entire team has been working on for the past year and we need you the developer community to bring this to life and make it even better over the last decade the smartphone has become incredibly powerful and a vital part of our daily lives our phones are now our cameras music players computers and even gaming consoles mobile devices has grown bigger and user behavior and patterns have evolved at the same time the user interface has become cluttered and more complex with people saying smartphones are getting harder to use which is just opposite of what we want we believe it is time for a refresh we took a step back listen to what our customers were asking for and carried out a fundamental review of how people interact with their devices today whereas previous UX design often placed emphasis on adding new features over simplifying the user experience we wish there our focus and mission we aimed to develop a comfortable intuitive UX based on how people actually used if I see today the vision of our work combines every important futures that helps use your behavior at the deepest level and it's truly an honor to show you what we've come up with here at SPC ladies and gentlemen I give you one UI [Music] [Music] I'm glad you like it because my team designed it one UI is simple and easy to use with a compelling design language the foundation of our design approach is their hardware and software must work together in perfect harmony and when you I blend this to seamlessly the rounded corner of our hardware are echoed in our software this is reflected in our our icons which have been simplified to help you easily recognize and understand what each one is we've taken a new approach to presenting both content and controls because we want the eyes to be drawn to what matters rather than visit distracted by things that don't we have enough distractions don't we now everything you need to concentrate on text images or anything else is the main element of the screen because these blocks help you to focus all the important information you need is within this floating on screen blocks which is contrasted against the blank space behind them now let me show you this three key ways we paid close attention to our cost consumers and made one UI our most user focused smartphone us first we improved the user experience by making it easier to focus on the task at hand most smartphone UX were designed to provide all the options and information at a glance but with the constant evolution of smartphone technology more and more futures were added so consumers were given far more options on screen and this place became even more closed which which can be hard when you I removes this clutter making it easy to focus on one thing at a time take the setting up for example in the past hour setting have offered all the different customizable options on the main setting view then two years ago we completely refreshed the UI reducing the number of the options from 36 to just 17 this more than half so you could easily view and navigate them with less scrolling we also grouped eleven functions together to let you see the options you want easier this design change improve the usability and carriers adopted this new design for their customers and now we are making a major leap forward with one UI the options on the setting menu has been rearranged to grip relative functions together this helps you to find what they're looking for straight away we've also regrouped the functions so the most often ones come first another example the phone app has a cleaner look with one UI now you see only the essential features related to the task you are carrying out it's a continuous and fluid experience where the necessary buttons appear when you need them and gently disappear when you don't for instance when you're dialing a number the UI changes accordingly the search bar and menu tabs disappear that's because we know the user plans to make a call the smart phone controls blend into the blank area of the screen but they're still there when you need them now they don't pull your attention away with one UI user see only what they need when they need it so they can stay focused on what matters the second way we've made one UI completely user centric is by making interaction more natural the original smartphone UX was based on devices that fit in one hand but as phones have gotten bigger you are expected to have the dexterity of a classical pianist to move your fingers from the home key at the bottom to the pop ups in the middle and menu buttons at the top it doesn't have to be this way we made a fundamental change in the user interface with one UI we have restructure the way we interact with our devices now the upper part of the screen is for viewing while the lower part of the screen is for touch interaction this means the things you do most on your phones are within the range of a thumb and follow a coherent path instead of jumping from one side of the screen to the other let's use messages as an example normally we expect the messages to show the most recent messages at the very top this means you need to extend your thumb all the way to the top if you are using one hand which means you need a really long tongue with one UI your messages begins at the center of the screen where your thumb can easily reach by examining user behavior we found people's eyes naturally follow their finger movement when they are interacting with their devices because when you eye places everything you need to see where it's easy to reach it just feels much more natural to use let's take another example the class I set my alarm daily actually many alarms to wake up and I also use the time zone alert since I have the pleasure of working with developers and designers from all over the world previously we provide multiple tips to help you move between different functions at the very top of the screen this meant to reach the buttons at the bottom you had to cover the distance from one corner to the other now we've moved the tabs to the bottom of the screen so they are easily accessible for your thumb dialogue pops which we all interact throughout the day are also displayed at the bottom of the screen for easy access let me show you what I mean when an eye when I meet my friends I take a lot of photos and share them since I use the motion photo futures on the camera the pop-up asked me whether I want to send it as an image or video in the past this pop-up appeared in the center of the screen but now with one UI the pop-up appears at the bottom of the screen so you can tap it faster by changing the layout adding more blank space you can interact with your device more naturally the third thing we've done to our 1 UI is increase feature comfort let's be honest we spent a lot of time looking at our phones checking emails texting scrolling through photos which is why it's so important that interface should be comfortable for the eyes so we paid close attention to these small details that make a word of difference last year we introduced night mode in samsung internet app as a way to offer a more comfortable reading experience when it's dark consumer told us how much they loved it and that's why we have now applied it across one UI you know what new I really set a new standard for how the device and its user experience blend together seamlessly reflecting the needs and tastes of today's consumers for instance we have tuned the color of our design to provide more visual clarity more distinctive color and contrast offer a more focused and recognizable viewing experience speaking of colors we are offering something totally unique within one UI a range of color did you exhume them match the color of hardware itself now your device seamlessly reflects your preferences and style by listening to our consumers we are providing a user experience of a whole helping users focus on the task at hand interact more naturally with the device and providing a more comfortable visual experience now while we are very proud of our 1u eyes remarkable improvement we need your feedback to continue improving so I'm happy to announce one new eyes Piratas program which will begin with us Germany and Korea in November followed by more countries in Europe and Asia your valuable feedback will be used to further fine-tune one UI before it's official release we will be releasing one UI for the Galaxy S 9s 9 plus and the note 9 starting only next year when UI represents big bold thinking with the understanding of how consumers use their devices and how their patterns of instruction have evolved we're very looking forward to you trying it and telling us what you think now to showcase the innovation behind our display technology leadership please welcome - and Jim [Music] thanks yuan it's amazing to see how much software has gone into or how much effort has gone into the software that makes up one UI but every software needs great hardware - that's because hardware works with software it brings together the senses of sight and touch connecting what you see with what you feel at Samsung our goal has always been to provide the best Hardware experience to our consumers and it all starts with display technology from the start display technology has really powered the evolution of smartphones think about how you use your smartphone today and how it's changed over the past decade maybe you're playing more games watching more video which means you're looking for high resolution screens with more lifelike colors you asked and we listened we kick-started a new wave of mobile innovation when we first introduced the AMOLED display technology to our mobile devices AMOLED is thinner lighter and yes more flexible than the LCD this led to Samson creating the first Android phone with AMOLED instead of LCD and we've kept raising the bar with a commitment to make AMOLED better and better with each new galaxy phone how much better well from the Super AMOLED screen in the first Galaxy S to the infinity display of the Galaxy S nine we've increased the screen resolution by nearly 1,000 percent and today AMOLED is without question the industry standard for mobile displays just as Amal has become the industry norm for display technology big screen has become the primary choice for consumers today so much so that has led to the creation of completely new form factors in 2011 we launched the Galaxy Note and in doing so we created a whole new category the big screen smartphone the the phablet the phone that was almost too big for your pocket I was there believe me I had one turns out though we were onto something in fact by 2020 one large screen smartphone shipments will overtake those of traditional phones but as displays increased in size so did the physical size of the device itself so we asked ourselves how can we make this screen bigger without actually increasing the size of the device itself we had to think outside the box literally we realized if we could just find a way to just curve the screen we could have more of a display while maintaining a compact design of course glass generally doesn't like to bend and AMOLED has several layers of rigid glass so we had to find a new way to make a curve there's a flexible material called polyamide that's actually ten times thinner than the typical glass we use for the backplane as a display and for the top glass display using temperatures of 800 degrees Celsius we created our own 3d thermal forming technology to make the glass flex finally we went all out on a new lamination technology that allowed us to attach the curved glass layer without any bubbles or damage the result of these three groundbreaking innovations the galaxy s6 edge the first ever dual curved smartphone display but we didn't stop there we knew we could give you even more screens if we could just shrink those bezels but how do you shrink the bezels without exposing the important components underneath like the display chipset it sends signals that control the color pixels on the screen between the main processor and the display so we've got some of the best engineers in the world and they discovered that by extending one of the polyamide layers we could just curve the display behind itself this saves space so we could further reduce the size of the bezel the result was the immersive infinity of infinity display on the galaxy s 8 plus which had an eye-popping 84% screen to body ratio so you're probably noticing a trend here yet again we set the standard for smartphone design this time with infinity display so why do we do it why do we obsess about display innovation because it matters to you our consumers and that means it matters to us so we're gonna keep going the bezels are gonna shrink even further we're gonna push the limits with our new lineup the Infinity UV and O displays these are new concepts that are just right around the corner and I can't wait to tell you more about them AMOLED edge and infinity display our breakthroughs have set the tone for the industry and not only that they've led to entirely new ways of how folks are using their smartphone we've turned the industry upside down in the past and we're about to do it again today I'm so excited about our next breakthrough the foldable display and to tell you more about it here's Justin Dennison [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank you thanks for SOT it makes me proud when I think of all the industry-leading displays we've brought to market each one was an important improvement on what's come before and this helped people all around the world experience something entirely new well today we're taking our innovation in mobile to the next level and I'm honored to share with you our vision for a new generation of smartphones ladies and gentlemen I give you the future of mobile display technology the Infinity flex display [Music] [Music] [Music] Wow today is a big milestone and I'm sure you're all wondering what it looks like in real life and how it works well wonder no more it's finally here when it's open it's a tablet offering a big-screen experience thank you it's gorgeous when closed it's a phone that fits neatly inside your pocket thank you now of course I'd get in trouble if I showed you everything today so we've disguised the elements of the design but trust me there's a device inside here and it is stunning the Infinity flex display represents an entirely new mobile platform we've always strived to bring a hue meaningful breakthroughs but despite all that progress we've been living in a world where the size of your screen can only be as large as the device itself well we've just added a new dimension to help you browse watch connect and multitask like never before the Infinity flex display is the foundation for the smartphone of tomorrow to build it we had to invent new materials throw out old assumptions and reimagine the display from the ground up and the Samsung when we say reimagine we mean actually designing something new we rethought the anatomy of a smartphone display including the underlying display components as well as the cover window which is the top layer of solid glass and you know glass is the popular choice for the cover window because it protects the rest of the display and it looks beautiful but it's inherently inflexible so we had to replace it with something that has the same benefits yet achieved something new we had to invent a new protective layer in this case an advanced composite polymer that's both flexible and tough the next challenge we faced was that until now displays have been static meaning once we combined all the component layers they never had to move now that's all changed as the Infinity flex display has been designed to be folded and unfolded repeatedly without any degradation to do this we had to find a new kind of malleable adhesive that allows us to laminate the display layers together securely while enabling them to flex well we did it making this new display flexible and durable enough to be folded hundreds of thousands of times then we hit our final and perhaps biggest challenge because for this display to be foldable we had to make it thinner than any other mobile display we've ever made in this case we have the opportunity to reduce the thickness of the polarizer which is an essential layer that filters external light reducing glare so that you can read the display and to solve this we created a new polarizer that's 45 percent thinner and we're not stopping there our innovation pipeline includes new technologies such as rollable and even stretchable displays what you're seeing today is the result of the most talented engineers and designers in the world making incredible breakthroughs to create something amazing for you and this isn't just a concept the breakthroughs we've made and display materials have been matched by breakthroughs in manufacturing as a result we'll be ready to start mass production in the coming months thank you thank you infinity flex represents the biggest leap forward in mobile display technology in the last decade and what's even more exciting is how this technology will empower our developers and consumers to do amazing things it's a blank canvas for us to create something beautiful together and the Infinity flex is more than a new kind of display and together with one UI it lays the foundation for a new platform an entirely new mobile experience one UI works through two displays when the device is closed you have all the benefits of a normal smartphone the cover display is a fully functioning touch stream that allows you to use your apps without opening the device and if you want a bigger screen you simply unfold it to reveal the full 7.3 inch display and with app continuity the app you are using when the device was closed is right there waiting for you when it's open it's an intuitive continuous experience between the cover display and the main display in addition we're giving people the ability to run up to three apps simultaneously no swapping between apps no closing one app to get to another just multitasking as it was meant to be we call it multi active window thank you you can see how one UI turns the foldable display into something of real value that's gonna reinvent the mobile experience it's what you've seen today has covered new display technologies new form factors new platforms and totally new ways of using a mobile device as developers and creators we hope that this has sparked your imagination about how we can bring about a new era of mobile technology we have the potential to drive real revolutionary change together and there are three ways we're gonna help you get started first we'll be distributing an emulator apk to help you test your apps for this new form factor second will be providing clear development guidelines so you know exactly what new features your app should support and third we're hosting a developer session this afternoon to go into more detail on both of these today is all about partnership and collaboration and our work with Google exemplifies that to tell you more about how we're working together with Google to open up the android framework and make this all possible please help me welcome our friend from Google Glen Murphy [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank you hi everyone I'm Glenn Murphy and I lead UX for Android at Google we recently celebrated androids 10th anniversary when Android began we never thought that ten years later there would be over two billion active devices and such a vibrant developing ecosystem as we see here today from those early days Samsung and Google have partnered closely Samsung has continuously pushed the limits of what is possible with mobile technology and they've introduced new concepts like phablets and the s-pen the launch of the infinity 2 display on the galaxy s 8 also brought in new types of displays with unique aspect ratios we love working with partners that push the limits because Android has always been about sorry Android has always been about evolving the platform to enable innovation and that has led to each generation of devices bringing something new to all of our users so that's why I'm super excited to talk about the next stage in our partnership together our team at Google loves the innovation in display technology shown here so we have been working super closely with Samsung on it today we are announcing that Android is officially supporting the foldable form factor and we will be building into the platform the API is to ensure a seamless foldable experience supporting new capabilities like app continuity and multi active window which will allow your application to handle multitasking in new ways as well as dealing with resolution changes as a user folds their device we're really excited to see how developers like you can help us unfold this feature going forward we will continue to work for the developer community an ecosystem partners like Samsung to continue adding foldable features to the Android platform you will see these changes rolled out in new Android releases and Samsung's foldable devices on behalf of the Android team at Google I'd like to thank you all for building such amazing apps and services for Android and I'd also like to say thank the Samsung team for their continued partnership your passion for innovation really helps make Android stronger thank you and I hope you enjoy SDC now I'd like to hand it back over to you Justin [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Thank You Glenn [Music] we've always worked hand in hand with Google to offer the ultimate Android experience on Galaxy devices and by working with Google on the Android device and the Android developer community will ensure a seamless foldable mobile experience the smartphone is changing but one thing remains the same our purpose to create technology that AHS inspires and changes people's lives we hope that we've inspired you until the next unpacked you'll see more of this technology in action thank you for being partners on this journey and we look forward to working with you to rediscover the smartphone experience all over again now please help me welcome DJ back to the stage [Applause] [Music] thank you my special thanks to Glen from Google for joining us today I'm proud of our long-term strategic relationship and the spirit of a collaboration a partnership that we have share 1ui and I will revolutionary foldable display I create examples of how we are breaking barriers and redefining mobile technology and I want to thank you all so much for joining us here at SDC 2018 overcome together at a key turning point in our industry a new generation of technology breakthroughs has opened the door to change at a pace we have never seen before and created new opportunities at our scale we have never imagined esidisi 2018 is all about seizing these opportunities from the launch of the big city developer studio with his new dynamic program generation technology to the smarting certification program and the smart in the developer workspace to 1ui and our first foldable display the potential to change people's lives has never been greater and the opportunities have never been more exciting it will take partners who share our commitment to innovation inspired by people so this is my commitment to you to foster an ecosystem of open innovation that spans every aspect of people's lives and work in partnership to help you unlock the value of you ideas for your customers today this is just a start I can't wait to see how you use old great new technologies where we share today to discover what comes next thank you for joining us today and before I cross my meant I wanna just share one thing it's a like my marriage with the philosophy number one I want the galaxy brand to be beloved by our customers number two I want to Samsung to be one of the world's most trusted companies by its employees and number three no matter whether you are a small company or a big company it doesn't matter I want a win-win relationship built on mutual trust thank you for joining us today we look forward to working with all of you to unfold an exciting new future thank you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you samsung's most craziest design can soon become a reality what's up guys we're back with the latest news imagine if the upcoming galaxy tab said ultra had a baby with the galaxy note ultra device this would be that epic result what you're looking at right now is a galaxy fold tab that can convert from a tablet display to a samsung galaxy note ultra form factor on steroids just look at those curved edges it looks very futuristic now this is the second time we're seeing a product with a dual folding design and not just that is the only foldable device that can fold outward and inward so depending on the folding stage whether you fold it outward or inward it can take a super curvy galaxy note look if you do the opposite which is folding the two sides inward it basically locks everything and it looks like this now in the previous version of the spare tent we have a separate magnet strip on the back to hold the s-pen and it kind of shows off that same look as well because of the unique form factor you can place the s-pen on the device without applying any case it's sort of similar to that huge foldable display that samsung showed off that transforms into a laptop while this transforms into a note phone i am super excited for the year 2022 samsung can transform and continue the note series in so many different ways let me know what you think about this dual folding galaxy note z tab beast also in the news we finally have a league date regarding the unpacked event where samsung will announce their 2021 foldable devices including the z-flip and the z-fold 3. according to max weinback it might happen on 3rd august 2021 which is actually not that far away in addition to foldable devices we could see the galaxy watch 4 as well as the watch for active along with the galaxy but 2 which are said to be the most affordable earbuds from samsung with active noise cancellation feature we're still not exactly sure whether we'll see the snare breaking triple eight plus soon later down the year but either way the z series will be packing a qualcomm chip once again samsung is not using their own homegrown exynos 2100 maybe next year they might change their mind and lastly the latest samsung devices to become official are two tablets samsung galaxy a7 lite and galaxy tab s7 fan edition the dab a7 lite might just be samsung's cheapest tablet of all time it's said to start at around 180 in russia for 32 gb model and that's the wi-fi only model with lte there are obviously some other variants as well as for the galaxy tab s7 fe it's going to start around 550 to 600 range for the 128 gb model it features are said to be very similar to samsung's higher end model we've got akg tuned speakers s-pen a full-on tablet samsung one ui keyboard accessories samsung decks a decent 1080p display minus the higher refresh rate and a flagship processor since no other major android manufacturer is working on a tablet at this price range the tab s7 fe might just get really good sales so that's all the latest news samsung's galaxy note z tab thingy is just absolutely extreme the only concern about this monster is durability of course samsung will improve its ultra thin glass massively by the end of 2022 that's when this thing can come out let me know your thoughts in the comments below with that being said i'll catch you guys later peace out foreign foreign um security foreign foreign foreign foreign [Music] you [Music] hmm [Music] how to restore deleted images in gallery from the recycle bin on your Samsung Galaxy S 9 OS 9 plus now first go back to your home screen and launch the gallery app in the gallery app tap on a menu key and tap on recycle bin now any images that you didn't delete it will go see the recycle bin here so tap on the edit button and then select an image that you want to restore then turn on the restore button and thousand images is now in store so you can go back to your gallery and try to locate the photos from for the gallery right there and that's it so let's say if I delete this one here and turn on delete move to recycle bin I can go to the recycle bin and then we stole an image so you can tap on this button here and it is new restore and that's it tapping on the HOME key to finish thank you for watching this video please subscribe to my channel for more videos Hello and welcome to a very special Unpacked! Over the last decade, we at Samsung have pioneered countless exciting mobile experiences. New hardware, new software, new ways to stay connected and give you the freedom to live your life to the fullest. With all of our mobile innovations, and so many more industry-leading technologies, we have reinvented yet another category: the personal computer! Today, I’m so proud to introduce you to the next evolution of the PC: the new line of Galaxy Books. True mobile computing for the connected world! When we set out to reimagine a new mobile computing experience, we asked ourselves a single question: Why can’t laptops be more like smartphones? The answer was right in front of us. Mobility, connectivity, continuity. Performance on the go, ultra-vivid displays and seamless integration with your devices. Everything that has always been at the core of the Galaxy experience. And now, we’ve brought all of that to the PC: the latest addition to the incredible Galaxy ecosystem. The Galaxy Books are ultra-light – and ultra-mighty. As thin as a smartphone, but as powerful as a PC. They have boundless connectivity, so that you always have the freedom to set your own hours, wherever you go. And they are a window into your Galaxy – perfectly designed for seamless use across all of your favorite devices. And, for the very first time, flawless integration across Android and Windows. The result of open collaboration with long-standing partners to provide the best connected experience. You’ll hear more about the collaboration behind the new Galaxy Books in a few minutes. But first, here’s Stephanie, to tell you more about all the ways that the Galaxy brand is changing the world. Thanks, TM. So let’s talk about the Samsung Galaxy approach to meaningful innovation – And how we can help enrich people’s lives through technology… and empower them to create a more open and collaborative world. Meaningful innovation means we have to overcome the barriers that stand in the way of people’s passions... progress... and pursuit of a better future... We need to innovate for a world that’s open in every way, so people could be the best versions of themselves. A world where they don’t have to compromise who they are or what they believe in to achieve their dreams. And they expect a mobile experience that matches up. They want technology that translates vision into reality. And this has always been the spirit of Samsung Galaxy. When we wanted to give people more freedom to express themselves, we designed the S Pen and the Galaxy Note. And to offer new levels of versatility... we revolutionized the smartphone category with the Galaxy Fold. But Galaxy is more than just game changing technology — it’s about empowering experiences without limitations. We believe in giving people the flexibility to connect with devices, platforms, and brands on their own terms. Now we’re bringing our open-world mindset and the latest innovation to a category that’s ready for a bold new chapter: personal computers. With so many people working and learning remotely... PCs have taken on a bigger role in our lives — yet we’re still using technology designed for the old rules of work and play. So... as TM just mentioned, we found ourselves wondering… ‘why can’t laptops be more like smartphones?’ After all, smartphones are ready for anything. They pack high-end performance in a design that’s thin, lightweight and totally portable. You can connect to the internet, with or without WiFi, 24/7. Share photos and files in an instant. All with a full-day battery that can keep up with your life. We’re bringing what people love most about their smartphones to a conventional laptop experience... so you can communicate, collaborate, and innovate, wherever you are. Because when we eliminate the barriers that stand in our way, we discover new paths and possibilities. Life opens up with Galaxy. Back to you TM Thank you, Stephanie. At Samsung, we have always believed that the best innovations only happen with teamwork. In order to innovate, you have to collaborate. Nowhere is that more true than with our new mobile computing experience – the result of an amazing collaboration between Samsung, Intel, and Microsoft. I’d like to welcome to the stage my good friend, Gregory Bryant, at Intel. And joining us remotely, Panos Panay, from our close partner, Microsoft. For over fifty years, Intel has pushed the limits of silicon. They’ve done it again with the Galaxy Book, the first computer to combine the mobility and freedom of a smartphone with the power and performance of a PC. And when it comes to productivity with continuity, Microsoft is the best in the business. Whether working remotely or enhancing your productivity between PC and mobile, Microsoft knew just what the Galaxy Books needed.

The results speak for themselves. They combine stylish mobility, boundless connectivity, and seamless continuity. The next amazing chapter in the story of the PC. This is mobile computing powered by Samsung Galaxy! Let’s meet the all-new Galaxy Book Pro and Galaxy Book Pro 360! Introducing the all-new Galaxy Book Pro and Galaxy Book Pro 360. For the first time ever, we’re bringing the smartphone experience straight to your PC. Galaxy Book Pro comes in a clamshell design. At just 11.2 mm and 868 grams, the 13.3-inch Galaxy Book Pro is the thinnest and lightest Galaxy Book ever. Meanwhile, the 2-in-1 convertible Galaxy Book Pro 360 is more than a PC — it’s a creative canvas you can take anywhere. It’s as thin as your smartphone, and weighs about one kilogram. Using our expertise from designing Galaxy foldable smartphones, we created the thinnest hinge possible for a convertible PC, giving you a smooth and seamless experience. Both models are available in two sizes: 13.3-inch and 15.6-inch. Each model comes with its own set of three gorgeous colors. The Galaxy Book Pro has a striking two-tone color, while the Galaxy Book Pro 360 sports a full metallic look. Our team crafted every part of this PC to break new ground in computer design. Let’s take a closer look. We built the Galaxy Book Pro series with the durability and lightness you expect from your smartphone. Presenting our newest additions to the Galaxy lineup: the GALAXY BOOK PRO 360 and GALAXY BOOK PRO - PCs infused with our Galaxy DNA. With 360-degree turns, the GALAXY BOOK PRO 360 is built for conventional — and unconventional — uses. A PC this flexible needs to be able to handle everything you do, from every angle… so we made this Galaxy Book incredibly durable. To keep it light without compromising that durability, we chose 6000 series aluminum as our main ingredient, and reimagined our manufacturing process — finding the golden ratio of thickness, weight, and stiffness. To craft the upper portion, we extruded the metal to 2.8 millimeter. With relentless research and experimentation, we discovered the optimal structure. Then, we used the CNC method to slim parts of the upper portion down to 0.5 millimeter - while maintaining impressive durability. When crafting the front portion, we combined the standard CNC and press method. So, the front portion is now slimmer - half of its original thickness. We then polished, sand-blasted, and anodized. The result? GALAXY BOOK PRO 360’s stunning, durable finish… And for the GALAXY BOOK PRO, we took portability to new heights. We set out to build a super lightweight PC, with the mobility of a smartphone. For this model, we reduced the overall weight We meticulously crafted our ultra-slim bezel by using the Silk Printing method. And for a glossy texture, we incorporated Nano Imprinting Lithography, a technique used to fabricate semiconductors. This allowed us to create a 15- and 13-inch bezel from the same sheet, optimizing efficiency and reducing waste. So Galaxy Book Pro is sustainable —on top of its lightness and mobility. With the GALAXY BOOK PRO 360 and GALAXY BOOK PRO, we’ve redefined and reimagined laptops. So you can harness more mobility, more possibilities and more freedom… all on your PC. As you can see, we were inspired by our smartphones while designing the Galaxy Book series. And we made sure to include some of the best smartphone tech as well — starting with the display. Galaxy Book Pro comes with industry-leading AMOLED displays. They’re 30 times more responsive and 200 times more vivid than LCD screens, with 35 percent more accurate colors. These screens are also equipped with Eye Care Display, which helps reduce eye strain by cutting harmful blue light to less than 6.5 percent. We also built Galaxy Book Pro with full port support, so you can easily connect to other devices. You want to kick your productivity up a notch, you can link up to three external monitors. And, with Thunderbolt4 supports, you can connect to many peripherals, including a display at 8K. And for customers who want our most advanced display technology, Galaxy Book Pro 360’s Super AMOLED display goes above and beyond. We brought the signature touch screen experience from our smartphones and tablets, so you can control the screen like you would a tablet… and use an S Pen with it, too. The S Pen comes right in the box, and it’s the size of a real pen, with a comfortable grip. You can draw, speak and record easily, using our S Pen and Screen Recorder. And with Studio Plus, you can edit and share your recorded content. And you can do it all without a separate mic, camera, or editing program. The S Pen is the perfect companion for taking your productivity – and creativity – to the next level. The AMOLED screens on Galaxy Book Pro and Galaxy Book Pro 360 both give you amazing visual experiences. And with Live Wallpaper that changes to match the time of day, you can enjoy our displays in all their vibrant colors. But these models don’t just deliver great visuals. They also deliver amazing sound quality. Thanks to Dolby Atmos audio technology, a next-generation surround-sound system, you can immerse yourself in your favorite shows and movies. We’ve all been spending more time on our PCs over the past year. So we wanted to optimize the Galaxy Book Pro series to make every experience more comfortable. We started by studying how people use their keyboards. We looked at the way our fingers exert pressure and the elasticity of the keys, to determine an optimal travel distance of 1 mm. This, along with a refined scissor mechanism, allowed us to build a smooth and springy keyboard, while keeping the Galaxy Book Pro series thin. The result? Our best-ever typing experience with the quieter, softer, and more responsive Pro Keyboard. While designing the Pro Keyboard, we slimmed down its plate and gave it a slight upward positioning. This created space for a bigger, more enhanced touchpad. This new touchpad and keyboard will optimize your scrolling and typing. But we know that these days, we all spend a lot of time on video calls. These PCs come with dual array mics placed on either side of the camera, to better capture and amplify your voice. And Intelligent Noise Cancelling detects and removes background noise. So even if your dog is barking or there’s construction nearby, your calls will have fewer interruptions. As you can see, we’re bringing the best of mobility from our Galaxy smartphones and tablets straight to your PC. Of course, this requires both power and connectivity… and the Galaxy Book Pro series is no exception. To tell you more about it, here’s Hassan. Our Galaxy smartphones are like extensions of ourselves. We use them for everything — and that’s why they’re packed with incredible capabilities from top to bottom, and from inside out. But what makes our smartphones really special is their secure, dedicated connectivity. Today, I’m excited to announce that we’re bringing this connectivity to the Galaxy Book Pro series. We launched the world’s first-ever commercial 5G smartphone two years ago. And now, we’re bringing 5G to the Galaxy Book Pro 360. With this level of connectivity, you’re no longer limited to areas with Wi-Fi to download, or to stream video. You can get online wherever you are — even when you’re out in the park. And keeping your devices connected takes a serious, high-performance chipset. So we partnered with Intel to deliver a powerful performance on the Galaxy Book Pro series. To hear more about this incredible partnership, let’s welcome back GB. Today, with the launch of the Galaxy Book Pro and Pro 360, Samsung and Intel marked a new era in our partnership. Built on the Intel Evo platform, the new Galaxy Book designs have been co-engineered and verified for an exceptional mobile experience - including incredible performance, long battery life and instant wake. To further deliver on the promise of uncompromised mobility, we had to engineer something that had the thinness and responsiveness of a smartphone, coupled with the performance of a PC. We did this by optimizing PC experiences that are tuned from the inside out. We shrunk the motherboard, we improved battery life, and we delivered the most efficient thermals to deliver the highest performance on the go. We also enabled an integrated, full-touch display. And, finally, for better virtual collaboration, we built an AI engine to make video conferencing with longer battery life and advanced features like background noise removal and background blur. Each of these innovations were critical in creating a beautiful PC that offers maximum versatility in the world’s thinnest Evo design. And that brings me to the two final elements needed to deliver great mobility: blazing fast connection to the cloud and powerful performance. The Galaxy Book line up is equipped to deliver three industry leading connectivity solutions: WiFi-6E, 5G and custom Bluetooth enablement. Together, these technologies unlock anytime, anywhere access across all Samsung devices – at gigabit+ speeds. And then last but not least, at the heart of the Galaxy Book is the 11th Gen Intel Core processor with Intel Iris Xe Graphics. It’s the world’s BEST processor for thin-and-light laptops, delivering real-world performance and capabilities for productivity, collaboration, content creation, gaming and entertainment. As you can see, every technology found in the Galaxy Book was integrated to keep people in the flow and focused on the things that matter most to them. And they were all made possible by Samsung and Intel’s commitment to driving innovation forward and delivering a new standard for computing. Thanks, GB! Our work with Intel has led to a lineup of next-generation PCs that deliver incredible performance with powerful processors. To ensure the heat is removed from the CPU and well dissipated into the air, we started by redesigning the heat sink — the mechanism that keeps your PC cool. As bar-raisers in the smartphone category, we applied our learnings to push the envelope, reducing the size of the heat pipe to a remarkable 1 mm. We also paid close attention to the fan’s design to optimize airflow. We fit up to 73 blades, boosted the impeller’s diameter up to 50 mm, and gave the radial blade a new forward curve. So, when you’re playing an intense game, creating and editing content… or doing heavy tasks on multiple monitors… our enhanced cooling system helps sustain high performance. Our mobile-first mindset helped us redesign the battery, too. We redesigned the battery cell by optimizing its platform, which led to the creation of this super-slim battery… all while reaching a higher energy density. Simply put, we fit more power into less space. The Galaxy Book Pro series can deliver up to 20 hours of video playback, or up to 16 hours of standard usage for work and play. the Pro series can be charged for up to 8 hours of use in just 30 minutes! We relied on our mobile expertise to make bold changes to the hardware, from the chipset to the battery. Let’s hear more about these fundamental changes and innovations that went into these amazing products. Designing new products is much like designing a new city. The product I have here is precisely that. It all began with a simple question: “Why can’t laptops be more like smartphones?” By using mobile parts, we could reduce the size of hardware and increase the level of integration. And that gave us a powerful Galaxy Book that’s slimmer and lighter than ever before. Galaxy Book’s most fundamental component is the PCB. Its role can be compared to a city’s infrastructure like a road network. Mobile parts including 5G hardware were added, so more than 23,000 parts had to be installed in Galaxy Book. We needed to rethink the PCB configuration called Artwork. By optimizing the distance between the CPU and memory, we created the beautiful piece of equipment you see here. We needed Galaxy craftsmanship at its finest. Next, we turned to the battery. Like a city’s powerhouse, it’s a cornerstone that defines the user experience. With our Galaxy expertise, we increased the energy density of the battery pack and reinforced it with an extra safety feature. We also added a longevity algorithm to extend the time you can use your Galaxy Book. Finally, we tested out battery and found it met rigorous standards for capacity and durability. We’re here to present a winning combination of innovation and craftsmanship. Meet the new Galaxy Book. At Samsung, we’re committed to innovation at every level: building better tech, improving your life, and paving the way for a healthier planet. This year, we took a leap forward to deliver a more sustainable Galaxy Book experience. It starts with our super-fast, 65W charger. We used Gallium nitride, a wide bandgap semiconductor that can handle higher voltage more efficiently than standard materials. With this change, we were able to reduce the size of the charger, along with the materials required overall. We also built this charger with recycled materials. The Galaxy Book Pro and its charger together weigh only about 1kg! This charger comes with a detachable USB-C cable, so you can use this one, super-fast charger for your Galaxy devices. That’s easier for you — and it’s better for the environment, too. We also slimmed down the packaging size of our new PCs by up to 39 percent, thanks to our thin-and-light product designs. That means we’re creating less raw material waste and conserving energy. To top it all off, we even made the outer and interior materials with recyclable paper. Samsung continues to expand our commitment to an eco-friendly experience. Thanks to our mobile DNA. The Galaxy Book Pro is the world’s thinnest in its class, with a stunning AMOLED display and LTE connectivity. And Galaxy Book Pro 360 delivers a gorgeous Super AMOLED display and 5G connectivity, all in a flexible 2-in-1 form factor. We’re kicking off a new era for PCs, delivering the mobility, connectivity, and continuity you deserve. And this is just the beginning of our exciting lineup. Introducing the Galaxy Book. As you’ve just seen, the Galaxy Book is designed to make Samsung innovation accessible to everyone: students, teachers… creators and artists… anyone who wants the tools to bring their best ideas to life. It comes with a 15.6-inch display, a slim bezel, and a body that opens to a full 180 degrees. It’s available in Mystic Blue or Mystic Silver. And this PC delivers both portability and power. The 11th-Gen Intel Core processor with Iris Xe Graphics — the same chipset on the Galaxy Book Pro series — is also available on Galaxy Book, delivering powerful performance while focusing on the essentials. We know an important part of the mobile computing experience is the ability to stay online and connected. That’s why we’re bringing LTE connectivity to your Galaxy Book. Personally, over the past year, I spent more time online than ever before. Whether I was catching up with friends or family, I made a lot of video calls, and I’m sure you did, too. With Studio Mode, you can customize the way you look onscreen. You can add lighting effects, and use filters to tweak your appearance. And when you’re in the middle of a video chat, you can easily — and quickly — turn off your camera and mic… thanks to our dedicated function-key. Just like the Pro series, Galaxy Book comes with Dolby Atmos audio technology — so you’ll get incredible sound while watching a new movie or show. And with its long-lasting battery, you can indulge in your favorite activities. It also comes packed with many useful ports — including a microSD port. And that’s just one more way your Galaxy Book will meet your everyday, essential needs. And of course, we can’t forget about gamers. For you guys, we bring you the Galaxy Book Odyssey. Galaxy Book Odyssey comes in Mystic Black with a unique cover logo, for a striking, standout look. With NVIDIA RTX 3050Ti GPU, we deliver a smooth gaming experience, even in this thin-and-light design. And with its powerful Tiger Lake-H chipset, this PC performs under pressure - giving you optimal performance. It’s ready to deliver high-quality gameplay from the very best of Xbox Game Pass.

Galaxy Book Odyssey has an even more powerful chipset and a unique design — it’s a perfect match for gamers about to embark on their wildest adventures. Both Galaxy Books deliver the power and portability you need, with the essentials to take your favorite activities to all-new heights. Our Galaxy Books are now part of our wider Galaxy experience. They work harmoniously with our devices to add more flexibility and convenience to your everyday life. To tell you more, here’s Patrick. The entire Galaxy Innovation story is shaped by the pursuit of a better, more complete Galaxy experience, taking each generation a step further. When designing the Galaxy Book series, our most important goal… beyond creating the most powerful laptop… was to extend the expected user experience of Galaxy devices. Our Galaxy innovators extracted the DNA that makes a Galaxy device. With these insights, we took the traditional laptop and transformed it into an entirely new computing experience. It’s the answer to a question, “why can’t laptops be more like smartphones?” We took what’s most useful from the mobile experience and brought it to the Galaxy Book. We had a special focus on delivering continuity (through) device connection, expansion, and sharing. When setting up a new PC, transferring files you’ve accumulated over the years is painful. That’s why we added Galaxy Book Smart Switch. Just like Smart Switch on a Galaxy smartphone, it does all the heavy lifting for you. It moves all sorts of data – files, settings, apps. This time, from a Windows PC to your new Galaxy Book. We continued to deeply collaborate with Microsoft to lead a seamless “Galaxy to PC” experience. Enjoy your mobile apps on your Galaxy Book, thanks to the “Link to Windows” integration. You’ll see for yourself how unified it looks. And with easy apps syncing, even across different operating systems, your productivity will be enriched. For the first time, SmartThings is integrated into a PC, again making the Galaxy Book unique. You can tie and connect all your SmartThings devices on this PC. With the addition of Galaxy Book series, we redefined the possibilities our Galaxy family can bring, from smartphones, to the Tab, Watch, Buds… and now, the Galaxy Book. We are truly excited to invite you to an enriched Galaxy experience. Over the years, Samsung Galaxy has delivered meaningful mobile experiences. And now, we’re bringing those same experiences to the PC. We want you to have a seamless journey, from the moment you take your Galaxy Book out of the box and turn it on. Transferring your data to a new phone is simple — especially on Samsung’s smartphones and tablets, where Smart Switch makes it easy to transfer your data and device settings. To date, our customers have made over 355 million data transfers with Smart Switch. Moving data to a new PC, however, has always been more complicated. You have to transfer all your files to an external hard drive, then copy it over to your new computer. Not anymore. Today, we’re bringing Galaxy Book Smart Switch to our Galaxy Book series, so you can easily switch over from any Windows PC to your new Galaxy Book. Once you’ve set up your Galaxy Book, you’ll enjoy a more continuous experience across all your Galaxy devices. With Easy Bluetooth Connection, pairing your Galaxy Buds with your Galaxy Book is a hassle-free experience. It’s a short and simple process, with an intuitive, pop-up UI that will be familiar to Galaxy smartphone users. At Samsung, we make technologies that work great together. On any given day, I constantly go back and fort between my smartphone and my PC — and we know that you do, too. That’s why we made sure the Galaxy Book series delivers a continuous phone-to-PC experience. When you first boot up your Galaxy Book, you’ll be greeted by some of your favorite apps — like Samsung Notes, and Samsung Gallery. I use Samsung Notes on my smartphone all the time — and now, those Notes will sync to my Galaxy Book in seconds. >From ideas that jump to mind... to notes from your calls… simply access what you write down in Samsung Notes, and continue your train of thought on any of your Galaxy devices. We’ve made similar changes to Samsung Gallery, so you can pull up your photos and videos from your Galaxy smartphone right on your Galaxy Book. You can even edit and apply filters, just like you would on your smartphone. The new Galaxy Book series enhances the Galaxy experience — and we’ve been working with Microsoft to take it even further. To tell you more about our collaboration in bringing a seamless Phone-to-PC experience to life, let’s welcome the Head of Cross Device Experiences from Microsoft. Hey Shilpa! Thank you, Stanley. For the past two years, Microsoft and Samsung have partnered to create a unified experience across Windows PCs and Samsung smartphones. With the new Galaxy Book, you can expect the exact same level of continuity between your devices - a unified and effortless experience. >From your Windows PC - you can use the Your Phone App and Link to Windows to seamlessly send and receive texts, make and answer phone calls, and access all of your photos taken on your phone in full resolution. And if you own a Galaxy smartphone, you can effortlessly run your favorite phone apps from social to communication, side by side directly on your Galaxy Book. It has never been easier to interact with phone apps with your mouse, your keyboard, touch and ink. For me personally, the Your Phone app has been life changing during our remote everything life this last year. Just last week, I was in the middle of a Teams meeting on my Windows PC and I was able to easily text my husband about our child’s remote school schedule without needing to switch devices. Now, the Galaxy Book can do this for you as well! I also have my social and communication phone apps pinned to my Windows taskbar, allowing me one click access to my friends & family. And when it comes to phone calls, I can easily pick those up right from my Galaxy Book as well. With Your Phone app, your Windows clipboard and Phone clipboard stay in sync, and this makes copy-paste a breeze across all your Galaxy devices. And, to take your productivity up a notch, we’ve integrated the most popular Samsung Galaxy apps with our productivity Microsoft 365 apps: The Samsung Reminder app on your phone syncs perfectly with Microsoft To Do. Now, you can enjoy that same connected experience when it comes to your beautiful photos taken with your advanced camera on your Galaxy phone. With OneDrive natively integrated with Samsung Gallery, you can keep your memories safe and relive your memories as Motion Photos wherever you might be. And lastly, later this year, Samsung Notes will sync across your Galaxy smartphone and your Windows PC. You will also be able to search for and access all your Samsung Notes inside Microsoft OneNote, Outlook, Word, Excel, and even PowerPoint… making it an amazing, continuous experience, designed to help you do more. I am incredibly proud of the experiences our Samsung and Microsoft teams have created together, and I hope you will enjoy them as well on your brand new Galaxy Book. Thanks, Shilpa! It’s great to hear about the amazing innovations Microsoft and Samsung have achieved together. The Galaxy experience is all about making your lives better, and delivering the very best technology we can offer. Most of us use our PCs to get work done — so we built a whole ecosystem around the Galaxy Book series to help you be as productive as possible. A lot of us need more than one display to develop our creativity. With Second screen you can use your Galaxy Tab to duplicate or extend your PC’s display. You can open up a design on your Galaxy Book Pro, and sketch on your Galaxy Tab using the S Pen. You’ll get to enjoy the best of both devices… But as we all know, we tend to get more done when we collaborate. Easy sharing of our thoughts and creative sketches is important, and that’s why, we’re bringing Quick Share to our Galaxy Books. Quick Share makes the sharing process easy and painless. With a simple right-click or a drag-and-drop, Quick Share lets you share individual files — or even a whole folder at once — right from your Galaxy Book to another Galaxy device. It’s also important to know where our files are stored. Quick Search is our solution to help you quickly find your files. You don’t even need to know the file name! Just enter a keyword, and Quick Search will do the rest. It can search the text within a file, and even text that’s embedded in images, to pull up exactly what you’re looking for — faster than the native search tool. And because we know PC users need to find and share files often, we pinned Quick Share and Quick Search to the Windows taskbar for easy access. At Samsung, we create experiences that are seamless, continuous, and mobile. Experiences you can enjoy across all your devices, thanks to our incredible network of interconnected tech — the Galaxy Ecosystem. We’re bringing the benefits of SmartThings to the Galaxy Book series by expanding the boundaries of what’s possible — starting with SmartThings Find. The new Galaxy Books’ built-in Bluetooth module enables a revolutionary “offline finding” function. So if you lose your Galaxy Book, a nearby Galaxy Find node will transmit its location to your SmartThings app. We are proud to announce that to date, 68 million people have joined our Galaxy Find Network — a global community that helps people find their lost items. SmartThings is all about helping your devices work together. The new Galaxy Book series will include SmartThings Dashboard. Previously, SmartThings Dashboard was only accessible from Galaxy smartphones and tablets. But now, easily access your connected devices from your Galaxy Book — even while in the middle of your creative works. With a single click of my customized morning routine, the robot vacuum will clean, and my washer will run, while I’m getting ready in the morning. And of course, you can quickly access your most-used devices on “Favorites,” or use Bixby voice control for convenience. We envision a future where our Galaxy Books become the perfect IoT Hub. As we continue to build on this experience, we look forward to seeing SmartThings complement your life, and make your everyday more convenient. The Galaxy Book series radically changes what consumers can expect from their PCs. It delivers a mobile PC experience and phone-to-PC continuity... the tools to enhance your productivity, and a connected ecosystem powered by SmartThings. And it’s all waiting for you. Back to you, Charlie. As you can see, the Galaxy Book series delivers a seamless mobile computing experience within our ecosystem.

answer is we got both man the correct answer is always both you always have room for more waifus that's the beauty of fictional characters you can have as many as you want when aaron insurance sees samsung girl finally a worthy opponent our battle will be legendary now i don't know about you guys knowing the lore behind an actual official insurance spying sexy pink haired girl but she got so much rule 34 of her that unfortunately the company decided to axe her get rid of her entirely because there was just too much off brand of her and that's likely going to be the same fate shared with samantha and that hurts it hurts a lot why can't we just have hot fictional characters be mascots man at least wendy's is owning up to the challenge just because people looted smug wendy's they never back down this is why we stan wendy's their burgers are still amazing okay apple being like we have privacy and samsung being like we have waifu [Laughter] dear lord it's too powerful i mean when you're getting someone like me to advertise your mascot for free on youtube your brand me pulling up my phone that is powerful i wouldn't understand why you wouldn't use sled power to your advantage weebs embraced this here you have getting weebs on your side is a very powerful force again just look at how much wendy's shot up because of smug wendy i cannot hold it in anymore i just wanna you know [Laughter] trust me man i would be waking up to her beautiful alarms every morning imagine asmr freaking samantha in your ear waking you up oh god that is a free freaking idea just for you samsung what you gotta get on that is free money people would pay top dollar just for that man i should be hired dude i'm just i'm giving out all sorts of good ideas man all right there we go and there she is oh oh my it's me yep that's you oh and then tighten up being like yeah boys oh yeah let's go oh yeah oh and there we go what's going on all the posts oh rule 34 let's go it didn't take long it really didn't take long over it's probably going to be over 10 000 people on that subreddit of not safe for work easily by the time this video is uploaded i don't even know what to say am i disappointed no in fact i encouraged this behavior go at it my friends do what you would meant to do even some of my artist friends are already drawing i don't know what else to say they're already on it so you know sammy she kind of looks like um a little shapiro woman and i another image of her and yo that shapiro i mean looking pretty good the thing that really surprises me is just seconds like seconds after she starts getting trending and everything's going on there there's already cosplayers of her such as this jupiter bunny gal and um well you know what can i say what can i say just well freaking dud you guys know i like my cosplayers and i like supporting all my homie cosplayers and artists out there you know good on you you doing what you do best out there you continue to not only take these beloved characters you loot them and make them even more popular good job look at this she's already disappointed and she's picking up the phone and it's like you guys already did this you already did this now imagine if the app's like wait a minute are you looking up loots of me already master oh oh she called you master oh oh i'm just giving you free money at this point samsung like yo this is literally free money holy crap you gotta get on this i mean clearly you're an iphone user as she looks odd with superiority you don't have an air fryer and you own an apple device so pathetic so very pathetic hey man i'm all for any meme that will get people away from the scam of apple products that easily break and are very expensive for what you get like we gotta move away from that okay man we gotta get a competitive market out here that brings prices down and doesn't make just trash for people to consume over and over again so here's light farm with the post sam samsung's virtual assistant decided to update the visual and we gave her a little help and there she all is lots of posts of her being absolutely adorable and rule 34 artist being allow us to introduce ourselves ah i see you have a wonderful designed character well well well then honestly i wonder if they're flattered about this idea or if they're worried that this is actually going to ruin the chances of anything ever happening i don't think they expected it to be as viral as they did i think it's good free advertisement for life form regardless and i wish them very well in their endeavors and you know i i hope that you know samsung does adopt her because she is a very well designed with good ass sets this is this is the start of a lewd comic right here okay this is just the start and i'm just i don't know how you can assist me here a woman but i you're assisting a lot of people when there's art this high class already out there i'm just i'm just impressed i'm honestly just impressed at the internet and their ability to adopt a new woman and make her absolutely viral now i'm just curious to what you guys think about this do you think there's gonna be like another bowser that should go blow up go people gonna go crazy i i don't know i'm pretty sure there's gonna be lots of comics and this this trend is not gonna die at least for another maybe week please leave your thoughts and opinions below tell me if you want samsung devices now and um yeah i'll just see your beautiful sons and guns again next time i'll keep you up to date subscribe you know if there's any

galaxy smart tag that is hooked to my keys over here and then all i'm gonna do is i'm gonna press this button and once i press that button i'm gonna get a pop-up right here and then i can click add now to connect the tag to my phone so i can track my keys if i ever lose them and the samsung lc smart tag also has a secret built-in feature that extends its functionality beyond the tracker that does make it better than the air tag quick example i can use the air attack to control other devices in my home i can turn on and off lights we'll talk about this so let's dive in and discover what's happening hey guys soccer from saket tech and in today's video we are going to be talking about the samsung galaxy smart tags so as you know apple just released their air tags which are quite popular but we also have the samsung galaxy smart tags right here that does the exact same thing which is the fact that it allows you to track items if you attach the smart tag to for example your keys your car keys you can attach this to your car keys and then you can connect the smart tag to your phone and using your phone you can track the keys via the smart tag now the apple air tags are 29 apiece and so are the samsung galaxy smart tags right here now this one actually can be purchased right now on sale for 23. i'll drop the links to that down below but i do want to quickly mention one thing with the apple air tag when you buy one of those guys what you also have to do is you have to buy an additional loop which is going to cost you another 30 dollars that loop is going to enable you to attach the air tag to your keys your luggage whatever now the good thing is with the samsung galaxy smart tag you pay 23 for this one uh the sale price right now and what you can do is you already have a little hole here that you can easily use to attach to a key so i already attached it as an example so we already have a hole there so the key just went in there i didn't have to buy a separate loop just so it can get charged 30 dollars more but anyway in this video i want to do is i'm going to set this up real quick i'm going to show you exactly how it works now i do want to let you know this thing does have a range of 120 meters right now it uses bluetooth 5.0 technology and it does use a cr2032 battery and has a battery life of 300 days this is the galaxy smart tag i do want to let you know samsung is about to release a samsung galaxy smart tech plus as well that's going to be slightly more expensive but it's going to have higher accuracy even beyond this but anyway let's dive into this one that's a smart tag so now to connect the smart tag to the phone all you do is you press this button you're going to hear a beeping noise and within a few seconds you're going to see this pop-up right here that wants you to connect the tag to the phone so all you do is click add now now when you do this for the very first time it's going to get a couple things ready it's going to ask you to accept the terms so i'm going to say use of locate location information i'm going to agree without this it cannot track the key you need to have location information uh agreed right here so once you do that it says let's get started with your smart tag i'm gonna tap on start okay so connecting to your smart tag the phone is connecting to this guy right here press the button in the center it's saying i'm gonna do that right now okay so it says almost there your smart tag is being registered to your samsung account and then you get the success message when everything is done and you quickly give your device this device right here a name a unique name so right now i'm going to say car let's just go like this car key keys all right and i'm going to say done all right so once you do that it's going to continue the setup process now it's going to launch the smart things application this is the application that manages everything so i'm gonna tap on next over here okay it says ring your tag to help you find it so you can use the phone press a button and that rings the tag so if these keys are lost you can use your phone to track the lost keys or lost luggage or lost whatever so let's tap on start see what happens all right now i am in the smart things application here's my car keys it says what is this tag attached to i'm going to tap on select okay i'm just gonna say uh key let me just move that key right here okay so status is nearby category is key uh we have i can also by the way use these buttons right here if i press a button i can have the tag do specific actions which is crazy i'm going to come back to that in a minute but look over here it says volume so i'm going to keep the volume for the smart tag at high when i tap on play this thing is beeping and that's how you locate the tag by voice prompts or you can go to the map i'm going to show you in a minute you can go to the map and track it on the map you can also change the ringtone so i have a bunch of different ringtones okay so i can pick a ringtone for the tag then when i tap on play it plays that uh the the ringtone that i picked for the tag the battery here says sufficient if i tap on this one it shows me sufficient means i have over 16 percent of battery life now remember the battery it takes a cr2032 battery inside it it does have a 300 day battery life so what you want to do is you want to periodically check this maybe maybe 100 days after you use this and make sure it's not at low it doesn't say low at the bottom if this is low you want to change the battery not a big deal those batteries are 10 a piece and it lasts you a whole year okay by the way let me go back here uh let me exit this thing okay i'm going to go to the smart things application over here smart things app right here so when i go there what you are going to see is this is my smart home so i have all my things here i got my uh smart things fine this is the map i can actually see the location of the smart tag on the map if i click it i'm not gonna do it right now just because of privacy because it shows exactly where i am on the map as well but this is my smartthings screen here and i have my car keys on the top remember you can tap on this button tap on edit and move things up and down so if i want my device the on the go device on the top i have it right there but when i click it it goes into that menu that we just saw tap on next okay and here we go so that's the specific menu for the car keys smart tag and you can always tap on this button and edit this to make any modifications you can change the name change the room that the whole thing is in which you don't have to worry about with this portable item because it's an on-the-go device so you tap on the room and you choose on the go it's not the office it's not the main bedroom it is on the go as you can see so i'm going to tap on save change the name or whatever now when i go back over here here's something really amazing i'm going to demonstrate in a second but if i press this i can take certain actions so if i press this then i can tap over here control devices notify somebody change this location's mode let's just go with control devices i'm going to tap on this one and let's say when i press this i want the hallway light to open up okay so next and it says turn on all right save here's a live example i'm going to press the button it's going to turn on and off the light look at that lights off and lights on incredible i can do this with the smart tag now when i save this i have a program here where i press when i press this it turns on the hallway light that is incredible now if i press and hold it i can have it do something else again if i press and hold then tap on plus i can control devices notify somebody change this location's mode run specific scenes off of my smart finds application so truly an incredible piece of product here with a lot of nice features added to it not only can you use this to find your keys your luggage your pet whatever that you want you can see its location on the map but you can also as i showed you guys use it to control other products program whatever you want to program into it all right so that's the uh galaxy smart tag now apple air tags are also great but remember you buy them and then you have to actually buy a loop another thirty dollars just to attach them to a key like this one here we already have a loop we already have a little hole and i can just put the key ring right into it or wherever i want to attach this to all right and also you don't have this button right here that you can press to turn on and off things which you have programmed into the actual button which is crazy but anyway i want to talk about the smart tags right away if you do have any questions comments or concerns drop them down below let me know for now guys have a fantastic day alright anime girls and whether or not i could beat them in a fight hey guys it's eden here also known as the coolest war criminal on the internet and today just like always i'm here to abuse some anime girls however instead of tearing apart their bodies limp by lemon photoshop today we are going to head over to my favorite website on the internet no not and hen we are going to go to the all holy tear maker dot com you see i tweeted saying reply to this tweet with your waifu slash husbando or just your favorite anime character in general and i will put them on a tier list in accordance to whether i could beat them in a fight or not so today ladies and gentlemen we are rolling up our sleeves and in this video we are going to get violent i made another video like this one just a couple months ago and it was super well received so well here we are again if you have any other ideas for videos i can do in this format or just want to help me out feel free to leave a comment down below and if this video hits 10 000 likes i will make another one relatively soon so please don't be afraid to get violent with the like button anyways let's fight some anime girls and put them on a tier list first up is the brand new waifu on the streets everybody's going absolutely crazy about her the new samsung virtual assistant yes it's a [ __ ] phone now this new samsung virtual girl is indeed incredibly attractive but by far her specialty is simply the amount of lewd arts that has been drawn of her twitter heart has switched in no time a quick trip accompanied by an adult of course to rule 34 we'll show you everything that you need to know seriously there is just so much it's horrifying how does this much art get made in such a short span of time oh my god oh oh dear god so when it comes to me fighting the samsung virtual assistant mano imano i'm afraid to say that i would lose but it wouldn't be because she's a sentient ai selling or data to china no no it would be for the simple fact that i would be going against the entire internet and an army of countless artists who just really wanna [ __ ] her this one-on-one fight in reality would be one on millions and i would suffer a crushing and agonizing defeat the virtual assistant may be extremely attractive but at the end of the day i would lose in combat she's going over here whatever next up is our beloved senko-san but this is no ordinary senko-san this is the rematch of a lifetime it would seem as if senko-san has been training furiously since our last battle if you're new to my channel it's a bit of a running gag that i like abusing senko-san in almost all of my videos but twitter user i'm bats submitted a version of senko-san that's just a little bit different from the original now normal senko-san would be a walk in the park of course i'd let her step on me first but i'd easily beat her up afterwards and probably enjoy the process of doing so for the simple fact that i hate senko-san but this specific rendition of senko-san if you will is simply built different and yeah i think it's pretty obvious i wouldn't stand a chance i have to wave the white flag against senko-san for the first time ever i know truly heartbreaking it's like the death of kim jong-il corey and subscribers are rolling in their graves right now feel free to leave a comment as to where you think it'd end up me fighting this super strong senko-san personally i think reuted senko-san would go somewhere around here on the tier list twitter user centaurus xyz submitted miyo akiyama from keon now considering miyo akiyama is the most violent and physical of all of them that may make one consider that this could be an even fight but i am here to remind you that she is just a japanese girl only 5'3 i could easily win this fight so in order to make it fair i decided to fight all five chaon girls at once i know by saying this i'm probably living out some weird deviant art fan fiction that already exists but the point still stands if i were to fight the entirety of hokkaido tea time including the [ __ ] turtle it would probably end up right about here twitter user draketh submitted urabe mikoto now i don't really know who this is apparently they're the main character from mysterious girlfriend x so that's pretty cool i've never watched it but a lot of people submit her i see her every single time so i decided to include her she must be some real waifu material i don't know anyways she doesn't look that strong but she does look mysterious am i right guys i'll put it right here i know you guys are probably tired of seeing me absolutely destroy little anime girls so i'll even the playing field out of it twitter user both star one two two submitted sephiroth from i i think he's from final fantasy i don't know to be completely honest with you i don't need to know anything about this man smash final fantasy or anything at all because if you look at this man you just know he has so much [ __ ] sex he is the living embodiment of sex and quite frankly i'll be the first one to admit i don't stand a chance just like my tank waifus i'm gonna have to place him all the way on the far right next up is yuka from touhou which was submitted by outcast ray which touhou i don't know because i honestly don't know what the [ __ ] touhou is you see people keep asking me to make a video about it but to be honest i just like the music memes and the plushies so don't expect any knowledge from me on this subject but i do know a little bit about yuka whether my knowledge comes entirely from toho hentai dojinji or not well i'll let you be the decider of that so yuka is a very sadistic person very very sadistic but she's also the final boss of touhou lotus land story now i was pretty good at dodgeball as a kid i'm pretty skinny pretty flexible but this uh i don't know if i can handle all this i don't know how many that's a lot of dodging so yuka would probably annihilate me even more so than senko-san but you see at least i would enjoy it in the process but the yuka submitted is actually a yuka fumo aka the fumo i own so i could actually recreate how the fight would go down in real life so basically yeah i mean that's it it ain't all that hard to beat a fumo let's put real yuka here and fumo fumoyuka over here twitter user lance arctor submitted bunny girl senpai from the anime bunny girl senpai now mai is a pretty generic waifu i don't know how this happened i feel like when the anime aired it was pretty low-key i could tussle with the muscle if maya is a bunny then i'm the fox if she was the prey then i am the predator i could handle my with ease she's probably going to end up right about here twitter user go diego ghost submitted the blue thing now i hate to steal rev's meme but please allow me to say that i would fight this woman given the first opportunity and lucky for me even though she is in a fantasy world with incredibly strong magical powers she is well you know useless so i could still kick her ass i also love the meme they use for this image the smart fella versus fart smeller this image has literally been sitting in the back of my head for months it refuses to go away i just keep thinking [ __ ] fart smell and laughing at the worst times anyways aqua would be a pretty fair fight all things considered but i would lean the match ever so close to a win for me i'd put it right around here twitter user [ __ ] grammarly submitted officer jenny who might i add is literally wielding a gun first of all since when do they have guns in the pokemon world second of all i'm not quite sure what you expect me to do against something like this why you want me to dodge a bullet it ain't happening buddy officer jenny is going over here a cab more like all cops are jenny am i right that's the pokemon lore that's that's a pokey theory okay so now that i've done a character that i clearly don't stand a chance against it's time to bring back the little babies who are easy to fight twitter user big bro submitted goku once again i'm not sure why people even reply with goku i'm almost certain that at this point i've made it evidently clear that goku simply does not stand a chance against me far far left all the way over here stop asking me the same question it's honestly really getting annoying at this point twitter user baby goose submitted rin shima also known as shima rin also known as shimarin anyways rin is probably pretty strong she goes camping and it's pretty outdoors and whatnot but she's also very short and small so i'd honestly consider this a pretty decent matchup but you see my friend hiding in public actually likes shima rin a lot so much so that he actually wants to be her so with that in mind to a certain extent this will inherently be a two-on-one fight since i know he's willing to die for her which any man should be for his waifu so i'm gonna have to put shima rin over here twitter user biggie cheese submitted caronie from hololive now i've never been the biggest fan of animal abuse i definitely put it lower on the abuse tier list probably right above child abuse but just below drug abuse but if it's a fight you want then it's a fight you are going to get i might lose my fingers in the process but carone would probably go right about here and last but not least it's everyone's favorite little mouse rat i honestly don't know nasrin from touhou nazir from touhou is really cool she can do all the fortnite dances and i can't personally say the same but at the end of the day she's going down she would easily make the biggest mistake she'd be way too focused on the cheese that she wouldn't even notice the trap if you know what i'm saying anyways that's about it huge thanks to capitan pursuant puddle bread and butter light honey girl seth duncan nugget dusk seraphim evan everly 2 rashapa jeffy games marquis harper mental penalty mitsu nvdw praise the nerf rodney iclap isaac and all my other patrons on patreon.com you are watching cold future TV hi welcome to another cold fusion video to go though here okay so what's going on here it seems that Samsung is planning to produce an 11 came over screen this surely is ridiculous has the technology department at the South Korean company finally just lost the plot it may seem that way but let's find out more according to Korea IT news Samsung is teaming up with over 13 local and international companies to try and have 11k display phones by 2018 what's interesting here is that the South Korean government itself is investing twenty six point five million dollars over the course of five years to make this a reality which I think puts a slightly nationalistic spin on things but more on this later so an eleven k resolution is obviously hard for us to fathom as people living in 2015 today's technology of 2.5 k phones pales in comparison so let's put the screen into perspective you guys out there who love specs may get a kick out of this assuming in 2018 that we have similar screen sizes like we have today an 11 k display will have a resolution of about eleven five twenty by sixty 480 pixels with a pixel density of 2250 PPI for comparison at galaxy s6 which is the sharpest phone at the moment has 577 PPI and an iPhone 6 has 407 put in pixel terms this screen would have a whopping 74 megapixels a modern 1080p screen is about 2 megapixels and a 4k display is about 8 megapixels so that's all well and good but the question must be asked and this is probably what you're all wondering what is the point well the point actually may not be what you think what you're about to hear is the primary point according to Samsung's display executive to hear young and I quote we are hoping that we are able to show these technologies at the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in Korea end quote it's basically primarily to show us South Korea's technological prowess on the world stage while everyone is looking you can now see why the South Korean government has a direct interest in this young goes on to say quote although some might think that xi K is over specification that consumers do not need this can work as a basis for the Korean display industry to take another leap if related materials and parts improve through this end quote so basically the secondary goal is that Samsung wants to move the whole display industry forward so is it possible well at the moment is hard to say directly on my end but I'd assume that with twenty six million dollars of direct funding a lot of progress will no doubt be made so another question that's quite important what about the practical uses what is such a high-resolution screen on a mobile phone going to be useful for well one obvious use is mobile virtual reality an area where today's 2.5 screens for well short of the clarity needed to mimic real life another such application is mobile convergence where a user can make use of mirrored projection on a much larger screen size with external inputs such as a keyboard and mouse okay but obviously there's going to be some drawbacks right what other negatives well obviously the more pixels you have the more power it takes to keep them lit in the heart of the onboard graphics unit has to work to change all those pixels so we'll see a massive decrease in performance and power efficiency however this may be offset by the growth in mobile performance by 2018 which could be anywhere from 4 to 16 times more capable than current day devices so what's the conclusion here well if I may inject some personal opinion I think 11k is overkill to be honest I think 4k resolution should be a happy ultimate screen specification for 2018 and beyond but then again I could be completely wrong after all Bill Gates famously stated in 1981 that 640 kilobytes of RAM should be enough for anyone so what do you guys think please leave a comment below anyway thanks for watching this has been - go go don't forget to give a thumbs up if you liked it and subscribe if you're new there's

twice as much as the next largest south korean corporation in order to house their more than 250 000 employees the electronics giant has built its own city just outside seoul today we're learning about the city that samsung built the samsung group which includes samsung electronics and samsung life insurance among others has an annual revenue of 208 billion dollars accounting for 17 of south korea's total gdp though it has been plagued by controversy in recent years it is by far one of the largest corporations on earth samsung produces everything from medical supplies to energy and they have substantial holdings in finance resort management and insurance in the first quarter of 2019 samsung shipped 71.9 million smartphone units compared to huawei and apple which shipped 59.1 million and 36.4 million respectively according to idc needless to say this company is extremely powerful only 30 kilometers outside of the south korean capital of seoul sits one of the largest urban corporate centers on the planet samsung digital city it's technically housed in the city of suwat an ancient community with roots going back as far as the 8th century huasiang fortress is suwon's most notable attraction built in 1796 the entire city used to be encircled by the walls but now suwon has expanded beyond this boundary huasiang is also listed as a unesco world heritage site but despite suwan's historical past samsung digital city is extremely modern though technically not a city it might as well be within 390 acres of office space there are almost 35 000 samsung employees four landmark office towers up to 38 floors high 131 smaller buildings with more labs offices recreational facilities and a guest house for visiting researchers it's unclear exactly how much the campus cost to construct but conservative estimates place the price at around 1 billion with many millions every year in upkeep and perks for employees there's also what's called samsung 5g city which consists of an outdoor park where the company tests 5g network equipment which is currently being deployed to telecom providers including in south korea and the us the sprawling campus includes cafeterias where employees eat for free a massive gym and includes international food and beverage outlets such as dunkin donuts while security is tight and heavily guarded the samsung innovation museum is open to the public and pays homage to the history of samsung along with a general history of technology products in addition events are organized each week including concerts fashion shows and talk shows and 690 cultural clubs keep employees entertained on their breaks these clubs span across interests from korean folk painting to paragliding and cooking on top of all this samsung's headquarters hosts 490 sports clubs and offers a swimming pool basketball and badminton courts and baseball diamonds there are bizarre otherworldly spaces like the multiple input multiple output or mimo wherein samsung tests different cell phone technology samsung is extremely quiet about the testing that takes place in the mimo however the futuristic space appears more like the cockpit of a spaceship samsung said more than 65 000 of its employees are dedicated to conducting research and development which is the equivalent to around twenty percent of its global workforce to encourage creativity amongst staff its seoul r d campus hosts a multi-story library where designers and employees can come to brainstorm and find inspiration amidst books and magazines the campus is also home to samsung's sound lab which features music equipment and voice booths where the voice of samsung's smartphone virtual assistant bixby is recorded it's also where sounds are created for many of its household appliances such as the sound a smartphone makes once it's plugged into an electrical outlet or the sound a refrigerator makes after its door has been left open for too long due to the rather minimal welfare services by the state in south korea samsung electronics provides many social benefits for its employees free of charge as the welfare state in south korea is only slowly emerging samsung electronics stands out as an attractive and reliable employer with its broad offering of free social services in samsung digital city these services include health care child care free food recreation and free public transportation in case you need to see a doctor during your stay in samsung digital city it is entirely free for samsung employees the healthcare service is free at samsung digital city with numerous medical facilities that offer everything from physicals and flu shots to dental treatments and traditional acupuncture samsung digital city has ten basketball courts four badminton courts three soccer fields two baseball diamonds a climbing wall and an olympic sized swimming pool it also serves up to 72 000 meals with 92 different menus daily the cafeteria with more than 4 100 seats sources its produce from suwon's neighborhoods creating a strong link with farmers and producers kindergartens with 150 teachers look after 900 children of samsung employees during the work week in addition the campus is home to a helicopter pad and free buses and trains for all their employees with a total number of vehicles in the hundreds when it's family day in samsung digital city the whole campus turns into a theme park for samsung families and residents and yes it includes the go-karts when it rains the company provides 9000 free umbrellas for each of its employees to use between buildings of course samsung's biggest competitors companies like apple huawei google and amazon all have secretive labs too but samsung has a reputation for throwing things against the wall to see if they stick often at a faster rate than its rivals that strategy is great when it works but it also leads to the occasional flop one example in 2019 when samsung rushed its folding phone galaxy fold to the market early reviewers complained of defective hinges and broken screens samsung pulled the phone tweaked the design and has since launched a new version in south korea and in 2016 samsung had one of its most legendary failures ever its galaxy 7 phones began spontaneously combusting and their stock tanked they were forced to recall one million phones though they have since regained their standing in public opinion Hello and welcome to Unpacked! It’s so good to be with you again! I could not be more excited about all the incredible innovations we’re announcing today. They continue Samsung’s legacy as the pioneer of meaningful experiences that are designed for everyone. Our universe is an entire ecosystem of intelligent, connected devices that defy expectations and give you the freedom to live life without borders, without boundaries. When it comes to true innovation we are the only game in town. Last year was a reminder of how important technology has become to all of us. Samsung Galaxy devices helped connect millions of friends and families, and enabled entire industries to go remote. During this next normal, we’ve been working hard to support our customers and employees with our innovations. The challenges of 2020 have made us more determined to fully tap the immense power and potential of tech. This year, Samsung is pushing innovation even stronger. We will give you groundbreaking ways to personalize your devices so they reflect you. Because we want you to be free, to go further, to forge your own path. Without limitations, without constraints. As part of our long-standing commitment to open collaboration, we will expand the Samsung universe even more with new partners. With Samsung Mobile, where you start your journey never determines where you will go. After all, every day should be truly epic. To kick things off, I want to introduce you to a product that I absolutely love one that I use all the time in fact. They may be small, but they sure are mighty. This powerful design statement offers a multi-dimensional audio experience that will blow you away. Meet the next generation of our incredible earbuds Galaxy Buds Pro! Here are the Galaxy Buds Pro, the most immersive sound experience on Galaxy Buds. We use earbuds to listen to our favorite music, watch our favorite movies,
and connect with the people we love. They help us tune into the content we care about and tune out the content we don’t. They even transport us to another world: just us and the audio we love. With earbuds, we can watch movies that center us… and listen to music that helps us connect with ourselves. Earbuds give us personal space when we need it most. If you listen to music often, you know what a big difference sound quality makes. The foundation of our Galaxy Buds lineup
is amazing sound… and Galaxy Buds Pro are packed with pro sound quality. Galaxy Buds Pro come with the most intelligent Active Noise Cancellation on true wireless earbuds. So you can transition seamlessly between your universe and the world around you. The Galaxy Buds Pro will make your listening experience extraordinary. Our engineers and designers worked closely together to bring this incredible sound experience to life. Let’s listen. The goal of Galaxy Buds Pro is simple: to deliver the best sound experience, period. Most earbuds immerse you in audio, and stop right there. But Buds Pro are different. They redefine the sound experience to transport your inner and outer worlds. This is the how the Galaxy Buds Pro are designed and engineered to enable a sound experience unlike any other. Nothing immerses us in our inner worlds
better than captivating sound. When building Galaxy Buds Pro, engineers were inspired by the highest quality
audio devices around: speakers. Most premium speakers use a two-way system: a woofer delivers bass,
and a tweeter delivers high pitches. They work together to create rich,
premium sound. But most wireless earbuds only use a one-way speaker system. The reason? Size. Building two-way speakers into a small earbud body requires an innovative solution. So engineers tried a new approach: System in Package, SIP minimizes the size of each chip organizes them into dense stacks to integrate all parts into a single component, for more optimal use of space. This breakthrough in engineering enables the Galaxy Buds Pro to feature two-way speakers The Galaxy Buds Pro set the standard for sound quality on wireless earbuds with stunning sound by AKG. But sound quality doesn’t end there. The Buds Pro deliver 360 Audio for realistic immersion. Using intelligent motion tracking sensors
and Dolby Head Tracking, Buds Pro can detect head movements. Now, when you turn your head, the audio will recalibrate
and put you in the middle of the scene. What really takes the audio to the next level, is Active Noise Cancelling. Galaxy Buds Pro use outer microphones to monitor ambient noise and its inner mic to monitor noise inside your ear. Based on these noise readings, the advanced chipset generates an anti-noise signal and eliminates up to 99 percent of background noise in real-time letting you enjoy only the sounds you want to hear. But as much as we love being immersed in our own worlds, we need to be able to connect with the world around us. Enter Intelligent Active Noise Control: With Intelligent ANC,
as soon as you start to speak, a microphone detects your voice while a sensor detects the vibrations An advanced AI algorithm then ensures your voice isn’t mistaken for other voices to confirm you’re in a conversation. And with improved latency, ambient sound on the Galaxy Buds Pro will sound more clear and natural than ever before. Intelligent ANC lets you hear and interact with your environment while your earbuds are still on, for truly seamless transition from immersion to communication. One aspect of sound that’s often overlooked is call quality. Buds Pro are designed with a voice pickup unit and three microphones to maximize call clarity. Once, the voice pickup unit detects your voice, two outer mics,
positioned directly toward the mouth, perform beamforming. Beamforming funnels your voice directly to the mic to minimize external noise and amplify your voice. There’s even a built-in solution to help you get around one of the most common pain points When on a call: wind. In design, the earbud itself has been reimagined with a more closed fit., At the hardware level, an outer mesh combines with an inner wind chamber to disperse and further neutralize wind. Finally, advanced software distinguishes between voice and wind sound patterns to ensure no leftover breeze makes its way into a call. With the Galaxy Buds Pro, it’s no longer necessary to choose between being immersed in your own world, and being able to connect with the world around you. Enjoy the ultimate sound experience with Galaxy Buds Pro — tiny yet powerful earbuds. Audio has the power to move us. Music transports us to different worlds. We get lost in stories through audiobooks and podcasts. And time flies when we’re chatting with our friends. Galaxy Buds Pro understand
and adjust based on what we’re doing. They can recognize when we’re listening to tunes or catching up with family… and figure out when we want to move from our phone to our tablet, and back again. And Auto Switch lets Galaxy Buds Pro switch with you. If you’re watching something on your tablet and your phone rings, don’t rush around. Galaxy Buds Pro will easily switch audio to the device you’re using. No need to fiddle with your settings or wait for a connection. Incredible sound quality is the most important part of any listening experience. We designed Buds Pro to deliver the clearest,
richest sound of any Galaxy device. And of course, form follows sound. We carefully studied the shape and contour of the ear to make Galaxy Buds Pro fit more securely. They’re designed to sit just right within three key parts of your ear. We also added a 2mm vent to the outer shell of the buds, to create air flow
and balance the pressure around your ear… so you’ll have a balanced fit without the feeling of tightness. I’m a runner,
and when I go on hourlong runs, most wireless earbuds fall out. Galaxy Buds Pro stay securely in my ears. I can trust that whenever I take my mask off or remove my hat and scarf, my buds will stay right where they are… And with IPX7, Galaxy Buds Pro have the highest standard of water resistance in the Galaxy Buds lineup. We intricately shaped every part of Buds Pro to make your everyday listening experiences exceptional — right down to the case you put them in! If you have a pair of Buds Live, we’ve made sure you can still use your accessories. You can get your own pair of Galaxy Buds Pro in three amazing colors. They’ll be available for $199 starting January 15th. Let’s take another look. With incredible sound quality, Intelligent ANC, and our most secure fit ever, Galaxy Buds Pro will transform your listening experience. But that’s not the only experience we’re enhancing today. Because technology doesn’t just transport us to different worlds. It makes all of our activities easier and more convenient. The smartphone is one of our most helpful and most personal devices. But we’ve all experienced that panic
from misplacing our phone. It can instantly ruin our day. So we’ve expanded one of our favorite services to help keep track of the things that matter most to you: SmartThings Find. We’ve made our web service even easier to use, and we’ve brought the service to your phone by adding it to our SmartThings app. SmartThings Find has given you peace of mind when it comes to locating your phone. Last October,
we extended it to help you track and locate your wireless earbuds, tablets,
and smart watches. And this year,
we’re expanding SmartThings Find even further, so you can track any of your belongings — even if they don’t have a built-in connection — with Galaxy SmartTag. Galaxy SmartTag allows you to take charge of
your everyday belongings in an extraordinary way. It’s a small, portable device you’ll be able to easily attach to the things you love most, whether or not they have their own connection. And its coin-sized battery lasts for months — so you can trust that SmartTag
will help you track down your favorite things, even if they’ve been gone for a while. Imagine that you left your door open and your dog ran off. You’d feel panicked, not knowing where your pet has gone. With Galaxy SmartTag on his collar, you’ll be able to track him using SmartThings Find. If he’s far away,
the SmartTag on your dog’s collar can send Bluetooth signals
to a community of nearby Galaxy users, who can help you track it down. The Galaxy Find Network that powers SmartThings Find is encrypted from end to end, so you can track down your SmartTag while keeping all data from Galaxy users in the network untraceable. Once SmartThings Find locates your SmartTag, it will notify you about its whereabouts… and you’ll experience the relief that comes from reuniting with your dog. You can attach a SmartTag to your wallet, your suitcase, or even your bicycle. And if you have trouble finding your SmartTag, you’ll be able to ring it, and follow the sound! Remote tracking services can help you locate your possessions to the nearest block, or building. But wouldn’t it be great if you could find the precise location of your lost item? With Galaxy SmartTag+,
you can! Galaxy SmartTag+ is built with ultra-wideband technology, or UWB: an advanced wireless communication system that makes your devices smarter by giving them spatial accuracy and directional capabilities. And this same system can help you locate things by combining the power of navigation with AR. Thanks to UWB and AR finder, Galaxy SmartTag+ will help you locate your belongings with unprecendented accuracy by guiding you to their location. They’ll take you to the bookcase in the corner of your office that your keys fell behind. Losing pets and personal items is a common problem. But with Galaxy SmartTag+, you’ll be able to find your favorite things wherever you left them. And we’ve made sure you’ll love your SmartTag as much as you love the things you put it on. We’ve made cases to fit all your needs — and to show off your unique style. You can get a SmartTag on January 29th… and you’ll be able to get a SmartTag+ later this year. Galaxy Buds Pro and Galaxy SmartTag transform everyday moments into experiences you’ve never imagined. And the best part is, they’re not the only extraordinary devices we’re sharing with you today. Back to you, TM! Thank you Liz. The Galaxy Buds Pro and Smart Tag are such great additions to the Samsung ecosystem! But, we’re not done yet. We live in a mobile-first world, and you deserve the ultimate mobile experience. This year, we wanted to give you something different: a giant leap forward. To empower you to express yourself, and live your life exactly how you want. I’m so proud to introduce our new flagship device, the Galaxy S21! Designed for how you live today, but loaded with the innovation of tomorrow, Galaxy S21 is groundbreaking on all fronts. It has an iconic,
boundary-defying design that will turn heads. The fastest chip ever for a Galaxy together with our most complete software and user experience. And an epic camera far beyond anything we’ve made before so good that it makes everyone look like a pro. Especially its video capabilities, where you have the power of cinema
in the palm of your hands. I’m incredibly excited to introduce a smartphone that changes everything to make your everyday epic. I’m so excited to finally be able to tell you about the Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus. These days, we rely on our phones even more than we used to. They help us discover new music,
chat with our friends, and just enjoy the everyday. With Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus, you’ll have a device that changes everything and helps you get the most out of every moment. A smartphone that makes the everyday epic. Our phones reflect our style and taste — and this year, we’re ready for something new. We created a revolutionary new photo and video experience, with incredible enhancements in our camera technology. That much innovation requires a fresh new design to match. And that’s why the S21 series looks like nothing you’ve seen before. We created a contour-cut design by combining the camera shell with the frame of the phone, covering the camera fully in metal. This camera housing is stronger and more durable than when it was covered in glass — and your phone’s design is stylish and seamless. Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus will catch people’s attention
everywhere you go, with their elegant frames, contour-cut cameras, and bold metal housing. And we’ve created color combinations that stand out. Galaxy S21 comes in four colors, while S21 Plus comes in three. We give you different options to fit your unique style. These devices are designed to open up a world of extraordinary new experiences — starting with their stunning,
world-class displays. After all, the display is one of the most important parts of any smartphone. We use it to chat with our friends, and watch movies that make us laugh. No matter how great a phone’s design or camera is, you need an amazing display to get the most from your device. At Samsung, we are the industry leader in brilliant displays, providing the best viewing experience on Galaxy devices,with edge-to-edge AMOLED screens. We invested in AMOLED screens from the beginning, giving you a more vivid viewing experience than LCD screens. Last year, we introduced a super-smooth viewing experience on our S20 devices, with the 120Hz display. When you use a phone that smooth, you’ll wonder how you ever lived without it. Today, we’ve made another leap forward, building the S21 series with an adaptive screen that goes between 48 and 120Hz. Whether you’re scrolling through your social feed or photo gallery, your viewing experience is optimized for your content. The contrast ratio and unbelievable peak brightness let you enjoy all the vivid colors
in the content you’re watching — even if you’re outside on a bright, sunny day. But this display doesn’t just look better: it’s also better for you. Blue light can make it hard for us to sleep, and it often hurts our eyes. Our new Eye Comfort Shield analyzes your usage pattern to automatically adjust your blue light filter. That way, your eyes will stay comfortable no matter what. Whether you choose Galaxy S21 and its 6.2-inch display… or the S21 Plus and its 6.7-inch display… you will get the most advanced, intelligent display we’ve ever put on a smartphone. With vivid colors, an adaptive refresh rate,
and Eye Comfort Shield, you’ll be totally immersed in this new screen. The display is your window to all the epic experiences that the S21 series makes possible. So of course, you want to make sure it’s well-protected. We built these phones with our toughest front glass yet, so you can have peace of mind. Our phones are a natural extension of everything we do. We don’t even think about it. We pull out our phones to take pictures with friends, or when we see something cool while we walk down the street. For those moments we expect — and for those we don’t — our cameras are essential. With the Galaxy S21 series, you can capture, keep,
and relive the moments that matter, with pro-like photo and video quality. Thanks to AI, this pro-grade camera
does all the thinking for you. It knows how to adjust its settings to give you the brightest, most natural photos, with three lenses that render your memories crisp and clear. That kind of intelligence turns everyday photography
into an epic experience. And it’s all possible with the computing power
of Galaxy S21’s brand-new processor. I end up taking lots of photos when I go on trips. But the pictures I come back to most aren’t landscapes or scenery… they’re portraits of people I care about: my friends goofing off, or my sisters enjoying a night out. And the higher the quality of these images, the more it feels like they’re in the room with me. With the combination of our new chipset
and photo-enhancing AI capabilities, S21 and S21 Plus capture every detail — and provide you with more natural and vivid portraits than ever before. The portrait experience on the S21 series is simply amazing. These new devices will automatically separate the subjects
from their backgrounds, to bring depth and focus to your photos. And the intelligent camera on S21
and S21 Plus enhances the natural bokeh effect, whether in broad daylight or in the dark... so you can capture beautiful portraits under the stars. The S21 series has various Portrait modes that accentuate the subject and make them pop. Our new devices even detect the direction of light to help you capture studio-quality portraits. With Studio mode, AI adjusts the lighting to create perfect portraits
that look crisp and natural. High-Key or Low-Key Mono modes round out your photo… and you can even have AI select matching colors to automatically create a stunning backdrop. We know you love the portraits you take of friends and family… including your pets! They deserve the best-quality portraits, too. The S21 series captures amazing portraits of your four-legged friends, using AI to save every detail. Portraits are a great way to take gorgeous photos of the people — and pets — we love. But sometimes,
I want to snap a shot of another important person: Me! Selfies are how I show the world my best looks… and how I bring my friends into my favorite moments. With AI-based face enhancement, you can enjoy high-quality selfies anytime, anywhere. Using a super-smart image signal processor and advanced multi-frame processing, the camera makes your selfies look their absolute best. And when you’re taking a selfie, the lighting is so important right?. With enhanced Auto White Balance, S21 and S21 Plus ensure your natural skin tone will be reflected in any lighting conditions — even extremely warm or colorful lighting — without sacrificing the realness of your photo. Social media helps us connect with others and express ourselves. And sometimes, when we want to share a picture, it’s easier to use the camera that’s built into our favorite apps. We’ve been working closely with our partners to make the awesome visual experience from our Galaxy devices available on their apps. Now, the AI solution on S21 and S21 Plus gives you an incredible visual experience in most third-party camera apps, like Instagram and Snapchat. With these upgrades, the S21 series will help you take and post the best pictures possible. But of course, our social media feeds are more than portraits and selfies. More and more often, we’re using videos to communicate and capture real-time reactions… moments that make us cry, and make us laugh until we cry. With the S21 series, you can capture every detail in cinematic quality, without any extra effort, thanks to 8K video. 8K is a revolution in video resolution. 8K video is four times sharper than 4K, giving you super-high quality in every shot. These videos are so sharp, you no longer have to choose between taking a photo or a video anymore. With 8K Video Snap, you can pull photos from your videos at 33MP — so your screen caps will look like portraits. You can discover shots within shots, and stories within stories. Just record, then tap once during playback, and… snap! You’ll capture all the main moments, and every single epic one in between. Sometimes when you want to get just the right shot, you spend so much time adjusting your camera, then the moment’s gone… Not anymore. Single Take on the S21 series will change the way you take videos — by enabling you to shoot photos and videos all at once. Just hold the camera for up to 15 seconds, and your phone does all the thinking for you. It’s like having a personal editor inside your phone, easily creating photos, videos, and boomerangs you can share immediately. And you won’t have to worry about which filter to use, or whether you need to reshoot. Single Take will give you a bunch of options to share right away. But sometimes,
you want to do more than point and shoot. You want to choose the right angles, focus on your subjects, and change your view as you film. So we thought about new ways we could give you control over your camera… and we created a new visual experience called Director’s View. Now, you can see preview thumbnails from all your camera lenses while you shoot. That way, you can easily change angles, zoom in, go wide, and close up — all while filming. You can make sure the video of your moment is just as epic as the moment itself. All of these amazing camera capabilities — from Portraits and Selfies, to Single Take and Director’s View — are powered by the fastest chipset in a Galaxy device. We’ve engineered our chipset to give you more: more speed, more energy efficiency, and more possibilities. At 5 nanometers, this chip represents the most significant leap in our chip performance ever — and that starts with the CPU. We’re delivering 20 percent faster CPU, 35 percent faster GPU, and 2 times faster AI. And we’ve adopted ARM architecture to significantly increase our overall chipset speed, giving you the power to reach 20 tera operations per second. That means the S21 series can process graphics and AI faster than any other Galaxy device. So whether you’re taking portraits… recording videos… or starting the next viral trend on TikTok… you’ll have the power to capture extraordinary memories. We rely on our phones more than ever to get things done… so the security of our most sensitive information
is more important than ever. At the heart of our enhanced security system is a Secure Processor, which is engineered to ensure that your data stays protected even against advanced hardware attacks. For the S21 series, we worked closely with both Qualcomm Technologies and Samsung’s System LSI business to develop a Secure Processor that meets our stringent security requirements. In addition, we brought a whole new layer of protection, customized for this processor, by adding a physical,
tamper-resistant Secure Memory. We call it Knox Vault. With a Secure Processor, Secure Memory,
and integrated software... this vault will safely store your device PIN and password, biometrics and blockchain, and Samsung service authentication keys. We also upgraded the S21 series’ privacy features for the pictures and text files you share. Now, you’ll be able to remove location metadata from photos, to keep your location private. And if you have photos, videos, or text files that you want to share with friends, but you don’t really want them to keep, we’ve got a solution for you. With Private Share, you can share your content,and revoke access whenever you please… or just let it naturally expire after 2 days, so you can send your content worry-free. With our Knox security and super-intelligent processor, the Galaxy S21 series is our most private and powerful yet. And S21 and S21 Plus will last all day… even in a 5G network. Two years ago, we launched the world’s first commercial 5G smartphone… and our leadership continues with HyperFast 5G, engineered to give you the best network experience possible. 5G will unlock faster, and more connected experiences, giving you more of what you love, with less lag. That high-level connectivity makes the S21 series the perfect phone for everyday mobile gaming. As you know,
we’ve been collaborating with Microsoft to bring you Xbox games on mobile via the cloud. 5G makes it possible to take your favorite games with you while keeping them fast, smooth, and stunning, right on your phone. And that’s not the only gaming experience our S21 devices lets you enjoy. We continue to partner with Unity to build the ultimate mobile gaming experience. With Unity, we developed Adaptive Performance, giving you the games you love, without the battery drain or overheating you find on other devices. With this package and our new, powerful processor, the graphics get better, the phone stays cooler, and gameplay gets faster than on previous Galaxy devices. Adaptive Performance has been applied to over 100 gametitles so far, and this list will only grow in the years to come. With ultra-high performance on our best-ever processor, an everyday game will take you on an extraordinary adventure. The S21 series offers the most powerful Galaxy devices we’ve ever made, inside and out. >From chip to camera, they are truly exceptional smartphones that let you turn every day into an amazing experience.

Whether you choose S21 or S21 Plus, you’re guaranteed a device that will change the way you navigate our world. But they’re not the only revolutionary devices we’re launching today. Introducing: Galaxy S21 Ultra. Wow, how impressive was that? There’s a lot to unpack here. As you just heard from Yoonie, the S21 series turns everyday moments into extraordinary experiences. And Galaxy S21 Ultra takes it all up a notch. It’s a smartphone built for people who want more. More freedom, more power, and more ways to shape the world around them. Our Ultra line has become synonymous with the best of the best in the Galaxy lineup. It’s packed with our latest innovations… our most advanced technology… and our most seamless user experience. We built S21 Ultra with our most powerful processor, amazing display, and of course…
our incredible pro-grade camera, so you never miss a single moment. As a new dad, I’m always taking photos of my 20-month-old son. I want to capture every memory, from his first steps to his first word, so I thought about investing in a DSLR. But with this phone, I don’t need to. Galaxy S21 Ultra combines industry-leading hardware and software to provide a next-generation photo and video experience. We built studio-quality camera gear right into the device. Our four cutting-edge lenses give you an enhanced visual experience… and open up a world of possibilities. With the support of precise laser autofocus, the 108MP wide lens broadens the scope of what you can capture. The 12MP ultra-wide lens adds more detail to every picture you take. And with our enhanced AI, the brand-new, dual-tele lens system creates a breakthrough in zoom quality. Our hardware and software teams worked together to build a camera experience unlike any other. This is a true pro camera… and we’re so excited to tell you more about it. We carry our smartphones all the time wherever we go. Whether posing for a family portrait, capturing incredible landscapes, or even something unexpected, we naturally reach for our smartphones. And in all of these moments, we want to capture the best, high-quality photos and videos every time. But this can be difficult depending on the environment and lighting conditions. At Samsung, our goal is to help everyone take pro-quality photos and videos, no matter the environment… and it all starts with our most advanced image sensor. The Galaxy S21 Ultra’s powerful camera experience starts with its upgraded 108 mega pixel image sensor. Its optimized to elevate image quality, for various shooting environments. In situations with ample lighting, re-mosaic technology maximizes resolution to produce stunning photos by rearranging and optimizing all of the camera’s 108 million pixels according to RGB bayer patterns. The Galaxy S21 Ultra’s new re-mosaic algorithm uses two times more pixels than before to create images with more clarity, detail, and sense of texture. Low light situations provide a more challenging environment. When pixels do not receive enough light, images produce noise – irregular, grainy spots that distort the image. Enter groundbreaking nona binning technology. At the sensor stage, a set of 9 pixels are combined into one larger pixel, increasing each pixel’s surface area for capturing light. This ensures the sensor gets enough light to produce bright, detailed photos, even in darker environments. And in extreme darkness – when even the human eye struggles to see – the S21 Ultra sensor uses AI for a powerful Night Mode experience. With one press of the shutter, multiple frames are processed at incredible speeds to eliminate noise and blur. Then, countless reams of data collected by the sensor are processed by an internal AI ISP algorithm to identify and preserve the subject’s true shape and color tone. This is possible even in conditions of extreme darkness under 0.1 lux. The results are stunning. In the case of backlighting, especially when the subject is in motion, groundbreaking 12 bit HDR combines two simultaneously captured 10 bit frames into a single 12-bit output. This process not only eliminates motion blur, but also produces dynamic range 3 times wider than that of 10 bit color. Extra-ordinary hardware sets the foundation to capture professional-quality images in any situation. But hardware is only half the story. Powerful software maximizes the strengths and benefits of our incredible hardware. Zoom photography is one area where this harmony of hardware and software turns your picture into a masterpiece. Let’s say you’re on a hike and you come across an amazing view… but you can’t actually get to the other side. What would you do? Would you give up? Well, you don’t need to because our Space Zoom will take you there. These are the kinds of moments that inspire our technology. It is this tight integration of innovative hardware
and powerful software that allows us to realize our vision for Galaxy S21 Ultra. Space Zoom on the Galaxy S21 Ultra is a turning point in the zoom experience, offering superb clarity between 1x and 100x zoom. To improve image quality in the 1-10x zoom range, innovative dual zoom combines mid-range 3x optical zoom with long distance 10x optical zoom to provide an optimized and balanced range of choices. But fitting 10x optical zoom into the slim body of a smartphone is not easy. To make this possible, two precise folds are incorporated into the lens design to minimize thickness and length. Mirrors direct light across sharp angles and pathways to produce pro-level magnification without the need for more lens equipment. The end result is a powerful, yet compact double folded lens that fits perfectly within a small space. >From 10 to 100x zoom, image quality is boosted by powerful Super Resolution AI. At one push of the shutter, up to 20 frames are captured and processed at instantaneous speeds. Advanced AI then evaluates and corrects thousands of fine details to produce detailed images, even at high magnification levels. And, when shooting with at high magnifications, Zoom Lock uses intelligent software to set the image in place so you can shoot with minimal shake. The Galaxy S21 Ultra provides hardware and software excellence up to 100 times zoom, but the zoom experience covers more than just long-distance shooting. The four lens optical system provides a range of optimized focal lengths, including one for intense macro shots. The S21 Ultra’s camera uses its laser autofocus sensor to measure the distance between lens and subject in real-time. If an object within 30 centimeters is detected, the camera automatically switches to the new 12MP ultra-wide lens – now with autofocus – and applies optimal macro settings for extreme close ups up to 5 centimeters in distance. Combining top-of-the-line hardware with groundbreaking, newly-evolved software, the Galaxy S21 Ultra captures incredible details, all with just a press of the shutter. Galaxy S21 Ultra’s camera is for people who appreciate the best of the best. It’s for pro photographers and videographers, for people who live for the details, and for everyone who enjoys taking extraordinary pictures. S21 Ultra has the most power we’ve ever built into a smartphone camera, giving you the freedom to shoot and edit your favorite moments to make them even more memorable. You’ll be able to capture incredible 12-bit RAW files in Pro Mode. This phone has three times more dynamic range than photos on the S20 — so you won’t miss a single detail. But your photos are just the beginning. S21 Ultra offers the best-quality video ever on a smartphone. Our S21 series will let you shoot 4K video at 60 frames per second with every lens on your phone — front, tele, wide, and ultra-wide lens alike. Let’s take a look! Wasn’t that great? At Samsung, we believe filmmaking should be possible for everyone So we’re building our Galaxy smartphones to establish a whole new kind of cinema: Mobile Filmmaking. Our advanced smartphone cameras give artists the agility to shoot what they want… and push the boundaries of what they can create. And we’re excited to continue to grow the #withGalaxy community around the world. Whether you’re directing a film or taking photos of your family, the content you capture with S21 Ultra will be incredible… and you’ll be able to store it effortlessly thanks to our Microsoft OneDrive integration. If you start filming a masterpiece on your phone, you can upload it to OneDrive, and then edit your work from your PC. Galaxy S21 Ultra is a bold device that delivers the best of the best. And we designed it to look just as bold and iconic, from its sleek frame to its stunning matte finish. It’s a masterstroke in design… and we created a striking color to match. Introducing: Phantom Black. When it comes to design, black isn’t just a color…
it’s all colors in one. It’s bold, yet understated. Black is classic. Style. Luxury. Elegance itself. For designers, black is the most difficult color to create. To understand its qualities, we studied all the ways it is used — in cars, fashion, art, and more. Black comes in many different shades but in the design world, there is only one perfect black. We aspired to craft ablack that stays true at every angle and reflection of light. In our quest, we conducted countless tests. We examined molding, the process to create color patterns. Vapor deposition,
the process to create the reflective layer. We even examined glass etching. Nothing was quite right. Our experiments showed that any process we added only reduced the black’s intensity. To reach the color that encompasses all others, we found that less is more. We needed to subtract. Removing the traditional processes was an extreme, uncompromising gesture, but we needed to break new ground. We put all our focus on just two parts of the phone — black film, and haze glass. First, we built the film base with new materials, creating a black that absorbs almost all light. Then, we worked to find the perfect haze formula. We varied times of etching,
changed the thickness of the glass, and even tested different mixtures and concentrations of the etching solution. Finally, we had a breakthrough: we discovered an optimal haze glass that preserves a deep, resonant black, one that shows the color in its truest form. The result of all these efforts is the Galaxy S21 Phantom Black. Strong, fluid, and modern, We fashioned this singular black not by adding more, but by using less. Unforgettable and unapologetic: this is S21’s Phantom Black. Phantom Black is our boldest color yet… for the most advanced, innovative phone we’ve ever made. S21 Ultra is an epic experience in and of itself. That best-in-class experience continues with S21 Ultra’s display. >From shooting incredible videos to watching and sharing them, this display lets us do all the things we love. The Galaxy S21 series boasts intelligent displays that save power and optimize your viewing experience. And S21 Ultra is our most intelligent display yet. We found an organic structure that sets the groundwork of our AMOLED display. And we’ve applied this newly-discovered material to S21 Ultra. With this innovation, we’ve managed to reduce power consumption in this device — even as we provide an improved viewing experience in high resolution. As you switch between videos, or pause to check emails, your phone will automatically shift between 10 and 120Hz to optimize your viewing experience. At the same time, our improved, super-smooth scrolling experience in WQHD+ resolution will keep up with you. You’ll get all these capabilities in the brightest, most vivid display we’ve ever built into a smartphone. This powerful device has a 6.8” Display with a maximum brightness of 1500 nits With the Dynamic AMOLED 2X screen on our S21 Ultra, you’ll have our most stunning display experience yet: 25 percent brighter than Galaxy S20 Ultra, with 50 percent more contrast and 100 percent color volume, for more accurate, realistic color. S21 Ultra’s display is our most advanced ever… and we made sure every part of your experience will match it. That’s why we’re introducing Wacom technology to S21 Ultra, and making it the first-ever S series device compatible with the S Pen. For all the Galaxy Note users out there, you know that the S Pen is more than just a pen. It puts precision at your fingertips, so you can take charge of your mobile experience. You can use it to write, draw, and make more precise edits. We’re introducing two new, independent S Pens today: the standard model — now bigger and with a more comfortable grip — and the more advanced S Pen Pro.

Hi TM, thanks for your warm welcome, and I’m really excited to join Unpacked today! We’re so grateful for the close partnership with Samsung, and what we’ve been able to build together since the first Galaxy S smartphone! Now, it’s been over a decade, and I think today’s launch highlights a new era for Samsung and Google. The Galaxy S21 is a major step forward, as we’ve pushed the boundaries with Samsung and their world-class technology to create an amazing, cohesive product experience. Not only are we bringing our innovations closer together on the phone, we also recognize it’s a multi-device world, so we are building beyond the phone, together. As TM mentioned earlier, staying connected with friends and family is a top priority for many of us. Google Duo and Messages are great examples of how we’ve worked with Samsung to make these apps more helpful and easy to use. On Messages, we have completed the global roll out of RCS on Android. For those of you not familiar with RCS, it’s the next generation of texting that replaces SMS. You can enjoy enhanced features like chatting over Wi-Fi, seeing if someone has received and read your messages, sharing reactions, and doing all of this on your other devices like PCs, too! We’re also passionate about developing experiences that are designed for each and every user. The seamless integration of Discover will provide personalized, high-quality content on the S21, with a single swipe from your home screen. And as part of our commitment to make computing accessible to everyone, we’ve collaborated with Samsung to develop a new version of TalkBack,
a Google screen reader, available first on Galaxy. This can really help shape the future of how everyone interacts with their phones. We are in a multi-device world. The smartphone is just one of many screens you interact with throughout the day. As you saw earlier — with Android Auto, Google Nest, and SmartThings — we’re investing deeply with Samsung to ensure our collaborations extend across devices, beyond the phone. The latest Android 11 release gives you more control over your data and privacy than ever before! For those of you interested in using the S21 for work, you’ll be pleased to learn that it’s an Android Enterprise Recommended device. The S21 exceeds the program’s elevated hardware and software requirements for business use. The Galaxy S21 is an incredible device that brings the best of the Samsung and Google collaboration. I’m inspired by what we’ll be able to build together, by bringing the magic of the Google ecosystem and Samsung’s amazing technology together — to innovate and to create helpful experiences for you, our customers. In 2021 and beyond, we are taking our partnership to the next level and I am incredibly excited for this new era! Kudos to the Samsung team and thanks again for inviting us! Back to you, TM. Thank you Hiroshi! Today, we’ve shown you what Samsung is all about: true innovation that opens up a world of untapped imagination. A universe of experiences that defy all expectations. So that you have the freedom, and the tools, to be yourself and to express yourself. Of course, the power to imagine new products goes hand in hand with the power to imagine a better world. We have always been committed to using technology as an instrument for good. To doing the right thing for the betterment of the world. That commitment led us to partner with the UNDP and help promote the Global Goals on more than 80 million smartphones. Just a few months ago, we announced our expansion of this partnership with “Generation17”. This program highlights the amazing work of our young leaders. Like Maximo, who is addressing climate change in Argentina and Shomy, who is raising health and hygiene awareness around the world. Generation17 is about elevating the voice of a generation, unlocking their power of purpose, and taking action together. Young people are coming of age during a global pandemic, and their optimism,determination, and resilience is more important than it’s ever been. We’re honored and humbled to help them reach their goal. We all have the power to affect change. It only takes imagination and a sense of purpose. I hope you will join us on this mission. On behalf of everyone at Samsung, thank you again for watching Unpacked today. Stay safe out there, and we look forward to seeing you again soon! a52 m62 a72 phone services your samsung galaxy a32 smartphone storage variant your phone says options are available [Music] design

news we have some update regarding the under display camera for the galaxy s22 lineup as well as the snapdragon model of the s22 series yes qualcomm's next big processor is coming and it reveals some very surprising details courtesy of ev leaks one of the most trusted sources when it comes to the leaks game the sm-8450 is qualcomm's next-gen premium chip it might actually be called as snapdragon 895. the most surprising bit about this is that it's actually going to be based on a four nanometer process it's also going to pack qualcomm's latest and the fastest 5g modem the snapdragon x65 other than that the cairo 780 cpu will be built on rm's latest cortex v9 technology that was announced a month ago adreno 730 gpu updated camera isp faster 5g speeds official support for lpddr5 ram plus more exciting stuff it's actually going to be a very well challenger to samsung's exynos 2200 amd processor now speaking of exynos 2200 another source has commented that it's also going to be based on four nanometer process compared to the previously rumored five nanometer he also said there is no performance jump when it comes to five nanometer and four nanometer comparison but there will definitely be a efficiency gain and once again samsung foundry could be responsible for manufacturing the next snapdragon processor as well as exynos 2200 chip so there we go galaxy s22 lineup will be one of the first flagship phones to get a four nanometer processor we'll see massive performance gains on both variants again samsung is set to bring its absolute best with amd we'll see which one eventually comes on top also in the news we've got some huge update regarding the under display camera status for the galaxy s22 lineup according to korean media as of now samsung is not getting the result that they wanted from the under display camera mass production yield while also not getting the result that they wanted when it comes to the camera quality if that remains the case then the galaxy s22 lineup might come without under display camera korean media further says that the proper under display camera implementation is only possible after the second half of 2022 which means it's likely to happen around the note 22 lineup launch now again nothing is final the s22 lineup is far from mass production so we still have yet to see its design so until then we can hope for the best as for the fold three it is indeed coming with the under display camera according to ice universe the light transmission rate is pretty good which means that the camera image quality will be close to a traditional front camera sensor but the look of under display camera might not be perfect so he gave this example where you can see a sort of a moziac pattern where the under display camera is supposed to be now other twitter elixir said that the mosaic circle shape is only visible when the display is fully white in most situations with colors you will not be able to see the under display camera and it's going to be completely invisible so yeah guys i'm really excited for the fold three the under display camera on this samsung product will give us an idea of what to expect for the galaxy s 22 lineup let's so for the best let me know your thoughts in the comment section below with that being said i'll catch you guys later peace out [Music] young ting you going [Music] crazy i

last year, consumers, as well as Samsung itself, were looking forward to the release of its
successor the Galaxy S21 FE. With the Galaxy Note phone delayed to next
year, the S21 FE is an important launch for Samsung because it's the only mainstream nonfoldable
flagship phone they have to offer in the second half of the year. But turns out, things are taking an ugly turn
for Samsung as the future of the S21 FE hangs in the balance as Samsung has suspended the
handset indefinitely. A South Korean website ETNews broke this news
earlier this day saying that Samsung has suspended production of the S21 FE. Samsung’s supply partners were apparently
informed that the manufacturer was suspending the production of S21 FE parts and canceling
orders for various materials. Some insiders from South Korea believe that
it's due to the global chip shortage. One insider told ETnews and I quote, “I
know that Samsung has allocated Qualcomm SoC's to foldable phones and suspended the FE model
because there are not enough semiconductors,” I mean it makes sense as one of the big reasons
Samsung suspended the Galaxy Note this year is because of the global chip shortage that's
affecting everyone. Qualcomm said that the chip shortage could
last until late 2021, while Intel says the shortfall could last for a couple of years. But Ice Universe is saying that it doesn't
have to do with the chip problem but due to the battery. He says It's not that the battery is in short
supply, it's that the parts required by S21 Fe's new technology are not up to standard,
and this part may be related to the battery and it doesn't affect other models. Interestingly he deleted the tweet later on
which suggests it may not have to do with what he's saying and actually is due to the
global chip shortage. Fortunately, Samsung replied to Bloomberg
saying that quote-unquote “While we cannot discuss details of the unreleased product,
nothing has been determined regarding the alleged production suspension.” To an extent, this can be viewed as a sort
of confirmation, but the vague wording leaves plenty of room for interpretation. I mean it could imply that the S21 FE could
be delayed by a month or two but there's a possibility that if the situation gets worse,
the device may end up being canceled altogether which is a big blow to fans who are looking
forward to the launch of the handset. Interestingly, another report mentions that
the issue may have something to do with "a cycle between existing products," which suggests
Samsung could be planning to space out releases, possibly to prevent cannibalization. I mean the S21 and S21 FE are basically identical
devices except for the minor screen size differences, they share identical designs and features. So it does make sense but you need to know
that all of this is speculation at this point. But the fact remains that the S21 FE's production
has been stopped abruptly and that's a big deal because it either results in a lengthy
delay or may end up being canceled altogether. In any case, I'll keep you posted so do consider
subscribing for that and as always I'll see you tomorrow...Peace out [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] samsung galaxy m01 core 20 rear camera 8 megapixel front camera 5 megapixel ram 1gb about 2gb room

the next big war what's up guys we're back with the latest news so as we know smartphones are evolving they've sort of hit their peak and well samsung is about to ignite the next big super cycle replacement which is said to be the foldable smartphones samsung is without a doubt leading this game and it's time to get everyone on board according to the recent report from october of this year samsung display will start supplying foldable oled panels to google xiaomi and vivo furthermore in early next year samsung will also be supplying its oled display to oppo and oneplus this means that we could see a swarm of foldable smartphones from multiple brands possibly by the end of this year and in 2022. the report doesn't mention apple but the biggest apple analyst aka mingxiko recently said that it's decided that samsung will be the exclusive foldable oled supplier for apple's upcoming foldable iphone in his report he further mentioned that apple is aiming big bigger than samsung has ever aimed they're aiming to launch about 15 to 20 million foldable iphone units in 2023 a number that is far bigger than samsung's 7 million units that they have allegedly planned for this year's foal 3 and z flip 3 combined apple is also expected to use the nanowire solution to its flexible oled screen which is said to be superior to samsung's why octa solution when it comes to usage is concerned ming chico further says that apple could be the biggest winner of foldable smartphone war because of the insane software and hardware plus third-party app optimization control they have the third-party app issue still persists even after two generations of samsung's foldable smartphone so this control of software and hardware will give apple a big boost i can't wait to see what all these other brands will bring to the table with their foldable smartphones and yeah it's going to be the next big war also in the news samsung has made a major announcement that they will be announcing a brand new 50 megapixel iso cell sensor that is marketed as iso cell for everyone this sensor is said to have 0.7 micrometer pixel size and is said to rely on the latest software technologies from samsung such as the dual pixel pro technology as well as iso pro for that improved low light performance judging from the marketing tag line it's definitely going to be provided to a lot of other smartphone manufacturers and some people are expecting that this might be the sensor that we could see on the pixel 6 pro previous leaks have said that google has used the imx 800 sensor for their pvt units but it might also be this new smartphone sensor that samsung is about to announce so either way pixel 6 pro is getting a huge camera hardware jump thanks to either sony or samsung so that's all the latest news the traditional smartphone is about to transform apple is aiming big and soon enough samsung will face the toughest competition but for now they're gonna move the industry and provide their oled panels to other smartphone brands let me know your thoughts in the comments section below with that being said i'll catch you guys later peace out [Music] does she have a [ __ ] wristband

[Music] [Music] [Music] yes hey what's up mkbhd here so the samsung galaxy s 21 is 200 cheaper than last year that's a big deal we're so used to the prices of phones going up and up and up year after year that when you do see a big jump down in price it's because there was a conscious decision made here to offer more value so basically every smartphone that's not the highest end thing they can make is fundamentally a balancing act to try to check just the right set of boxes and combine just the right set of features to appeal to the most buyers and that's especially if you're samsung because they've got this goal to be the default smartphone to keep their top spot top of mind but the customer is more educated than ever and so no pressure or anything but you got to check the right side of boxes or they'll switch on you so the galaxy s21 they've dropped this year i think checks all the most important boxes most people care about performance battery camera and the smart sacrifices they've made to get to drop the price by 200 bucks almost no one will notice will you so first of all let's just start with the big one the design i've said i think is nice it's actually grown on me i started with like i don't really hate it and then it went somewhere up to i kind of like it and now i think it's one of the best honestly if you're going to have a camera bump own it this phone looks good in gray looks even better in this purple and gold teddy fresh contrast combo and looks even better in an icon skin linked below of course but generally like i said in my s21 ultra review this purposeful design bringing the metal camera bump straight to the sides where it wraps around the rails that's nice that's nice that's a good call but this camera little plate here is the only piece of metal on the back of the phone the rest is plastic and you'd barely notice it's still coated in the same way with this like super fine smoothish texture still has the same sheen to it it is lighter when you're holding it than the glass phones the s21 plus and the s21 ultra but to be honest i'm way more focused on the smaller footprint than the weight this goes all the way down to a 6.2 inch display so you'd expect it to be decently light anyway and 6.2 inches by the way still plenty of screen it's a little bit smaller but it is a pretty big screen so the plastic definitely not something you immediately feel and go oh they did a bad job you'll barely notice so let's talk about that screen so there's a couple things going on here it's still a really great samsung display it's very bright and readable outdoors has great color and hdr cert it's perfectly flat even flatter at the edges than the slightly curved s21 ultra so i like this flatness a lot on this colorway you do get a little bit of the gold rails kind of peeking around the sides which can make it look a little bit cheaper ideally it's just like thin black bezels and then nothing that would look sleek but overall great display same great larger ultrasonic fingerprint reader as the ultra same size tiny selfie camera cut out even though it's a different selfie camera and there's no way you notice from watching this youtube video but they dropped the resolution from 1440p to 1080p but the reason most people won't notice is one it's still a pretty sharp display 1080p on 6.2 inches is up over 400 pixels per inch it's not like a bad pixel density but two last year in order to switch to 120 hertz you had to use the screen at 1080p and so you couldn't use 1440p and 120hz at the same time and that was kind of a bummer but samsung i guess ran the numbers did the research understood that most people liked the 120 hertz and would take 1080p for that every time so now we do is 1080p every time and it's 120 hertz now would it have been better if we could use both like we can on the ultra yeah but will most people even notice i don't think so there's also a couple of even smaller things missing no s pen support on the regular s21 like the ultra gat and the variable refresh rate goes from 48 hertz to 120 hertz instead of 10 to 120 hertz so very small differences that samsung has weighed against how much money they can save and whether people will notice or not i absolutely did not notice any difference in responsiveness or performance this phone has been a great performer and speaking of performance honestly this is the one area where they still did go super high end this phone has the same chip the snapdragon triple eight in this region and it's every bit as much of a performer as it is on the ultra it does have eight gigs of ram instead of 12 or 16 but i never found i noticed any hesitation or performance or worse multitasking where i was wishing i had all that ram back now they could have they could have gone with a lower end chip this the 7 series they could have put a snapdragon 765 g in this phone like a lot of others have in their phones at this price and it would have been yet another savings they could have made that we probably wouldn't have really noticed actively as a difference in performance but they didn't this is still the fastest chip in a phone so i really do appreciate that all the same capabilities from the ultra as far as software enabled by the chip they're all still here and i didn't notice a difference in ram i used it just like i used the ultra and i had no problems with lag or choppiness at all so throughout all of samsung's absolutely packed software you know the dozens of embedded one ui features and maximum customization it's definitely nice to have a smaller phone that still performs almost exactly like the bigger phone now these cameras on the back they're another area where you of course see a difference between this and the ultra the ultra we already knew was all about giving you the big numbers the ultra camera experience that's the focus of this phone on this phone i think they've done a great job balancing taking the features out of the ultra that most people probably won't need or even notice and there's actually one thing one thing that this phone does on cameras better than the ultra might not have known that see if you can guess that go ahead and pause this video go ahead and write down what you think this camera might do better than the ultra and then hit play we'll see if you were right so there's triple cameras on the back of the s21 and they are essentially the same cameras from the s20 the main camera there's an ultra wide and a 3x telephoto so no crazy 100x space zoom just a reasonable maximum of 30x but at the end of the day if you don't do a ton of huge zooms and you still have the same sort of zoom lock where you can zoom all the way into the end of the camera and it'll stabilize the software that's probably about as good as most people will need it's not quite as sharp at that range as the ultra but will you notice there's no laser autofocus here either although i found with the smaller sensor it still has no focus issues and then there's the same snapdragon triple 8 so all the same capabilities like single take mode 8k video the director's mode all that stuff is still here so what does it do better than the ultra well the one thing with the word ultra in it is the ultra wide camera here on the s21 it's actually a little bit wider than the ultra wide on the ultra you can see it labels it 0.5 x versus 0.6 x but it's a little noticeably wider actually didn't notice it before checking the numbers it's great also i just want to shout out samsung's portrait mode for getting consistently better and better over time this will be my hot take for this video but i think samsung's portrait mode is now the best portrait mode in any smartphone put it over the iphone put it over the pixel seriously impressive stuff so don't let the lack of holes in the back of the camera fool you this is still a very capable camera system the lack of laser autofocus the lack of zoom past 30x the lack of a macro mode built in i noticed them because i'm a camera nerd but most people won't actually miss that stuff it's a great camera and there's a couple other small things here there's a 4 000 milliamp hour battery which is of course a bit smaller than the 5 000 milliamp hours on the bigger one yes but it's still a big battery and it lasted all day getting five plus hours of screen on time no problem i i could kill it in a day if i'm hammering it all day with a lot of gps and a lot of screen on time but aside from that it's fine it's a no worry battery and there's no expandable storage but that's also gone from the entire lineup and so is mst which was this cool trick that let samsung phones use magnetic pulses to replicate credit card functionality so they could pay with stuff at terminals that don't support nfc some people are going to hate that this is gone but that's another bet samsung had to make that most people weren't using it those are like the two most sorely missed features for me and a lot of enthusiasts expandable storage and mst was super useful but the whole line dropped by 200 so there's gonna be stuff that they cut out and that's the calculus they made is okay that's not getting a whole ton of use we'll get those but at the end of the day i think samsung checked the right set of boxes with the s21 and it's also only 50 bucks to upgrade and double the storage to 256 gigs which is pretty important since you no longer have expandable storage and if you're taking lots of photos and 8k videos you might want that so that's another great calculus to make but overall this is no doubt the best bang for the buck in the lineup i think it's going to be super common early to compare the s21 to the ultra which is a lot of what i did in this video but this phone costs four hundred dollars more so when you compare this phone up against this competition which is a bunch of other phones sitting around six seven eight hundred bucks it's gonna compare pretty favorably it's gonna have the highest end chip it's gonna have one of the nicest screens great fingerprint reader great camera system and the stuff that's missing which is the stuff that samsung is hoping you probably won't care too much about or even notice i think they made the right calculations on so this is it this is the standard package i have no problem recommending this phone but i'm also very curious to see how the rest of the competition will be attacking s21 all year for the rest of 2021. it'll be fun either way that's been it definitely watch the s21 ultra video right by that like button if you haven't seen it already uh and that's that's pretty much it i'll catch you guys in the very next video see you later peace distribution smartphone on the around fifteen thousand price bracket on my expert banner fifteen thousand won the six plus sixty four gpu on the sixteen thousand five hundred in the price bracket uh number six

we believe in reducing waste and saving the planet and that the third time's the charm I mean it's called fan edition you must have a buttload of fans in there to keep it unmalted I'm sorry I've just been informed that there are no additional fans in the Samsung Fe but that's alright don't worry because we're only launching it in South Korea at North Korea besides we can't burn for that long because we've improved it with new safety features like a smaller fuel cell battery and everyone's favorite Fire Warden six-feet let's say hello a big speak board Bixi oh sorry sir aiya don't work too well in the english market yet um and younger say oh no no I got George in sar uh-huh Bigsby Oh what what are you doing I'm uh I'm consuming the battery there uh-huh well that's good oh geez um could

card game fun cards play with your friends and decide who is the funkier force Hello, and welcome to ‘Unbox and Discover’ During this special event, we will unbox new products inspired by you and share the ways they can now inspire you. At the First Look event in January, I described the practical steps Samsung is taking to protect the environment and develop future screens that everyone can enjoy. Since then, many of you sent us messages of support and encouragement. Learning that you share our values gave us great strength. Today, on this stage inspired by our Eco-Packaging, I’m here to tell you that our vision of Screens Everywhere, Screens for All is not just a slogan. We continue to expand your choices with a diverse range of products that will bring more joy into your lives. Recently, we all experienced major changes in our daily routines and became more distanced from one another, but despite the change our life went on. Now home is our main hub, where various aspects of daily life intersect and layer within a multifunctional space. The evolution towards this sort of dynamic,
“Omni-layered Home” has empowered people to shape their lives anew. And in these Omni-layered Homes, TVs have a more important part to play than ever before. As the industry leader,
we at Samsung are always rethinking, on a fundamental level,
the screen’s role and purpose. In 2015, we debuted The Serif and started a new category of Lifestyle screens. Since then, we invested countless hours of research and continually engaged with our consumers to introduce more original products to the category. Since our Lifestyle screens took off, we began witnessing a gradual change. Consumers no longer simply “watched TV.” They designed TV-centered spaces,
shared that space online, and even started trends linked to our screens. For the first time in this industry, we inspired a “Consumer Fandom,” and earned high praise and recognition
for our Lifestyle screens. Most importantly, we achieved our mission to develop screens that reflect people’s different tastes, values,
and changing lifestyles. These screens will bring real change to real lives as the center of their new Omni-layered homes. Of course, we don’t stop there. We are on a new journey to bring you unlimited possibilities and opportunities through cutting-edge screens like the Micro LED. The game-changing screen is now ready for your homes. Soon, more of our amazing screens will take their place in classrooms, on stages and billboards, and countless other spaces both in- and outdoors, turning your imagination into a sustainable reality. 2021 will be the year we finally emerge from a long tunnel. I believe that this year, we will regain hope and recover the everyday routines we lost. I also believe our screens will become your companion, to enrich your daily life. Please continue to follow us closely as Samsung pioneers meaningful innovations to create a better life and a better normal for all. And now let me introduce my colleague James Fishler to guide you on today’s tour. Thank you JH, and hello everyone! We’re so glad you could join us to see what Samsung has in store for 2021. Last year, people spent more time in their homes than ever before. Our homes became not just where we spent our time off, but where we worked and where our children learned. With more time at home, we saw TV sales rise dramatically— And what’s interesting is that we saw growth on both ends of the screen size spectrum. We’ve seen more interest in the 75 inch and above segment, as people seek out immersive experiences for their living rooms. But we’ve also seen people flock to smaller screens:
43 inches and below. As home renovation spending spiked, people wanted displays to fit their spaces
and newfound needs. At Samsung, we’re proud that our innovations to enhance the TV experience and improve everyday life went. from being a “nice to have” to a “need” Our leadership,
built on a foundation of listening to consumers, has allowed us to consistently deliver
groundbreaking products decade after decade. And be the number one global TV brand for 15 consecutive years. Today, we’re excited to share our vision for 2021 and how we’ll truly redefine the role of the TV through cutting-edge technology, beautiful design, and impactful partnerships. To talk about how our Lifestyle TVs reflect that vision, let’s turn it over to my colleague Grace Dolan! Thank you James! Today, people love to pursue experiences that reflect their unique passions. They want everything in their life to be customized and personalized —including their technology. We created the lifestyle TV category in the spirit of creating screens for everyone. And each of our Lifestyle TVs serves a different consumer with different priorities. Many of today’s consumers want their TVs to express their style. One lifestyle TV that lets them do that is the Frame. Since we introduced the Frame, the groundbreaking display that transforms your TV into a work of art, over a million people have brought it into their households. and this year, we’re making it fit even more seamlessly into any home. Let’s take a look at the 2021 edition of The Frame. The Frame reflects who you are and what you love. It was originally designed to help consumers customize what was once a big blank rectangle in their living room. This year, we’re offering new ways to customize the Frame itself. We’re inviting you, in effect, to make your own TV. You can choose between the Slim Fit Wall Mount, basic stand, and studio stand options. And now we offer a total of five bezel options, including new designs in White and Brick Red, and third party providers who are offering other options to fit your unique taste. We’re also offering a new way to display the 2021 Frame,
with My Shelf. It lets you create a tailored wall with personal touches to complement your screen and décor. Today, people are finding new ways
to make creative use of their home space, and My Shelf leans into that trend. My Shelf can be attached to the 55 inch, 65 inch,
and 75 inch Frame sizes, and you can choose from beige and white. After installing The Frame, you can subscribe to the Art Store to access over 1,400 works from world-class museums and galleries. This year, we’re introducing new partnerships to further enhance the Art Store. With NAVA Contemporary, we’re bringing original artwork inspired by nature right into your home. We’re also teaming up with Etsy to offer a wider range of visual choices, including hidden gems from unknown artists and a family-friendly collection that anyone can enjoy. Speaking of family, you can always upload your own photos for the most personalized display of all. And we’ve increased photo storage space from 500 megabytes in 2020 to 6 gigabytes in 2021, so you can store up to 1,200 photos all in UHD quality. Of course, The Frame is also an outstanding TV with exceptional QLED picture, immersive audio, and compatibility with our latest soundbars— including our minimalist S-Series soundbar designed to match the Lifestyle TV aesthetic. And this year,
we’ve made The Frame slimmer than ever —just 24.9 millimeters thick— about the same depth as an actual picture frame. I could go on about how beautiful the Frame looks, but it’s better just to show you. Now, if the Frame blends into your space, the Serif is a centerpiece that makes a bold statement. Since its launch,
The Serif has developed a fan following unlike anything we’ve seen in the TV industry— people love how its iconic design
allows them to express themselves. And it’s taken social media by storm. Speaking of social media, there’s an entire generation of consumers out there who use mobile devices more than anything else. This has literally changed the shape of content, with a flood of vertical videos optimized
for phones and tablets. At the same time, as families have spent more time at home watching TV, there’s more motivation
to bring mobile content to the big screen so everyone can enjoy it together. The Sero makes the transition
from watching content on your phone to your TV easy and elegant. It is the world’s first TV that rotates freely between vertical
and horizontal modes. Just tap your phone to the screen, and the Sero will mirror the content you’re viewing. And this year, for the first time,
it will support Apple Airplay2, in both horizontal and vertical mode, so you can easily share videos, music, photos and more from your Apple devices. We’re also excited to share that we’ve kicked off the global rollout of TikTok on Samsung TVs—and it will soon be available on The Sero, allowing for a seamless viewing experience in vertical mode. >From vertical to horizontal content, The Sero delivers it all with stunning QLED picture quality, and powerful sound from its built-in 4.1 channel audio. Our lifestyle lineup can also recreate experiences you love. Who doesn’t miss going to the movies— dimming the lights, grabbing some popcorn,
and being swept away in a great story. The Premiere brings that experience home. The Premiere represents the next stage in home cinema. Traditional beam projectors can be clunky to set up— they offer a big screen, but with resolution far below an ordinary TV. The Premiere offers a simple solution. Its minimalist design,
with rounded edges and a fabric finish, fits neatly into any home. We offer two models: the LSP7 and LSP9. I have the LSP9 right here. It is the very latest triple laser projector
boasting a 4k resolution. Each light source has its own red, green, and blue color, allowing for sharp, bright images. And you can project that clarity at a massive scale:
up to 130 inches. And, since it’s an ultra short throw projector, you can position it as little as 11 centimeters from the wall— less than the length of a typical remote control. >From there, you just need a white or monotone wall,
or an ALR screen, and then to kick back and enjoy. And soon, we’ll be offering rollable screens optimized for the Premiere on Samsung.com. Finally, a home theater can not exist without amazing sound. The Premiere boasts a 4.2 channel, 40 watt,
all-in-one sound system housing a woofer and tweeter, so it sounds as great as it looks. This is The Premiere. The Premiere can do almost anything
your Samsung Smart TV can do. Enjoy your favorite shows and movies, or tap your smartphone to The Premiere and mirror the content you’re watching. The Premiere lets you enjoy a theater-style experience from your home. But if you’d rather enjoy a screening under the stars, we’ve got you covered. Our lifestyle lineup has revolutionized how we watch TV. With The Terrace,
we’re now revolutionizing where you watch TV. Last year, the backyard became a sanctuary for a lot of people. With travel on hold, it was the closest thing that some of us had to a summer getaway. We introduced The Terrace,
our first outdoor TV, to take the full Samsung Smart TV experience
and bring it outdoors. And people loved it beyond our expectations. They love being able to enjoy excellent picture quality, audio, and smart features right in their backyards. And they’re able to do so worry-free, because it’s weather-resistant, with an IP55 rating to protect against water and dust. And I’m so excited to share that this yearthe future of the Terrace will be brighter than ever when we introduce our 75-inch Full Sun model
just in time for summer. Stunning picture quality. Smart features. Reliable durability. Great audio. The Terrace rounds out our lifestyle lineup— with every screen designed to reflect what consumers want, and how they live. As I mentioned earlier, last year brought major changes to the way that we live. Many of us worked from home;
our kids learned from home. And as our lifestyle lineup made home more comfortable and personalized, our Smart Displays made home more productive and entertaining. To share more about that vision, let me introduce my colleague, Harry Patz. Thank you, Grace! It’s true: many of us had to make adjustments last year. As part of that change,
we relied on monitors more than ever. A screen we might have simply used to shop online
or surf social media became critical to everyday life. So we listened to our consumers, and explored what they expected from monitors. Then we took what we learned to develop displays suited to every need and every passion. Since we’re talking passions,
let’s begin with gaming. I’d like to introduce Ann Kim, who leads our Monitor Marketing team here at Samsung. Welcome Ann. Thank you Harry! We’ve seen gaming technology make dramatic strides in recent years. To fully enjoy those advancements, you need a monitor that can live up to them. Our Odyssey G9 gaming monitor generated
a lot of buzz in 2020, but we wanted to further enhance that experience. In 2021, for the first time, we’re applying our exclusive Quantum Matrix Technology to our flagship gaming monitor. The result is our latest Odyssey G9: a monitor that combines the superb contrast of Quantum Mini LED(s) with excellent gaming specs to unlock the full power of next-gen gaming. For that truly immersive experience, you still have the 1000R curved shape of the Odyssey G9. Or, if you prefer a flat screen, we also have those— with the Odyssey G7, G5, and G3 series. Take a look at what one legendary gamer can do with the power of the Odyssey G9. Thanks, Faker! We can’t wait to see you rack up more wins. Back to you, Harry! Thank you Ann! Since life isn’t always all fun and games, Meet the Smart Monitor—our first “do it all screen.” It gives you the best of both worlds:
a monitor with Smart TV features that can help you stay productive when you need to be— and entertained when you need a break. The Smart Monitor lets you work hard, play more, and even learn better. Take a look. With the Smart Monitor,
it’s easy to get work done. Got a last minute e-mail but your laptop isn’t handy? Microsoft 365 can be accessed right from the monitor— no other device necessary. And if you left files scattered over different devices, you can easily reach them with PC on Monitor. This setup helps you work from home even without a PC. With Tap View,
simply tap your mobile device to the display to mirror it. Or, set up wireless Samsung DeX straight from your phone or tablet. With Airplay 2, you don’t even need a cable to connect a MacBook. Then, when you need a break from all the productivity, this unique display becomes your TV— complete with a remote. Use Samsung’s Smart TV apps like Netflix and YouTube and even TV Plus, with over 160 channels of free content. Can’t find something? Tell our voice assistant Bixby what you’re looking for— and you’ll be guided to what you need. Our “first do-it-all screen”
brings new meaning to “multi-tasking.” It’s a monitor packed with the useful features you expect from a Smart TV. The Smart Monitor is the perfect solution for those of us working remotely. When it comes to working and learning in a remote and hybrid environment, One challenge is capturing that spirit of productive collaboration. We thought about ways to recapture that energy when we developed Samsung’s Interactive Display Flip, a digital interactive whiteboard
you can write, draw, and edit on. It offers interactivity and collaboration while working from home,
or in the classroom, and while learning on a mobile device or computer. See your coworker’s or teacher’s presentation— as if you were there in person. It’s a new way of learning and working while staying safe. And now, on top of the 55, 65,
and 85 inch models we’ve already introduced, we’re adding a 75 inch model to improve the range of choices
for educators and professionals. With its low latency rate and advanced touch recognition, writing on the Flip combines the ease of putting pen to paper with all the creative advantages of using a digital touchscreen display. You’ve heard how our Lifestyle lineup
changes how we view our TVs. You’ve heard how our smart displays help you make the most of work, school, and play. Now, let me reintroduce Grace Dolan to talk about how Samsung is taking our flagship TVs to the next level. Thank you Harry. I’m so excited to talk about how we’ve broken new ground to deliver consumers a first-class TV experience. TV enthusiasts have long strived for true-to-life visuals. You achieve that by increasing contrast, enhancing color, enabling higher resolutions, and offering immersive design. It takes big technological leaps to deliver the incredible viewing experience our consumers demand. We’ve done that with our new Samsung Neo QLED lineup. We developed the world’s first Quantum Matrix Technology featuring quantum mini LEDs
one-fortieth the size of conventional LEDs. That lets us fill more LEDs on the screen, allowing for ultra-fine light control. The result? Less blooming and halos— and astonishing detail in bright and dark areas. And to deliver a picture this magnificent, we built an exclusive engine:
our Neo Quantum Processor. On our 8K models, it uses improved AI-based algorithms and 16 multi-neural networks to upscale content to pristine 8K more accurately than we’ve ever done before. And you’ll have no shortage of content to watch, because our smart TV platform offers a wealth of entertainment options from the best in the biz: like HBO! Here’s a peek at what we have to offer. Hey everyone! I’m excited to join you today to speak about WarnerMedia’s partnership with Samsung for HBO Max. So Samsung was a launch partner when HBO Max debuted in the US last year, and has made the platform available to millions of customers via their living room TVs. Thanks to Samsung’s Universal Guide, it’s now easier than ever to discover HBO content on your Samsung Smart TV. Just use your voice, and find your favorite movies and TV shows. Or you can allow the Samsung’s Universal Guide to recommend the most popular HBO titles. With HBO Max you can enjoy all the HBO content you love, plus favorites from Cartoon Network,
TCM, Adult Swim, Studio Ghibli, and so much more. Best of all, throughout 2021, US consumers can watch all of Warner Brother’s theatrical releases, as they premiere in theaters on the same day on HBO Max. And do it on your massive 85 inch Neo QLED screen from the comfort and safety of your living room. And later this spring these stories will be available in HDR 10 playback. HBO Max is already a hit with audiences in the US, and we will expand into more countries soon. We look forward to developing our partnership with Samsung to bring a curated collection of incredible stories from the world’s best storytellers directly to our fans. Beyond picture quality, Samsung Neo QLED redefines the role TV plays in your life. Last year especially, people turned to TVs as an outlet for their passions— and we have developed services and features to enhance those experiences. For example: people have flocked to gaming to pass time at home. One 2020 study found that four out of every five consumers self-identify as gamers! Our Samsung Neo QLED line offers cutting-edge capabilities to level up the TV gaming experience. To help players quickly monitor critical aspects of play, we’ve introduced our Game Bar. It includes our Super Ultrawide Gameview feature, which allows gamers to play at the wide 21:9 aspect ratio, and even the ultra-immersive 32:9 ratio. And we’ve incorporated new features to boost your gameplay. With 12-bit backlight control, you’ll see every detail—even in the dark. With input lag as low as 5.8 milliseconds, you won’t miss a thing. Our dynamic Object Tracking Sound feature will immerse you in the action as sound is projected to follow the objects on screen. And our Motion Xcelerator Turbo+ feature means you’ll enjoy any next-gen game in smooth, seamless quality. And speaking of next-gen experiences, we’re thrilled that Samsung QLED is joining forces with Xbox once again, this time as the official TV Partner of Xbox Series X in the United States and Canada— continuing years of partnership with Microsoft. Starting with true native 4K gaming with Xbox One X, we advanced features like VRR and Auto Game Mode to make TV gaming seamless. We were fully optimized the day Xbox Series X launched, and we’ll remain at the forefront with our exciting new Neo QLED line up. Together, Xbox and Samsung will push the boundaries of next gen gaming. This year, we’ve also partnered with AMD to develop the first TV with Freesync Premium Pro support for both PC and console games. It delivers a truly exceptional HDR gaming experience. Let’s take a look. Hello. I’m excited to join you for this special event. AMD and Samsung have a great history of partnership Now we are very excited that Samsung has the industry’s first AMD FreeSync Premium Pro certified TV. FreeSync Premium Pro technology works amazingly well with Samsung Neo QLED, where we can meet, even exceed, the growing demand for high-fidelity gaming experiences. FreeSync Premium Pro delivers uncompromised high performance gaming with stunning HDR fidelity. For the first time in a TV, we’re enabling FreeSync Premium Pro with low latency HDR. It’s possible with our tear-free,
stutter-free FreeSync Premium Pro technology, on Samsung TVs. We will continue to pursue our partnership while you go out there and have fun! Thanks for having me. Gaming isn’t the only passion people enjoyed on their TVs in 2020. When gyms closed last year, people started searching for ways to stay fit at home. Around that time, we launched Samsung Health, a comprehensive fitness and mindfulness platform that gave people the ability to work out or meditate in their living rooms with content from our partners like barre3, Calm, Fitplan,
and Jillian Michaels Fitness. This year, we’re upgrading Samsung Health with an AI-based Smart Trainer. Connect an optional external camera to your TV,
and Smart Trainer will use AI to analyze your posture and give real-time feedback as you follow along with instructional videos. We also know that wellness means more than just physical health. It involves the peace of mind you get reconnecting with loved ones and building new relationships—and people are increasingly relying on videochat apps to make that possible. So with Google Duo, you can initiate a high-quality, high-speed video call from your compatible TV — take a call with up to 32 people, or enjoy a 1-on-1 conversation with someone as though they were actually there. Hey guys! With a supported Logitech USB camera, it will automatically adjust to ensure you’re in focus. Then there’s Multi View. Simply select a layout. Then sit back and enjoy a multi screen experience, all together on your Neo QLED. You can also control what you see and hear. >From how the screen is divided to the volume in each section, It’s fully customizable. The Samsung Neo QLED 8K lineup features a revolutionary Infinity One design that removes every distraction so you can focus on the viewing experience. Unlike the thick frame surrounding a conventional screen, the Neo QLED bezel is dramatically slimmed down to a tiny 0.8 millimeters— to immerse you fully in your favorite content. And its beautiful metallic grill includes thousands of pin-sized holes that maximize sound from its 16 speaker units. Plus, the Attachable Slim One Connect
makes cable clutter a thing of the past. To address the rising demand for consumer choice, the Samsung Neo QLED lineup comes in a variety of models and sizes— from ultra-large centerpieces to smaller screens for smaller spaces. Our 8K models, QN800A and QN900A, are available in 65 inch, 75 inch, and 85 inch sizes. And our 4K QN90A and QN85A models have an even wider selection, starting at 50 inches. The bottom line: there’s a Samsung Neo QLED for every room and passion. All of these models are available right now at retail or on Samsung.com. Now, I’d like to welcome back James Fishler to talk about how we’re meeting consumers’ demand for immersive experiences—in both sight and sound. Thanks, Grace! Every Samsung TV features high performance audio built-in. But a top-tier soundbar can elevate the experience to something magical. At our Audio Lab in California, our researchers constantly work to deliver audio experiences that live up to our awe-inspiring screens. Let’s take a look inside the lab. My name is Allan Devantier, I’m in charge of the Audio Lab in U.S. If I would describe Samsung sound in one word,
that would be “true”. We want to cultivate a very neutralized sound platform to deliver artists’ true intention. How do we test the product? How do we make a product really that is consumer centric? We want to delight the customer, make them say wow everytime they see something. So you know what? Look forward to 2021, because we’re going to be bringing fantastic technologies to you. Since 2016, we’ve also collaborated with Dolby to deliver realistic, three-dimensional sound experiences. Now, we’re collaborating to produce exclusive content promoting the power of Dolby Atmos Sound. For more on this collaboration, here’s John Couling from Dolby Labs. Hello everyone. I’d like to first start by thanking Samsung for inviting me to speak with you. It’s great to be a part of this exciting event. Samsung has been a long and valued Dolby audio partner. Together we have enabled transformative entertainment experiences for millions of consumers around the world. Through our collaborative partnership, we continue to set high standards for next-generation home entertainment through our expertise in immersive experiences combined with Samsung’s leadership in innovative hardware. Today, I’d like to speak with you about how we are pushing the boundaries of home audio with Samsung’s latest Dolby Atmos soundbars. Dolby Atmos is an innovative audio technology powering the world’s top films,
streaming series, video games, music, and live sports. It transforms entertainment through moving audio that moves around a listener in an immersive soundscape. By removing the restrictions caused by audio channels and speaker set-ups, Dolby Atmos allows creatives to put sound anywhere they want. Now they can place listeners inside their stories – allowing them to feel like they are in the center of the action. This is a perfect match for Samsung’s 2021 soundbar lineup, which leverages an innovative design that will deliver a truly impressive audio experience that takes immersive sound to the next level. And to celebrate this new lineup,
Samsung and Dolby work together to produce next exclusive Dolby Atmos demo clip that will showcase the full capabilities of these devices. We look forward to continuing to expand our partnership with Samsung to bring incredible home entertainment
to more consumers around the world. And we look forward to you having the opportunity to enjoy these amazing soundbars firsthand. Thank you. Thanks, John! Immersive, powerful audio is essential to creating a cinematic experience. And just as we did with Neo QLED, we’ve broken technological barriers for our soundbars to deliver. Our Q950A soundbar is the world’s first with true 11.1.4 channel sound— the largest number of channels available in a Samsung soundbar. It’s packed with 21 custom-designed speakers to amplify every nuance. Plus, every soundbar in Samsung’s Q-series lineup has both Dolby ATMOS and DTS:X support —offering true-to-life sound. And the 9500S, our new wireless rear speaker kit, adds even greater depth to the listening experience. But Samsung soundbars truly stand out when paired with 2021 Samsung TVs. We’ve developed exclusive Q-Symphony technology that syncs up the audio from the Samsung TV and soundbar to deliver enhanced 3D surround sound unlike any other experience. Finally, to let people effortlessly customize their home sound setup, our Q Series also offers SpaceFit Sound, which uses the sound sensor at the bottom of the TV to analyze the surrounding environment and delivers sound optimized for the room it’s in. We design our soundbars with the same philosophy as our displays: creating a breadth of options catering to every consumer. >From those who want a bold design statement, to those demanding the pinnacle of technology and luxury. Which leads me…to MICRO LED. MICRO LED is a revolutionary innovation opening new possibilities. Unlike any other screen, MICRO LED offers the ultimate viewing experience, with superb brightness, deep blacks, and breathtaking image quality. It’s jaw-dropping. It represents the future of screens. And it makes a massive statement in any home. We introduced our plans for MICRO LED in 2018 with “The Wall.” Just three years later, thanks to groundbreaking production innovations, MICRO LED is now ready for your home. We’ll be rolling out MICRO LED globally beginning at the end of March, starting with the 110 inch and 99 inch sizes. The 88 inch size is coming this fall, and we’re excited to announce that a 76 inch size is on the future roadmap —so consumers can find the right fit for their living room. Despite its minimalist design, MICRO LED offers immersive audio through its majestic Arena Sound system. And its massive scale unlocks unparalleled experiences. Take the Quad View feature. You can comfortably watch up to four sources of content simultaneously— keep up with multiple sports at once, or stream a walkthrough while playing a video game, all in stunning quality and size. Simply put, MICRO LED gives you more. Unreal picture quality at an enormous scale. New viewing experiences. And clear, resonant audio right out of the box. You’ve seen the sheer range of screens we have to offer— from our lifestyle TVs all the way to the aspirational technology of MICRO LED. But this year, we’re not just offering more choices— we’re redefining the role of TV. As JH Han said today and at First Look, we’re committed to developing screens everyone can enjoy. That means enhancing our technology to ensure all users can enjoy the experience: like introducing a sign language zoom feature so interpreters can be better seen and understood, and creating an application that ensures colorblind viewers get an optimized viewing experience. Better serving our consumers also means better serving the environment. Our eco-friendly packaging encourages upcycling, and we’re packaging a solar cell-powered Remote Control with all of our Samsung Neo QLEDs, our MICRO LED line, and the Frame— multiplying its impact across millions of homes. >From the unprecedented breadth of our Smart TV lineup, to our efforts to promote accessibility and sustainability, Samsung is committed to creating innovative screens anyone can enjoy for years to come. That’s exactly how we’re living up to our ongoing vision of Screens Everywhere, and Screens for All. Thank you!

and then this Samsung Galaxy S21 it's been out for   a while and it's a flagship of course from them 
and i wanted to compare both of these flagships   to find out if the Realme GT is really a flagship 
killer it does sell for a very good price here   currently at the time of this video under 400 
euros versus the about 600 euros to pick up a   Galaxy S21 here in europe so this is obviously 
being the european version the exynos 2100 model   this has the snapdragon triple eight both have 
eight gigabytes of ram both of them 128 gigabytes   of ufs 3.1 storage we have a 4000 milliamp 
hour battery with the samsung versus a 4500   65 watt fast charging versus 25 watt charging 
and some other big differences that i will go   over in this in-depth comparison to find out 
the differences between the Realme GT and the   Galaxy S21 then inside the box what is included 
with Realme we get a 65 watt charger which fully   charges the phone and they claim 35 minutes 
my testing it's more like 39 minutes but it's   really really fast and we get a type c to type 
t cable tpu case is included and then samsung   wow it's a tiny box because it does not include 
a charger at all we get just a type c to type c   cable and then the included paperwork 
that's it if you want a case if you need   a charger the type c charger you have to 
pay additional and buy those accessories   so the difference of weight here with them we 
have about 185 grams versus about 171 here with   the samsung the size difference obviously 
because the smaller screen on the samsung   6.2 inches versus 6.43 thickness wise there is a 
bit of a difference here as well we are looking at   about 8.5 millimeters according to my measurements 
versus then about eight with the samsung so   there's not too much in it there but the plastic 
that is used on the back of the samsung it does   pick up a lot of fingerprints and because we have 
this fake leather style uh which is quite nice   it's a synthetic material here with the Realme it 
doesn't pick up any fingerprints but this plastic   strip here does okay that's glossy it will be easy 
to scratch we've got our camera module right there   and with the camera module here on the samsung 
this one has alloy around it now the frame around   the outside of the samsung and the buttons 
are metal and in hand it actually to me feels   a little better i like the size of it the 6.2 is 
quite nice to be a slightly smaller phone and the   lighter weight to it as well you do notice 
slightly there being about 15 grams lighter   now with the Realme here frame around the outside 
it looks like it's metal but trust me it is not   okay it's plastic all around the outside of this 
one and then with the ports are looking at the   bottom of both of these phones here type c port 
on the roma GT is just usb 2 speed sadly which for   flagship that's a little slow but we have usb 3.1 
speed so the faster port here with the samsung but   it also has another edge and that is it supports 
video out out of this port their desktop mode so   we've got the two downwards firing loudspeakers 
both of these models here have loudspeakers on the   with the earpiece as well and then 3.5 millimeter 
on the Realme GT this is something i still love   to have in my phones and great to see that it is 
there now akg tune sound with samsung and then   when we take a look at the top here we do have a 
secondary microphone and there's an additional two   there with the samsung you can see the antenna 
lines here obviously with the plastic frame it   doesn't need the gap in the middle for the antenna 
line that's why the Realme does not have it so the   earpieces they're located in the top just here now 
there's a tiny little gap with the samsung for the   earpiece and here we've got like the grille too 
with the Realme so you can just see that there   and then our fingerprint readers so these ones are 
always on capacitive and both of them both of them   are very very quick so on the Realme it takes 
you can see like a second and with the samsung   just gonna tap there to wake it up it's about 
the same it is very very quick there okay so   they both unlock i would have to say really about 
equal speeds to me to my eyes they are very very   quick both of them with the animations i'll just 
do that Realme again okay that was a quick tap so   yeah they're excellent now both of them also have 
face unlocking too from their front facing cameras   now when you look at the bezels on these displays 
that the chin is clearly smaller here on the S21   now the GT a little bit more of a chin and 
the left and right bezels you can see that   slightly thicker on the realme GT there too now i 
do prefer the more symmetrical in the middle here   centered front facing 10 megapixel camera there 
with the Galaxy S21 and in the corner here this   one's 16 megapixels with the Realme GT now 
the rear of them looking at their cameras   there will be a camera comparison in this index 
comparison but we have a main 64 megapixel camera   we've got an 8 megapixel ultra wide and a 2 
megapixel macro with the Realme GT here samsung   they step it up a little bit more here we've got 
a 12 megapixel ultra wide 64 megapixel zoom camera   which is three times and that's mostly actually 
digital to get that three times and then a main   12 megapixel sensor that one has optical image 
stabilization uh the cameras on the real meat   none of them have any optical image stabilization 
they just use electronic with the displays as i   mentioned we have 6.2 inches versus 6.43 so a 
slight difference it's slightly larger there's   not really that much in it now they're both very 
bright screens so on the Realme i measure around   about 780 nets on this model here that i have and 
then about close to almost 900 about 881 nits here   with the Samsung Galaxy S21 so it's a slightly 
brighter screen so therefore a more superior   screen there so 120 hertz on both of them both 
have the same resolution of 1080 by 2400 maximum   and they are really good screens so you can't 
go wrong with either of them here but if you   use your phone a lot in direct sunlight the 
samsung can boost all the way up to 1300 nits   just to point out too that both of these phones 
they take dual nano sims 5g support both run   android 11 both have nfc support both of them 
also have eight gigabytes of ram ufs 3.1 storage   both 128 gigabytes but there's a difference here 
while they're running android 11 of course we do   have samsung's own one ui 3.1 with this a lot of 
features on there and animations seem to be very   smooth it's very fluid and then with the Realme GT 
here we have their Realme ui 2.0 so that banding   you're seeing on camera that's because there's 
no dc dimming coming through on these displays   a little bit so both of them feel very very quick 
here now i think the edge would actually go to the   realme GT here in terms of the ui performance it 
just seems a little quicker to me why is that well   i've discovered that the animations definitely 
seem to be a lot quicker now this is out of the   box okay i'm not tweaking anything with developer 
settings i'm not changing animations it just seems   that with the room ui it's a little quicker there 
and very very quick performance i raw loading apps   and everything so i won't do any of those silly 
speed tests because we have a difference in chip   sets here of course snapdragon triple eight and 
then the exynos 2100 with the samsung why do i   not have the same chipset well that's because this 
one is the european version the only version i can   get locally otherwise i would love to compare 
snapdragon 8 versus snapdragon 8 of course   when you get both of these phones out of the 
box you will find quite a bit of pre-installed   bloatware now the samsung had the least amount 
of bloatware in the beginning but there was a   firmware update that came through and it had 
it more bloatware as you can see i removed   some things and then some more bloke came through 
like ticktop and whatnot and we've got facebook   and linkedin and a few other bloatware apps 
on the Realme as well so for flagships they   shouldn't really have this kind of bloatware 
present because after all we're playing for   a flagship it shouldn't be putting these well 
these pre-installed apps on there but it's not   too hard to remove them of course i just want to 
point that out so big difference in the chipset   performance and i have seen this and done real 
world tests before in the past that the exynos   to me the 2100 is an inferior chip compared to the 
snapdragon triple eight not only in benchmarks but   later on in real world use and gaming especially 
you do actually notice these kind of slight   differences once you've used both of the phones 
and you swap between them so on the cpu side it's   not too bad but you can see the gap there with 
the gpu is huge now that's a massive difference   there the gpu scores or when it comes to gaming 
performance as mentioned you will actually see   that so here the internal storage on both of them 
ufs 3.1 and they are both very quick the samsung   has a slight advantage there on the sequential 
speeds and some of the randoms there but i mean   both of them are really really quick here so 
you can almost say that's about a tie there but   the sequentials writes a little bit faster 
there on the samsung so it does have the faster   storage there too so wildlife this is a 
3d stress test and well as expected the   snapdragon 8 does better here doesn't it slightly 
higher score here slightly better average frames   rate average frame rate so if you're worried 
about your gaming performance you're really into   your games you want the best gaming performance 
and you're not too fussed about say the cameras   then i would definitely go with the GT because of 
that and you'll see later on when i do the little   gaming test so wireless performance here now 
something was going on with my router but hey   both phones were connected up to the router and 
they both didn't do well at all for maximum speeds   however i did find that Realme GT with my router 
seems to be overheating at the moment with summer   temperatures it still managed to get a faster 
speed there lower faster speed at the point   downstairs versus this samsung so if wireless 
performance you must have the absolute top best   download speeds for wireless performance then 
i think the GT definitely does perform a little   bit better there now gps different head different 
chipset manufacturers of course here however look   at the difference on the amount of satellites 
that the qualcomm sees it gets an accuracy of   three meters the x and s gets an accuracy of 
four but look at the average signal strength   is very important to look at it's actually 
better on the exynos here now walking around   i found that to me it looked like even though 
the accuracy doesn't look as good here that the   exynos was doing a slightly better job at times 
probably because of the average signal strength   although the sheer number of gps satellites 
that it locks onto is impressive on the GT   on to our audio quality now so we've got 3.5 
millimeter jack support here with the GT which   is great to have and then the S21 well you 
have to use a type-c adapter with that one   now the quality out of it does then sound actually 
when using the digital to analog with the samsung   sounds better to me however the loudspeaker 
now the loudspeakers on these were akg tuned   so coming out of the bottom on both of them then 
out of the earpiece i do actually find the Realme   GT to be slightly louder and to my ears actually 
a little bit better than the samsung so for the   headphone users out there using type c the samsung 
gets the win but for the loudspeakers the GT gets   a win and i'll play both of them now the same 
track at 100 volume and you can hear for yourself now with gaming performance it is very similar 
however with the game like pub g there is a   difference with the graphic settings that pubg 
will allow so this is the samsung at the top   anything but smooth and it will not allow us 
to have the extreme frame rate option which   is the one we want however with the Realme 
GT look at this we can use balanced and hd   all with the extreme frame rate option so you can 
get the higher looking better graphics now we'll   set them both here just to smooth and that will 
give us the best frame rate there and we'll take   a look at some of the gameplay and what you can 
expect now when looking at the performance in game   here it feels very very similar but i've noticed 
that when i scroll around like really really fast   it should come through on camera that it actually 
does seem to look a lot and feel a lot smoother on   the Realme GT so reflecting what we're also seeing 
with the synthetic benchmarks coming through with   gaming performance that even on the smooth setting 
here just looking around that's what the Galaxy   S21 and again with the Realme it just does seem to 
be a little bit smoother there and you can check   on that frame rate of course bringing up the game 
center here and you can see that it's a constant   60 frames per second well 59 frames per second and 
with the samsung i believe it is almost exactly   the same but just sometimes looking around it 
may lose just a couple of frames there but it is   a flagship phone still both of them have flagship 
gaming performance just i feel the edge definitely   goes to the realme GT in gaming performance and 
now our battery life so of course we've got a 500   milliamp hour difference here this has a larger 
battery the Realme GT 4500 milliamp hours versus   4 000 now both of them were calibrated to 200 nits 
both at 120 hertz and this is the difference so   almost an hour and a half sorry two hours and 
a half difference you're looking around about   six to seven hours of on-screen time that is 120 
hertz and around then about eight hours maximum on   screen time so the difference is really only about 
real world use here again of about 45 minutes more   additional time at 120 hertz that is you'll 
be able to get out of the Realme GT now this   one charges faster of course so it took about 40 
minutes it's 39 to 40 minutes to fully charge at   65 watts versus 1 hour and 11 minutes at 25 watts 
with the Samsung Galaxy S21 which is a lot slower   moving over to our cameras now i do believe 
that the samsung S21 has the edge here with   better video quality better photo quality as you 
will see between but for these that i'm comparing   now this is front facing video from the 10 
megapixel camera on the samsung we can shoot   up to 4k 60 and with the Realme GT we only 
have 1080p now both of them do have very   good electronic image stabilization but a clear 
advantage here with the resolution on the samsung   i'll swap over to the rear cameras now ultra wide 
now so they both have another difference here   with the resolutions at 1080p maximum with the 
ultra wide on the Realme GT's camera and again   the samsung can shoot 4k 30 and 4k60 with its 
ultra wide camera so it has a clear advantage   here with the video performance just capturing 
more detail so jog ahead slightly we can see now   that electronic image stabilization working main 
cameras now so 12 megapixels with the optical   image stabilization phase detection autofocus 
with the samsung and with the Realme GT it is a   64 megapixel sensor that doesn't have any optical 
image stabilization so it's all electronic now   stability on both of them looks very good but at 
times i think the GT here with 4k footage now 4k30   does look a little more stable looking there 
at the castle now you can apply zoom digital   zoom on both of these to zoom a little 
bit closer so just do a little bit here   so that says 1.5 and 1.6 here 1.5 again on both 
of them there and just a short little jog ahead   that is when you notice that 
then the samsung S21 Galaxy   S21 is looking a lot better when you move around 
a lot it doesn't tend to shake around as bad all right so keep it simple here with a recap 
better cameras slightly better build quality   slightly better screen video out ip rating 
wireless charging that is the reason then to go   for the Galaxy S21 but if you want to have better 
gaming performance slightly better battery life   i'm not talking a lot only about 35 45 minutes 
more of on-screen time you'll be able to get out   of the realme GT versus the Galaxy S21 which is 
not huge but because 120 hertz is a huge taxing   a refresh rate on any kind of phone it burns 
for it quite quickly but the better battery   life gaming performance and the snapdragon 
triple eight clearly to me is superior   to the exynos 2100 it is a slightly inferior 
chip and i just don't really think it is flagship   performance and you see it everywhere it's a fast 
phone don't get me wrong it's just when you game   and other things like synthetic benchmarks 
you do notice the differences there that   yeah this one definitely performs a lot better so 
we have the 65 watt fast charging and that's very   quick so only about 35 to 40 minutes in my testing 
it's 40 minutes and this one will take about an   hour and 10 minutes so a lot slower samsung's 
falling behind on their charging rates definitely   they need to pick that up in 2021 and the other 
thing with this of course the big factor is if   you're on a budget but you want a flagship then 
clearly this one is so much cheaper you're looking   at around 600 or so euros versus around 380 370 
with coupons and things from aliexpress at the   time of this video that is to get the Realme GT 
so thank you so much for watching this comparison   between these two flagships did you agree with my 
findings if you didn't let me know in the comments   and do like and subscribe if you want to see 
more up and coming videos just like this one [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] video So last week, you guys saw
my Samsung Galaxy A52 unboxing and first impressions. But this time guys,
for the Samsung Galaxy A72, this will already be
my unboxing and review video. Hey guys. 
It's your Tech Girl, Mary! And welcome back to my channel. I know you're looking forward
to this smartphone, especially for the
Samsung Galaxy A71 users that wants to upgrade
to the Samsung Galaxy A72. I know that the Samsung A series
right now is so hyped. And one of the reasons
is the availability of its colors. But guys, you know,
the Samsung Galaxy A series is not the only new release
that is in the Php20,000 range, because we still have smartphones that were released last week
like the POCO F3. We also have a more affordable
which is the POCO X3 Pro. There is also the new 
Redmi Note 10 Pro, but it's not available
here in the Philippines "officially". So I can say that the population
of the mid-range devices are really oversaturated. It's now "population", right? But guys, more releases
means good news, because of course
there's more choices. But it's also bad news
to some people, because it's really harder
to choose what's really worth upgrading. But come to think of it,
I know that competition is good, but I can't help to think
that the new smartphones are kind of the same.
It's like... Is there nothing new? You'll be thinking that
is it still worth it to upgrade smartphone right now,
especially with the situation of our country as of now? Anyway, those are my two cents. Forgive me that we went off topic. So let us now unbox
the Samsung Galaxy A72. (entertainment music) This Samsung Galaxy A72,
its price in the market right now is Php23,990
and that is for the 8GB of RAM with 256GB of internal storage. We have a small box. Actually, let's do this fast
since the inside of this is just the same
with the Samsung Galaxy A52. SIM tool or our poking tool. Samsung Care Plus,
quick start guide, and its warranty card. Clear jelly case
unlike that tinted jelly case that we have 
in the Samsung Galaxy A52. We have the phone 
in awesome white. Type-C charging cable. And a fast charging power brick
from Samsung. (entertainment music) On the Samsung Galaxy A52...
Actually, same colors are available 
on the Samsung Galaxy A52 except that we have
the awesome purple. It's just not that the purple
is not available when I bought one in the mall. Awesome white looks very clean, and the colors of the back
is the same with its camera bump making it seem like
it doesn't have a camera bump, even though it really has one once you've held it sideways. It's still the same with the A52 where it's soft matte finish
which I really like. This is one of my favorites
that we have on the new A series of Samsung. Although it's definitely
a lot heavier. Guys, it weighs 203g. Of course, our display 
on this one is bigger. And if you want 
a weight comparison, the Samsung Galaxy A52
and the 5G version of that only weighs 189g. Let's have a quick phone tour.
On the top it has a secondary microphone,
a SIM tray. And same with the 
Samsung Galaxy A52 guys, it's not triple SIM tray,
because it's either you use the dual SIM
or you use only one SIM and the expandable card
is the other one. It's not triple slot.
In here guys, you can only put two SIM card or one SIM card
with a microSD card up to 1TB. That's what made this good guys,
it's can handle up to 1TB like with the A52 and A52 5G. It has a volume rocker
on the right side, power button below,
a headphone jack, another microphone,
USB Type-C port, and its speaker grill. Maybe if the Samsung Galaxy A72
would have an advantage against competitors
that are also recently released, or not even this one
but the A52 and A52 5G, is its design. Actually, the available colors
that we have are very youthful that other brands can't offer. I'm glad that Samsung
is now offering trendy color choices like this awesome white and the awesome blue
that you saw in the A52. It's still plastic,
but I don't have a problem if it's plastic. And as what you guys saw
from the A52, it still has an IP67 water and dust resistance. (entertainment music) Now for the display. Actually, for the display size,
it's still the same from its predecessor
that is the A71. It supports 2400x1080 resolution
that has 394 PPI which is overall a really good
resolution for the price that you paid. It also has Super AMOLED+ screen which is why its blacks
are very deep and rich. Even though its blacks 
are very deep guys, it's not oversaturated. And overall, for me,
the screen quality is really excellent
as expected from Samsung. Same with the Samsung Galaxy A52, we have 90Hz 
screen refresh rate here. Another upgrade 
from its predecessor. But, maybe they could have 
gone with 120Hz just to have, you know,
a good reason for you to upgrade or at least
have a separation between A52 and A72 
in terms of display. Their only difference
is really the size. That's it. Aside from its beautiful display,
guys, like with the A52, its side bezels also improved. It's thinner than 
its predecessor, the A71. And, I also think
that the punch hole became smaller, so it looks more premium-looking. But this phone guys,
you cannot dynamically adjust the screen refresh rate
based on content. But this is what I've noticed
based on my usage from the past few days. The touch response
of the A72 is very good compared to A52. Another thing, the in-display sensor
is faster on the A72 than on the Samsung Galaxy A52. But if you'll ask me,
I'll still prefer having a side-mounted fingerprint sensor. Aside from that, it also has a SGS certified eye comfort feature that really helped me
to have a non-fatiguing experience at night. Aside from that, 
like with the A52, it also has 
a Widevine L1 certification. So when I tried it
in watching HD content on Netflix, it's more enjoyable. (entertainment music) How about the speakers?
Actually, stereo speakers setup is what we have on the A72. The audio quality is good for me. I appreciate that we have
a stereo speakers setup here. Definitely a lot better
and it's more enjoyable when playing or watching. But, I can't say that 
its sound quality is so good. Basically, for audio,
it's just okay. (entertainment music) Now, let's go 
to the gaming performance of the A72 or how good
is the chipset used on it. For the Samsung Galaxy A72, it has the Qualcomm 
Snapdragon 720G with Adreno 618 GPU. And I'll just repeat this,
we have 8GB of RAM. Now, if you want 
a very quick comparison on the chipset that is used
on the Samsung Galaxy A52 5G 5G, that one already has
a Qualcomm Snapdragon 750G. Then, its GPU is also
more improved with the Adreno 619. Anyway, they both have
an 8nm chip. It's just that for the price
of Php23,990, it's hard to accept
that it's not 5G ready. If you're looking for a phone
that's futureproof already and you don't frequently upgrade, wherein it's every 3 years
or every 4 years before you buy another phone, I highly encourage you guys
to buy a phone that is 5G ready. And if we'll compare its price
to the A52 5G, they're the same. It's so hard guys, right?
It's hard to choose what to buy. Actually, for its AnTuTu score,
its result is 289,233. It's high, but it's not high
for the price that you paid for it. There are phones
that are recently released that have exceeded 500,000
AnTuTu score and also below Php20,000. And we were to translate it
in real life, gaming was fun and okay. There are some frame drops,
but it's not so noticeable, but if you'll play Genshin Impact,
it's not that smooth especially if you prefer
high graphic settings. Actually, the chipset that we have on the Samsung Galaxy A52 5G 
is higher. I'm just not sure
what the AnTuTu score of that is and what kind of performance
it'll give me. Of course, in my case,
it doesn't matter that much. But on paper, where specs 
will be our basis, 720G versus a phone
that has a 750G chipset, I'm pretty sure they have
a big difference in terms of performance. That's if you prefer a smartphone
that has a smaller display and has a smaller 
battery capacity. (entertainment music) Now for the battery. This Samsung Galaxy A52
has 5,000mAh battery capacity. It has the biggest battery capacity
among the A series that were released
this 2021 here in the Philippines. And it's also capable
of fast charging 25W power brick. And good news, 
the power brick that's included inside the box is already 25W. Just not sure about 
the Samsung Galaxy A52 5G if its box already includes
a 25W power brick. And to compare it,
4,500mAh is also only the battery capacity of the A52 5G. Based on experience,
the A72 can really last up to 1 1/2 day. And knowing that 
it doesn't have 5G, the battery will last even longer. On charging, the 25W 
is a huge help, because I didn't charge it
for so long. It didn't exceed 1 1/2 hour. Only 30 minutes have passed
and it gave 40% of juice already. But if you'll ask me,
you know guys, I really want the Samsung A52 5G. The only thing is that
awesome black is the only color that we have for that. But if you'll ask me,
its black is very similar to the S21 Ultra. It's not exactly the same,
but you know, it's like a plastic version
of the S21 Ultra. (entertainment music) Now, let's go to cameras. Actually, for the cameras,
this is where someone will win. This is where the A72 shines. It has 64MP main camera,
8MP telephoto lens, 12MP ultrawide, and 12MP macro lens. For its front camera,
it has a 32MP. So if you heard that,
yes, we have a dedicated telephoto lens
for the Samsung Galaxy A72. And by the way, the primary camera
of the A72 is the same with the A52 that has already OIS. And its 8MP telephoto lens guys,
it's also capable of 3x optical zoom.
And good news, it also has OIS. Looking at the shots
that I captured, I can really say
that's set of cameras that we have for the 
Samsung Galaxy A72 is promising. Actually, this is where
they'll differ. The result of the colors
are very good, especially the utlrawide 
angle lens. Actually, in all the smartphones
that I've reviewed that has a macro lens,
most of them are really kind of disappointing,
but for the Samsung Galaxy A72, it's not that bad. And another thing, 
even though it doesn't have a dedicated depth sensor guys, the portrait shots are still good. The subject-to-background separation
is still good. It's just that the shots are not that very detailed and crispy. For the photos
taken by the front camera, they are pleasing,
but I can't say that it's so good. Actually, the quality 
that it gave me is kind of the same if we were to compare it
with the Samsung Galaxy A52. And same with its siblings,
it's also capable of 4K and 1080p video recording,
but only in 30 FPS. And since Samsung included
an OIS, same in the primary camera and its telephoto lens,
the videos came out quite stable even though we're 
in 4K video recording. Even the front camera, guys,
is also capable of 4K at 30 FPS video recording. Now guys, if I were to choose between all the Samsung A series
that were released recently, actually I'd rather get
the Samsung Galaxy A52 5G. The A72 guys is good,
but I do think it's only for those people
that prefer a smartphone that's bigger. These are the type of people
that who likes to play, or those who wants
a bigger display, because they often watch. And also, if you're picky
when it comes to color and you really want
to buy the purple color of this A72, then don't hesitate (laughs) and go for the A72. Personally, of course
since this is my review, if I get to pick one,
I'll go with the A52 5G. It's size is just right,
it's perfect in my hands. It's not that heavy. It's already 120Hz display, and it's 5G ready,
though its battery is smaller, since I'm just usually
in the house, I really prefer that phone more. Now, if we won't talk about
the Samsung and its other alternatives, actually there are cheaper phones
that has AMOLED display, 5G ready, and have
a more competitive chipset which is the POCO F3. It's just that the color availability
that we have for that phone is not that great. And another thing,
the advantage of Samsung is that it has three years 
OS update and four years security update. That's one of the advantages
if you will be getting the Samsung Galaxy A72. And also, this depends
if you're kind of used in One UI or in MIUI since 
this Samsung Galaxy A72 already has the latest One UI 3.1
based on Android 11. So yeah, I hope you appreciated
our video for the Samsung Galaxy A72. I won't be doing a video
for the Samsung Galaxy A52 5G, but we have a video
about the Samsung Galaxy A32 which is coming very soon,
because we still have a lot to review. Take it slowly since I want
to experience the phones until I can, because I don't want to say that it's a review video if I didn't experienced it, right? Again, it's your Tech Girl, Mary,
and see you on my next video. Bye guys! [Music] do [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] do [Music] so [Music] do [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] do [Music] do [Music] [Music] do [Music] so [Music] do you what is up guys techrax here so in this video we're going to be doing a drop test of two of the greatest smartphones out there we have the brand new iPhone 11 Pro beautiful condition here and we have the new samsung galaxy s 20 now this is also a brand new variant here I'm gonna pop it open just to show you guys I got the coral blue color this is unlocked beautiful smartphone let's take a first-hand look at just how this device looks like ooh oh my goodness I can't even look at this I can't this is just too good to be true too beautiful man the color just pops absolutely amazing there's like a little bit of a hint of I don't know I'm seeing some purple in there too crazy let's take off that little wrap here we'll take this little sticker off the top as well as its booting up the Samsung Galaxy S 20 so both of these smartphones have Gorilla Glass 6 on them which means that they should both survive about equally how are they going to land however which one is gonna crack more guys that's going to be the question we're gonna be able to find out obviously this is more of a spontaneous drop test there's no real factor to prove you know exactly and be precise with it with this drop test but this is definitely a good idea of seeing exactly which one is a little more durable regardless so we're going to be dropping both phones 30 stories from the top of a spiral staircase we're gonna see which one survives the galaxy s 20 first the iPhone 11 pro now to make it a little more realistic I decided to get two of the exact same hard shell cases one for the s20 one for the 11pro I'm not sponsored by this company guys these are just some random generic cheap cases I found they're like twenty dollars each and I want to see with the same cases so I'm as close as possible to being accurate with these drops even though it's still a spontaneous kind of drop test so we're at the spot guys we have both the iPhone 11 Pro and the Samsung Galaxy S 20 both of the phones in a hardshell case a clear case the same brand I want to show you beautiful devices guys we're actually going to be dropping both of them kind of at the same time about five seconds apart with the case and then another drop without the case so we're gonna be able to see again I don't know how it's gonna land guys we're gonna have the phones with slow-mo let's see what happens we're gonna be dropping each one by one first one going down is the iPhone 11 pro and whenever you're ready we're gonna be dropping it crazy crazy loud and next up so take note guys a whole bunch of more bounces with a Galaxy S 20 so I have a feeling that one is definitely and be more cracked let's get down and see what happened so here's the iPhone 11 pro guys let's see what happened we already have a line here on the left which is pretty crazy but looks like there's not even a crack it's just seems like there's a white line on the left side of the phone a black spot in the middle so some bleeding going on there let's take a look at the back here real quick what happened the back is shattered though but that's crazy no shatter - the camera lens itself and the phone is in overall good condition after a drop in this cheap little twenty dollar case and finally the galaxy s 20 so let's go ahead and take a look what happened here so the back is the backing in fact I couldn't see yes it has cracked the back is shattered let's take a closer look here oh my goodness the front is fully working there's not a single crack on the front and I honestly thought there'd be a lot more damage a good decent sized amount of cracks still nothing as bad as the iPhone 11 Pro finally guys no case for the iPhone 11 Pro and the samsung galaxy s 20 both are still survivors obviously a little more damage with the iPhone 11 Pro but this time we're gonna be dropping them both at the same time once again the back so we're going to do this in five four three two one crazy crazy loud guys let's get to the bottom and see what happened check it out guys both the iPhone 11 Pro and the Galaxy S 20 dropped practically at the same floor so here's the results of the iPhone 11 Pro still somehow glimmering a little hope of light here working just a little bit obviously in a matter of minutes this is probably going to fully break foam is a little warm to the touch hitting the power button that's the iPhone 11 Pro and the Galaxy S 20 so let's take a look at the back here real quick so the back is fully shattered this time around in the front definitely unable to really do anything with this foam so it's completely bleeded out got some white some bright green on the display as well take a look here it's power off and now this one is doing the same thing so final results of the iPhone 11 Pro and samsung galaxy s 20 drop test as you guys can see the 11pro took a lot more carnage with the front being fully beat up it was still working for a couple seconds there but now it's definitely not working there's the back fully shattered the galaxy s 20 on the other hand more of a survivor even though it's still cracked and it was also glimmering and glitching out there's a lot less of a shatter on the front look at this as we now we're seeing a whole bunch of green pumping up taking a look at the back still cracked as well but also not as bad as the iPhone 11 pro so that wraps it up further drop tows guys hope you guys enjoy this video as always stay tuned for more videos I'll catch you guys in the next one peace out google samsung and fitbit could they be combining to create the ultimate android watch soon that sounds like an impossible dream team proposition and yet at this year's google i o developer conference google announced partnerships that sound like they're very much headed in that direction let's break it down [Music] so google announced first of all a lot of stuff involving wear os where os is google's watch os for android that you may not be wearing because it really hasn't taken the world by storm over the last bunch of years picking a watch for android has become difficult whereas apple has the apple watch and it seems very straightforward there are a lot of options on android and google's wear os which was meant to be the main way to go doesn't feel like the main option samsung has had its pretty great galaxy watches for years and a lot of people have opted for those instead of google's similarly there are dedicated fitness watches like fitbit or garmin now google acquired fitbit and now google is explaining how fitbit is going to start working its way into that watch ecosystem so samsung is part of the picture too and that's where it gets really interesting samsung and google announced a partnership and from this point forward samsung's watches are going to be running a combination of an os blending tizen and google wear os so that means that the next samsung galaxy watch is going to be one of those watches so i spoke with google's head of where as well as people from samsung and fitbit and got the whole picture as to what's going on and yes the two are coming up with a new operating system feel that's going to blend a lot of the wear os stuff with a lot of what samsung has been doing on its watches to create something that's more dynamic and works on higher end devices that's the interesting part because it suggests that there may be a focus on getting towards more premium smart watches to keep up with where the apple watch is the samsung has already been step by step with apple watch but software wise has not been part of the google wear os picture now it sounds like google's ready to bring a lot of those things including maps and google assistant along with some things like samsung's watch face designing feature blended together in some sort of uh not just a samsung watch but a a variety of watches that other manufacturers are going to start making uh as soon as this fall so does that mean that you should wait to get an android compatible watch yeah absolutely i would because also samsung said that this wear os move is going to be coming to future samsung watches but not to previous samsung watches so at this moment i would hold off on getting a samsung galaxy watch and wait to see what's coming next but it does sound incredibly promising it's going to be running google play as the software ecosystem we don't know yet if samsung's existing app ecosystem will make them move over or whether maybe they'll be the best of certain apps that will make the move and even google's existing play ecosystem may have certain apps that are cherry picked to make the move i don't know if it's going to be a seamless transition we're still trying to learn a lot of what this is about and google has not entirely laid that out yet but it does seem that if you have something in say samsung s health you'll be able to export that data and bring it over to google's fit ecosystem and use the data there now let's talk about fitbit fitbit is part of google now fitbit just launched a new tracker called the lux last year fitbit had a sensor filled watch called the fitbit sense and fitbit has never really had a watch that has had all the features of things like samsung galaxy or the apple watch in terms of you know the whole full phone call uh gps connected uh music playing like some of those elements have been there but not as fluid but there will be a fitbit watch running wear os at some point in the future but it doesn't look like it's going to be this year that watch will probably be a premium thing that will be above what the existing fitbit watchers are now should you get a fitbit now that's a little bit different because fitbit's slowly introducing its features into wear os apparently over the next year or so starting with a fitbit app that will launch like a tile in wear os probably towards the fall but that app won't have all of the fitbit features it's going to have some things like your today breakdown and some reminders to move but not necessarily all the stuff for heart rate and sleep that's still being worked out according to fitbit so if you really want that full fitbit experience on a watch and for me a lot of what fitbit brings to the table is about heart rate and sleep you'd still want to get a fitbit tracker at least for a while but it is interesting that down the road you might end up having a device that contains all of fitbit in a wear os watch yes that means a samsung wear os watch could have a fitbit app running on it and over time that fitbit app get might get more advanced so you could have samsung google fitbit all living on this advanced watch and that might take a year or two to really get there and who knows if it'll it'll really fully get there sometimes tech partnerships don't necessarily play out the way you expect and google does change track quite a bit on some of its initiatives for new technologies it sounds extremely promising and for all these years that i've been covering wearable tech and i remember looking at the samsung watch that launched on wear os or android wear which was called the samsung gear live back in 2014 uh you know samsung had a partnership with them going way back and you know you saw wearable tech drifting and what type of a watch you'd want to get kept fluctuating and there doesn't feel like there's been much of a settling on the android front this may enable future watches to finally lock down a little bit more with android google's already promising that this move to work with samsung and to build more advanced watches should result in having more carrier support lte for watches uh more support for google pay on the watches and so it looks like they're trying to really catch up and make this thing work in a very reliable way the way you would expect in the same way with android on phones hopefully that all comes to pass and i think it really will help catch up on a real lacking feature on werews watches which has been healthtech a lot of the bleeding edge health features especially the ones that have gotten fda clearance have been coming from companies like fitbit samsung and apple now samsung and fitbit have been coming to the picture to work with google and i would think that that's going to accelerate some of those wearable health tech possibilities on warehouse watches and google says that they're trying to work out where they're going with health tech to absorb some of the learnings from samsung and fitbit but fit google fit and fitbit there's a lot of fits here are not going to be merging yet they're going to exist as separate apps and there's no indication yet of when those two will allow data to flow between that's still going to be the case even with this partnership as far as we know so i hope that explained a little bit of what's going on with samsung google fitbit and the future of whatever watch you might be wearing on your wrist for android on one final note i have no idea if any of this stuff is going to work with ios google has not indicated that yet [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] what nice nanny someone has been here oh my god so excellent work thank you so [Music] excellent work so watch out [Music] so [Music] so watch out no watch out so [Music] [Applause] someone has been here so location [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] mark the location [Applause] someone's been here [Applause] [Applause] watch out [Applause] excellent work okay so [Music] [Music] [Music] you hey guys it's retirement and welcome back to my channel some of us guys my god and i'm full review or review so samsung galaxy m51 i know guys i left you hanging during my unboxing and first impressions and some of us making enough name time parameters guys of course battery life and charging capabilities devices so actually guys favorite mid-range device on samsung release 7000 milliamp hour battery capacity and a 25 watt pass charging it on smartphone at all so m51 so during my regular days of using this device on social media on facebook smartphone [Music] [Music] so i guess guys so during my charging test it only took me an hour and 50 minutes smartphone shampoo but [Music] so in terms of battery and the charging definitely this is the smartphone guys now worth recommending parasite guys making details respects and of course sample photos mirrors from 64 megapixels f 1.8 main camera a 12 megapixels ultra wide camera a 5 megapixels macro lens and a 5 megapixel step sensor template for the front camera marinating 32 megapixels guys in terms of the camera specs fire seven in the tayatini padding samsung nitto ultra white camera nothing by 12 megapixels usually smartphones nasa great price range 8 megapixels i don't really find it useful but knowing that from 2 megapixels now usually then so expect a higher quality than macro shots online nothing guys soon night shots actually pedophile might take no photos using the white and the ultra wide camera we can even take selfies guys using the night mode the photos turned out surprisingly good but knowing samsung guys especially their mid-range devices it is disappointing in terms of d white and especially the ultra wide actually so i guess it's not that surprising anymore if it's from a samsung mid-range [Music] device [Music] resolution we can shoot 4k using the rear camera and yes better in time and shoot using the ultra wide camera pair on young 1080p also don't expect lana peditimax switch between wide and ultra wide while video recordings at the new studio hey guys so here is my sample video using the 1080p at the catherine onion stabilization mode uh meaning attention padding is about with the 4k but i'm actually super shaky to the point now um in case you guys are taking videos say hi dogs [Music] and here's a sample video naman using the ultrawide actually i'm going to random quality and nakata say hi louie hi blair actually guys overall for that camera quality of the samsung galaxy m51 we are really getting the money or the amount that we've paid for well obviously nothing really that impressive normal flagship new level and 128 gig of internal storage in terms of that guys actually it's a long variety available which is actually enough nominal 128 gig but in case 90 enough you 128 gigs in your expandable nomento guys via micro sd card and samsung really has the best display telegram and in terms of size software immersive then guys the helmet from 6.7 inches full hd plus again a super amoled display bezels and higher refresh rates to be honest a lot of people are quite disappointed on this part especially expecting a silent display fingerprint pedal [Music] [Music] speakers [Music] [Laughter] [Music] in terms of [Music] 213 grams but actually i think muscle bigger in the manga is some coco x3 nfc guys again os knowing samsung it has the one ui based on android 10. so aluminum sectional notification drop down meringue blue light filter smart view of course burned and pushed on nfc a screen recorder it also has a quick share guys interesting toy ultra data saving anywhere guys date and of course in battery percentage don't worry guys fully customizable sas settings so mary i know over already for the samsung galaxy m51 honestly guys it's a very good device especially if you are looking for a smartphone upon all around talaga it may not have the best chipset for its price obviously guys may not be amending smartphones lower than this number but then again in terms of battery a super amoled display and a really nice set of cameras this will surely come to my mind guys smartphone pressure 20 023 000 pesos definitely i will not hesitate i recommend pull on samsung galaxy m51 actually the only downsides are devices though that i don't really see for drinks alone i was in 9990 pesos and exhaustion on first day salon and less than 500 which is actually also a great deal guys that's it guys again it's your target mary and see you on my next video bye In the world of tablets, there are two main
reasons why many consider Apple’s iPad Pro superior to Android tablets: silicon and software. Before the M1 chip, Apple’s A-series Bionic
processors were hard enough to beat. But now with the M1 on board, Apple has upped
the ante by infinity. Qualcomm’s best Snapdragon processors, as
well as Samsung's Exynos, are impressive, no doubt, but they don’t quite offer the
integration that Apple’s homegrown computing engine can. Then there’s iPadOS, the App Store, and
those two million apps designed just for the iPad including an advanced version of Adobe
Photoshop. Google hasn’t taken the tablet variant of
Android apps seriously for some time. Sure, most of them work on tablets, but not
enough of them have fully optimized versions for slates such as Samsung’s. Until that doesn't change, the user experience
on iPads will be better, period. But on the hardware side of things, Samsung
is giving Apple a run for their money. In fact, Samsung's flagship tablets are better
in almost all sectors except the silicon. And we have information about Samsung's next
tablet which suggests Samsung is taking the hardware game to a whole new level. You see Samsung's high-end Galaxy S smartphones
come in three variants these days, and it looks like 2021 is the year when the flagship
tablet lineup will mirror that logic. According to a huge leak out of South Korea,
there will be three variants of the Galaxy Tab S8. Those are S8, S8+, and a new addition the
Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra, a tablet so bonkers that you’ll be blown away. This information is coming from Samsung itself
via a survey it sent out to its customers in South Korea. It suggests, the Tab S8 Ultra will feature
a truly massive 14.6-inch OLED 120Hz display. This is laptop territory that we’re entering
now. It seems the tablet will have reduced bezels
according to the picture Samsung sent out. The bezels are so thin that they had to resort
to a notch to fit the dual front-facing cameras. Yes, the number of front cameras has been
increased, the specs of which are 8 MP wide + 5 MP ultrawide. Having thin bezels is great to look at, but
I'm not sure if that's a good idea on tablets. I mean you need something to hold on to especially
on a tablet of a proper laptop size. I guess time will tell. The tablet will measure an impressive 5.5mm
thin and weigh 650g. The larger surface area of the Ultra model
would allow Samsung to spread components out more, reducing the thickness. Also, it will have a ridiculous 12,000mAh
battery that supports 45W charging. The processor is unknown but it will be paired
with 8/12GB RAM and 128/512GB storage respectively. There's a dual 13+5MP camera setup at the
back. It supports S Pen, there are quad speakers
and Samsung may also launch a new premium keyboard accessory with 165° angle adjustment. The leak also shows off some on-device DeX
mode features, including a laptop mode, tablet mode, drawing mode, and viewing mode. And here are the specifications of the other
two Tab S8's. the S8 and S8+ and they offer some common features. There's also some pricing info the S8, S8+,
and the S8 Ultra will start at $740, $1,120, and $1,320 respectively based on the conversion
from Korean Won. Remember that it's for the Korean market so
the prices will differ worldwide. But rest assured the Tab S8 Ultra will be
the most expensive Samsung tablet ever. Anyway, let me what do you think about the
S8 Ultra and its ridiculous size in the comments down below and as always I'll see you tomorrow...Peace

let me go into my car videos here let's just pick two of these guys one two okay and that's it now you're gonna click on done and look at that it starts at the process right here and the same thing is reflecting right here okay so those two video files are now being transferred onto my windows and it's logging everything properly and then there's my incoming folder right there all these files got transferred over to that folder because that's how i set it up from this area right here as i showed you guys earlier now if i click on this one right here those video files let me just grab that window are in here as you can see already and a photo that i sent earlier and that's the same thing that you have here the good news is you can actually click this and that's going to start the video

change our lives. We also often talk about folding smartphones
that can change the entire industry, but so far they’re not doing very well because
they’re too expensive. Sooner or later, everything will change and
the price of such devices will greatly decrease. And it turns out the wait is not long, the
Galaxy Z Fold 3 and the Z Flip 3 are going to be significantly cheaper than their predecessors
according to the latest reports. The Z Fold 2 was launched at a $2000 price
tag last year while the Z Flip was launched at $1380. But Sammobile is reporting that the successors
of these two devices will be 20% cheaper. In other words, the Z Fold 3 could be almost
around 400 Dollars cheaper than the Z Fold 2 which turns out to be $1600 for those who
don't know math. While the Z Flip 3 will be cheaper by $276
which means the handset could be priced at $1099. Honestly, that's a substantial reduction especially
for the Z Fold 3 that in every way is better than its predecessor. The report mentions that the reason Samsung
might be implementing this strategy is to encourage more people to switch to foldable
smartphones. Plus Samsung will offer generous pre-order
incentives to customers who purchase the new foldables. That said, some of you might wonder that a
$400 price cut is too good to be true. But keep in mind that the Galaxy S21 Ultra
also saw a 15% price cut this year compared to the S20 Ultra, so this report isn't out
of the realm by any means. It’s worth noting that the leak says the
new foldables will be ‘up to 20% cheaper,’ so the prices could be a little higher. But still, it's great news that Samsung is
reducing the prices which should make foldable products a lot more accessible to general
consumers. With that said, Apple's WWDC event took place
today, which honestly turned out to be one of the most boring Apple events post-pandemic. But there are a couple of interesting things
that happened. First, Apple has finally decided to bring
Facetime to Android and windows. Well, Kind of. Because they aren't making a dedicated app
for these platforms, instead FaceTime is going to be available on the web so users can call
in from Android devices and Windows PCs. Apple is actually turning facetime into a
bit more of a Zoom-like video calling service as it allows you to grab a link to a scheduled
call so that you can share it with people in advance and join in at the right time. Another interesting feature is the universal
control. It lets you use Macs and iPads like they're
one machine. I mean you'll be able to bring an iPad next
to your MacBook and simply drag your cursor over from your laptop to the tablet and you
don't need any additional setup. It works seamlessly. This will let you do things like drag and
drop files between the two machines or use your laptop's keyboard to type out Spotlight
searches on the tablet. This way, you won't need to buy a separate
keyboard case to get a physical mouse and keyboard for the iPad, and like I've said
transferring files is more seamless than ever. But to summarise the rest of WWDC, Apple copied
a bunch of things from Google. They introduced live text which basically
is a copy of Google lens, Apple included AR features in Apple maps which again is already
available on Google maps for a while now. Anyway, do consider subscribing for all the
latest tech news and as always I'll see you tomorrow...peace out [Music] hey what's up mkbhd here and welcome to your first look and hands on with the galaxy s 21 ultra so right off the top of the year samsung's coming out swinging now i also have a video about the s21 and s21 plus dropping at the same time here so that'll be the first link below the like button check it out if you're interested but this is the big dog so we kind of know what to expect at this point from samsung's new ultra high end phones right so s21 ultra will start at 1200 bucks so it should be the best of what they can offer but just to look back for a second at s20 ultra this phone last year was kind of a whiff i mean it still did have a lot of the high end ultra numbers that you look for but because of the focus issues with the camera it was just never something you quite recommended it got passed on a lot for the money so the s21 ultra looks to get them back to the best of everything world with a lot of next-gen parts and pieces now right off the bat first thing you notice is the biggest change which is they've packed everything in this new design so we might as well just start with that so i got to handle these in the matte black and this sort of silver color so it looks just like the leaks and the rumors we're expecting and i think i like it now i don't know if i love it i'm still on the train that sort of a horizontal camera bump like nexus 6p was actually kind of peak but the more i look at this contour cut design the more futuristic it looks to me it kind of looks like someone was making a thicker phone with the huge cameras and then just melted it down to a thinner body for the rest of the phone it's kind of hard to explain it basically it looks like harvey dent like two face but on the smaller models it actually has a cool color contrast model with the side rails but i'll talk more about that in that video on the ultra it's all matte across the entire back which i love and then shiny on the sides so speaking of those cameras we've got four here on the back of the ultra it's a new second gen 108 megapixel main camera with ois at f 1.8 very curious to see how that'll shoot then you've got a 12 megapixel ultrawide which should be pretty sweet at 120 degrees and then two telephoto cameras you've got two a 3x telephoto and a 10x periscope lens so this is an interesting zoom situation i was playing with the phone trying to imagine why they would do it like this i i think samsung's probably done the math on well most people either zoom in a little bit or like all the way and so i guess if they're just getting a 3x and then the 10x will facilitate the space zoom that goes really far my curiosity is how will it do in between 3x and 10x we'll have to see but if you go in the camera app it looks very familiar it's the samsung stuff all these zoom buttons are still here but now you can see you can go all the way from that 3x to 10x and it's doing digital zoom in between those two numbers then from 10x on it's coming from the periscope lens and space zoom is still here so you can go all the way to 100 on the ultra and it's right off the bat actually looking much more stable than the last gen which is actually pretty nice there's also some improvements to the higher end modes like a director's view for more control over live switching between the cameras and recording from multiple cameras at once and there's also multi-device recording from both the phone's mics and your headphone mics at the same time and then improved single take mode so cool stuff here we all know the ultra and samsung's lineup is supposed to have the top of the line cameras and this is the best they can offer and you can you can even see the laser autofocus here so i'm almost surprised i didn't toss in a macro camera to sort of fill up the space and make an even grid but hey it's a periscope lens taking up that space instead begging to be tested so yeah lots of new camera parts it'll be interesting to see how these perform definitely make sure you subscribe to the channel if you haven't already to be among the first to see the review when it comes out we can test these things but enough about the back of the phone let's talk about the front so it's a big phone of course it's the ultra and that allows for a huge 6.8 inch quad hd oled display and this time it's quad hd at 120 hertz so you can see here in the settings it's at the 1440p resolution and motion smoothness is also set to adaptive up to 120 hertz so that's sweet but also this new adaptive refresh rate on the ultra is new and it'll automatically constantly be switching all the way up and down between 10 hertz and 120 hertz so that should help save a lot of battery in this adaptive mode it'll be really interesting to test to see how responsive it is and to see how much battery it saves so you imagine when you're not really doing anything on the display nothing's moving it throttles all the way down to 10 hertz i'm curious if that can bring it to the same battery life or close to the regular 60 hertz mode i'm not too worried about overall battery life the phone does still have a 5 000 milliamp hour battery so uh not concerned about being bad i'm just more curious if it can be amazing i also love that the display is nearly flat it is slightly rounded at the very edges but not nearly as much as i've seen it in other phones which makes me happy and there is the small cutout at the top for the ridiculous 40 megapixel selfie camera and they also dropped qualcomm's new much larger and hopefully faster in display fingerprint sensor back there it's 1.77 times larger than the last gen and i'm hoping less finicky too and the display's max brightness is now up to 25 percent brighter up to 1500 nits and there's a new ai based blue light shield option for better viewing comfort if you're into that but yeah everything else you're looking at here is right in line with what you'd expect from the 2021 samsung flagship great build quality it's ip68 water resistant the newest internals of course with the five nanometer snapdragon triple eight in this region it'll be the five nanometer exynos chip in other regions which will be interesting again to test to see how it fares with battery 15 watt wireless charging there's reverse wireless charging too great buttons tiny bezels the whole thing one interesting spec though that is missing there is no expandable storage anymore so the micro sd card is basically going extinct now samsung was some of the last ones to do in their flagships so there are only three specs for total storage on this phone 128 256 or 512 gigs and then so unlike the smaller s21 and s21 plus there's different amounts of ram on these versions so those all will have eight gigs of ram on the ultra you start at 12 gigs of ram for the 128 and 256 and if you go with the tip top half a terabyte max spec that'll have 16 gigs of ram so your trading your expandable storage for a lot of ram i guess also speaking of things that are gone no headphones or charger in the box confirmed like i've warned you this is gonna start happening very quickly across the industry iphone 12 was a huge domino to fall so now don't expect a power brick and a flagship phone from here on out but last thing let's talk about the s pen it was added to the s21 ultra s pen support now okay a lot of people saw this in the rumors leading up to this and thought oh that probably means the galaxy note is on its way out maybe they'll kill it soon i don't think so i when i this is just coming from my like hour of playing with the phone the stylus on the s21 ultra feels like a very optional add-on accessory where on the galaxy note well it's still an integral part of the note experience and it's just they're in very different worlds so first of all like i said it's an optional 40 accessory so if you want to buy an s pen for your s21 ultra it'll cost you and then it's actually compatible with other s pens of the past so if you have one already you can carry that too but the whole experience is passive so the whole low latency writing and drawing experience is all the same but there's no bluetooth or gesture controls like you would have on the note and then of course there's a whole how do you carry it question since there's no silo built into the phone so that's another optional accessory so you can get a stylus and a case for now 70 extra dollars and the phone sort of just clicks into this rubber slot in the side of the case which is fine i guess but it's it's definitely a very optional accessory and so if you're gonna go through all of that and spend extra money to to have a stylus on your high-end samsung phone i feel like the obvious choice is to buy a note where it slots in perfectly and neatly every time charges has the active experience has more features and of course there will be a note 21 ultra i guess it's not an of course thing i'm predicting there will be a note 21 ultra that people wanting a stylish consider later this year so i don't think the note's going anywhere but that's basically it for the new s21 ultra what do you think is this enough of a redemption i mean you get the huge numbers again you get a lot of next-gen pieces it seems to be going in the right direction there is of course the s21 and s21 plus launching alongside it on january 29th but if you're gonna spend the big bucks this is what you're gonna get and they've also launched smart tags and galaxy buds pro so samsung's clearly popping off right at the beginning of the year but let me know what you think is this the one you guys would pick or would you go for one of the other s21 models let me know thanks for watching i'll catch you guys in the next one [Music] peace [Music] so [Music] all right it's friday [Music] we gotta get it in on a friday that's what i was just saying yeah but take a few days i was just telling you tomorrow saturday i'm i'm gonna hop in the van and i'm just gone i don't even know early morning yeah maybe right now i can at least i can say that right now and then sure enough tomorrow i look at my watch it's three o'clock i'm like hey what do i mean what do i even do what i've been doing got hit that road been going on like a ontario beach tour you know just checking checking off checking out these different spots mostly close by just testing the waters well you you mean it in more more than one way sure yeah that's how you mean it so you'll be amazed even this province man you'll be amazed yeah we have a lot of space this province this country you'd be amazed a lot of people that go most people at least for especially for the last couple last year i say couple years it feels like a couple years but for the last year it's been a lot of couch time people lying around you know a lot of gaming and hey man everything's got a place gotta fit in i was playing cod today for a video that's about to come out and did you see me ranting and raving and screaming over there you had a good time i was like man i don't get any chance to play video anyway it's all right because i got the youngsters i'm trying to show them around uh even in the midst of what a weird year it's been and so i'm about to hit the road tomorrow but we got to get it in because we got lots to talk about before i hit any road sure you know you down for that or what nice all right let's kick it off with a little bit of google plus samsung samsung and google they've been getting tight they've been shaking hands i don't know what it is i don't know what got into them but all of a sudden after i o you saw at i o they were like yeah you know we're going to keep doing this android where we're just going to team up with samsung they had the thing with the tizen operating system we're just going to team up nonchalant yes how they said it you had sundar up there and i was like that's a bit strange it's kind of funny that they would i mean you got google mega software company putting together the cleanest android the way they want it and kind of uh separating themselves a little bit but then they reach out and say you know what samsung you're samsung you are and we want to recognize that and we think you can help us and i i kind of like these moves because samsung does some things and they do some things like nobody else does things you don't know what they do like nobody else what's that displays yeah they do displays like nobody else they move units on the smartphone segment and they're currently really the only player in the foldables i mean let's talk for real i know you're gonna say huawei's over there i know you can say royale with cheese is in in there you can't have these ones because as far as i can tell like legitimate contenders that people are talking about at least globally like i'm over here at least globally yeah it's been samsung it's been the fold stuff is there some other device i'm missing is my brain on pause because you were looking around you're looking left and right you're getting shifty over there uh not that i can think of all right put you on the spot it's will's fault not mine they do displays well motorola yeah look at you willy doo's all grown up ladies and gentlemen just have to put that one in there you know what he was complaining earlier he said i gotta take care of all these giveaways you gotta give will do a round of applause right now because we've been doing a lot of giveaways recently and uh big time like numbers of winners like it's not just one winner it's so many winners and it's people don't i mean not that anybody would understand because it's such a unusual thing to have to do but it's just a lot of leg work it's like it's a leg workout who knew that bringing a one phone from one place to another is just ridiculously expensive time-consuming expensive man when we did 100 iphones and i saw the shipping bill i was like what did i sign up to yeah it's like i understand the phones i kind of knew what i was in for 100 phones they're like a thousand each okay 100 grand and then i'm like oh by the you know lou you better factor in another 20 or whatever it was yeah some ridiculous thing like what to move these around anyway will do has been working on that so uh you're gonna have to excuse him today if you know if he gets a little a little bit short if he gets a little bit kurt a little bit a little bit uh yeah excuse the like just excuse him in advance no matter what he does everything that i say or do just excuse all of that just excuse him for once guys anyway they partner with samsung display that's the word here google expected to release this first folding phone in collaboration with samsung display samsung display looking to expand its ultra thin glass business by offering the technology to companies other than samsung electronics themselves this is big samsung sells displays to other manufacturers other smartphone companies but not all their technologies they hold on to a couple for themselves [Music] by putting this product out there imagine all the different makers that might just want to put their hands on that and say all right we want to do our version of it now you know google in the os we've been seeing a little bit of a little tidbit here and there about how they're continuing to embrace foldables and shifting uh flipping and flapping like of of the os to deal with these different futuristic interfaces and now we're starting to see like okay maybe there's some maybe this is why there's an acceleration in that direction maybe google believes in this thing the folding thing and let me tell you something if google gets behind it they make a little thing called android they do yes and so what that means is more native support for cool features that can take advantage of a folding display once you get all these engineers on board they got a few employees they got a skilled individual and taking nothing away from samsung but you get multiple parties and companies working on this transition towards a foldable and all of a sudden you're going to see some more killer functionality pop up and then a guy like you put your hands on it you say aha yeah that's why i need this that's a great collaboration look what's going on here oh i mean that looks impressive these renders a couple of renders yeah pixel fold i guess pixel fold there it is cool uh oh now you've been a pixel guy you left for samsung right now but you've been on those pixels yeah they're solid photos what do you think you you give a folding pixel a shot uh well i've always wanted to try a but let's say you got the choice you got the pixel foldable or you got the z-fold three i gotta go for the pixel is that right uh their camera quality is really good yeah they do stuff with the software so anyway z-fold three uh wait what are we on which z-fold are we on right now two we're on two so three three is soon though right there were rumors about it anyway uh supposedly been they've been perfecting this ultra thin glass utg technology that better protects flexible screens from breaking from repeating repeated folding action there's still a lot to be done on the hardware side of things to get to the place we're probably going with this technology but the more that jump into it the more companies that samsung makes this equipment available to the greater the likelihood that the thing sticks around a little bit longer uh and and then and then it also opens it up to brands you know you heard of these brands like apple apple already buys this place from samsung and they say oh we can just buy that off the shelf they might get to the drawing board themselves i don't know i'm just saying i'm just putting that out there but i'm with you folding pixel i might take a look at it yeah it's quite possible today's sponsor is expressvpn expressvpn helps me take a look at the things i want to take a look at and that's a key when i'm on the internet it's uh something i've gotten used to over the years in fact it's

later for three extra months free apple we just sort of talked about them a little bit as far as the bending screens are concerned they're nowhere close on that front nor would you really expect them to be and they may ignore it completely i mean they kind of they've ignored many things or or happily walked into them later than other companies yeah going about it at their own pace when they feel the thing has been perfected i guess i don't know yeah they're usually first or they're last with something i'm looking for these old ed screens in these ipads like that's the thing i've been looking for but anyway we got some news here courtesy mark german debbie wu over on bloomberg and they say apple's next ipad pro is going to have wireless charging we're finally going to get that new ipad mini and the ipad pro is going to stop being aluminum and start being glass all around as you may expect considering the fact that in order to add wireless charging you have to get rid of that aluminum in most cases almost all cases wireless charging on an ipad seems like an odd thing to demand i don't know how if it's going to be some sort of a pad apparently they still haven't given up on that air power thing was that the name of it yeah apparently they're still working on it gotta figure out the heat the apple watch this and that like are you gonna have an entire surface that just charges your whole apple life why don't they just sell a desk at this point won't they just apple desk the whole thing is wireless chargeable apple workstation you put your colorful imac on it all sorts of colors they're not gonna do it well we need to stop we're not going to do it but the thing about the thing about wireless charging is like okay so on the phones you have qi compatibility yep so it works on any wireless charger but then apple eventually makes their own wireless charger and this is what they come up with you see how i just keep pulling from my bag of tricks over there yeah you always look at it if i pull the camera no no no no no because it's gonna be misinterpreted it's gonna be misinterpreted because people are gonna look and say hey that's a big garbage product right now it's magic it's magical exactly when i just pulled from over there like damn how did he have access to that so quick apple when they approached a wireless charger themselves this is what it looked like this little magnetic creature and so my question is okay with the ipad is it going to be something like this will this work will it be a small little circle which is actually wirelessly chargeable and it's a magnet that slaps on and then that can interface with the the variety of cases and accessories that exist and all of a sudden just magnets galore as far as charging goes uh ipad sales are skyrocketing ipad has been exceeding expectations are they yeah did you know can you tell me why actually uh go ahead will working from home will i do am i right will he do his name's willy doo don't forget it i don't care what his twitter handle says all right i don't care i don't care if he doesn't have the official willy do on twitter all right as far as i'm concerned that's willy do right there and he he's got all the answers and he's never messed up not once and he's not planning on doing it into the future and as he stated this whole there's been winners and losers with the pandemic thing ipad has been a winner for whatever reason people say you know what i'm at home i'm on the couch i need to uh do my work do my video communication and i need to watch my content yeah and i'll tell you something man you sit down on the couch with an ipad you watch your content it's a comfy thing it's a nice experience and and you justify it because you're like look i'm not going back and forth to the office i'm not spending money on gas and transportation i need to upgrade this right here didn't you get a rebate from like your insurance company did you get one of those uh yeah i forgot how much though well you know you don't have to get into the details i wasn't pressing you like that let me just pull it out right now no no no no no you keep it private but yeah the world changed and and ipad was a beneficiary a lot of people thought this is this is uh a thing worth buying in fact apple's tablet sales jumped 79 in the first three months of 2021. 79 see i felt like the ipad was getting a bit cold and then all of a sudden m1 comes along and then all of a sudden pandemic comes i guess pandemic then m1 but either way and they got this i mean it's not perfect this uh mini led thing it's not perfect but it looks you know in the right circumstance it looks like an improvement in most cases for me it's crazy powerful anyway they said they sold a lot they're doing really well and they're going to continue to improve and invest in this because now it represents a larger share of their revenue structure and the main thing or the other big thing here is they also got to improve the ipad mini if they're going to be invested in this ipad ipad situation that thing is dated so apparently you're going to do that trim the bezel down get rid of the home button get the face unlock going and at an entry level price have you ever used the ipad mini exclusively yeah man got ipad minis all over the place in my house my kids had ipad minis for a long time i mean from from the old days what did they use it for well i mean in in the early stage i mean they don't use it anymore right they have different stuff now but it would be kids specific apps it would be like i don't know little puzzle games or uh youtube kids i don't know if youtube kids was around back then but being kids kids on an ipad why what do you what do you got what do you want to say about um i'm wondering uh if people use the ipad mini for yes reading because it's more the size of like a paperback yeah yeah and also doubles as like you know so ipad os yeah you can browse the internet the ipad mini it's weird right now because it has like a seven inch display and you got phones lots of phones like six and a half six point eight inch so it just feels really weird because it's not a very big display it's a lot of bezel you're holding it's just outdated however at the time it was a nice option next to the full-size ipad because as you said it was a little more portable you could hold it for longer periods without any type of fatigue because of the form factor and certainly for one-handed use you could hold it with one hand pretty easily and typing is actually a little nicer on it because of the condensed keyboard thumb typing feels pretty natural sort of feels like a like a big phone almost like a galaxy fold that i just talked about right anyway it's desperately in need of an update but i like the idea of uh slightly small i mean i just like options i guess i like more products to choose from who wouldn't but i think one of the one of the reasons has been neglected is because the ipads in general like i said it was kind of slowing down pandemic comes along things explode and they're like yeah let's update that let's more more models more features wireless charging i don't know glass i don't know one thing i will say people can be rough with their ipads like carry it under the arm slap it into bags so you have to have the right glass going on you go full glass model because you use a big sheet of glass too is it heavier too or no glass gonna be heavy too okay google's apparently to follow apple's lead as far as uh advertisers are concerned and the tracking stuff although i don't know how this is a tough one because google's an advertising company i'm like how you gonna you can't can you really follow their lead exactly because your entire platform exists to provide people with services that are ad subsidized it's your business model right i know you're getting into hardware now i know you have yeah you can pull profit from elsewhere but i think like i don't know what it is 90 of their businesses i don't know i don't even want to put a number on it but they're doing they do the majority of online advertising and profit greatly from it so a portion of that is getting to know personal information of people so you can better target things so i think that this mostly applies to the interac like the exchange of your information between parties sharing with third party google already allows android users to opt out of personal personalized ads but software developers may still access the user's advertising id that's your unique id will that says hey this is willy doo right here and and these are his activities and interests and so forth now they don't need to share your name you can opt out and then they don't have the attachment but they still have the advertising id so they have a profile so to speak a unique string of characters starting late this year if a user is opted out of personalized ads the advertising id will no longer be available so even that string of characters which could potentially tie back to your interests and behaviors and so forth it will just pop up now for that third party as a bunch of zeros instead um so it will it be as simple as uh like a dial dialog box you know opt out or just you know i think you got to dive into settings still oh yeah yeah i think so let's see following the change if a user is opted out of personalized ads the advertising id or maybe when you set up your device company send a policy update that this rollout will affect apps running on android 12 devices starting in late 2021 will expand apps running on devices that support google play in early 2022. okay so maybe maybe there will be a prompt at some point because this is rolling out into the future it said it will provide an alternate solution to support essential use cases such as analytics and fraud prevention so though it will depend oh here we go google's advertising makes up eighty percent of google's revenue so i mean i don't know that you can ever get to the apple extent considering how core to that it's kind of interesting though i think of google as an ad company and they've transitioned to 20 of their business not being related to ads so actually i'm looking at that number and saying that's not bad i'm saying you're diversifying over here yeah so you get the hardware i don't know what else they got going on uh servers and services because like google drive we pay for that premium monthly subscription and there's no ad component there i'm not getting advertising in there although you sometimes you get very angry at google drive uh one of the many things that you lose your cool over yeah the little things but like i said guys take it easy on world today because it's been a rough one all right apple is mandating that employees get back to the office get your butts back here oh yeah you've been on vacation too long that's what tim said he never said that i said that i said that tim said that because i was just joking tim said for all that we've been able to achieve while many of us have been separated the truth is that there has been something essential missing from this past year each other that's what's been missing huh from the past each other really yeah don't you remember when you were when when we we were no longer coming in here what was your life like at that point uh boring that's pretty much boring it's because like did you feel like you were missing people yeah like when we come to work it's production like we actually do stuff we talk in person humans and uh we we don't do like remote stuff not really we i mean there's things there's things that we do that are part of the job that we do remember sure yeah absolutely actually quite a bit but not the core aspect yeah actually like making videos core aspect of it so yeah that i missed quite a lot well i know you were missing the work but i'm saying were you missing people of course did you get to a moment where like yeah where are they couldn't even see family where are these where's people yeah you go to a point like that right well that's that's exactly what he's trying to say here we're missing the essential thing which is each other now obviously things have loosened up a lot in well the u.s and canada very recently other places are every country's in a different situation but people are maybe less lonely now and people got vaccinated their living life to a certain extent that's what i seem to see but still there was this question about well what about the future of work is there any need to be in the office for a lot of these types of jobs is there a way in which people can just be distributed wherever they want like we heard news about shopify over there and they said we don't need this office and there's many others i i can't it's not coming to mind right now but there were a number of huge companies employing a lot of people that said yeah remote's fine well this is the remote thing yeah a lot of programmers and developers mostly them but i'm sure there's many other professions as well that could be working remotely like annually right absolutely yeah video conference calling has narrowed the distance between us to be sure but there are things that simply cannot replicate this is still part of his quote can't replicate the closeness the collaborative environment anyway here's what they're going to do the new schedule will require most employees to work in the office on mondays tuesdays and thursdays at minimum and some will be asked for four or five days per week depending on the job but there's a new provision that employees have the option to work remotely for two weeks out of the year what do you think about this setup uh i think people will uh be annoyed at first really they don't want to go back there don't apple employees love that spaceship sure but maybe they've been so comfortable working from home maybe it's just like a period of adjustment for the next couple of weeks yeah why do you think and why do you think apple is demanding that they come back because tim cook said so well yeah but what's the incentive for tim what does he misses his pals or uh do you think productivity goes down when people are not physically there or the job is less fun or like what which element i think you're right like all all of the above but probably productivity takes a hit eventually and mental health i guess for him to kind of think like oh everyone's just working from home maybe we should bring everyone together as sort of like a mental ease you know what maybe there's a camaraderie issue too where without anybody getting together the sense of team and teamwork is a tougher they have those like town square things right oh they do all that town hall well they do all that yeah all of those you can do what they do so yeah maybe they're missing that uh here's a company that definitely does a town hall town square walmart walmart is going to be giving away 740 000 smartphones to employees 740 000 just get that in your head how many people walmarts employ it's obviously more than that but 740 000 are gonna get this free samsung smartphone that's a bit misleading because the smartphone is being provided for the purpose of work first and foremost they currently walk around a lot of the employees and they have some sort of like a terminal thing for it could be for inventory or something like that it's obviously not as nice as a smartphone but what kind of a smartphone would you give to people in that type of environment that's where samsung comes in because samsung and i know this from experience they've actually put out a number of interesting rugged smartphones in the past i had some of the active lineup from previous galaxy devices which will have this like rubberized thing you can drop it increased water resistance works better with gloves anyway they're still making this stuff and there's a device here which i had no clue it wasn't even on my radar and actually it was just in your results there the samsung galaxy x cover pro is to your left there this is the device and it's ruggedized all over the place drop it kick it dip it i'm not advising you to do those things it's ip68 and it's meant to get beat up and carried around and live in a work environment i was like you know what i might check this phone out kind of cool i like it as an option now it's listed as a business device i think it shows up in their business section it has increased touch sensitivity go back to that section there this is a key for individuals who work with gloves could be in a shipping facilities and warehouses and well obviously certain certain retail so the xcover pro features an intuitive display that lets you interact with your device even with gloves on enabling you to work outside or enjoying the outdoors without any issue i'm talking regular gloves so increased touch sensitivity cool so anyway they're going to provide i mean that's a big order imagine your samsung you get the order oh you need a million phones cool yeah we'll hook you up damn is there like a sales rep on that is there commission on that that's a deal right there anyway this is some of the features it will have it'll have their scheduling in there he'll have push to talk between employees signing into work by phone and voice activated personal assistant in the coming months the company plans to add a feature that will help shorten the time it takes employees to get items from the stock room to the sales force they're gonna tweak it and uh yeah more samsung at walmart i was very excited to discover a new samsung device i don't think i mean it's not like a spec champion or anything like that no it's mostly about the rugged aspect yeah so we have a confirmation that that tesla model s plaid did break the quarter-mile mile record the confirmation came from jay leno who was speaking freely on a podcast and they didn't discover it until recently someone was looking around they're like i think jay leno's on that pocket listen through the whole thing and they're like oh wow he talked about that moment because he had been uh what was the the site was drive tesla canada that had spotted his presence or at least posted about it when this new model s plaid was over there at the track and they were like again it was completely speculative but they said it's breaking records over there right and jade leno was there he wasn't driving no no no not the record one right no no but anyway he goes on this podcast called spikes car radio and is there a quote oh yeah he says this i'll tell you what i did i went up to fomozo dragway in bakersfield and the teslaplat dot dot dot i drove by and the nhra guy was there to make it official it turned a 9.247 at 152 miles per hour that's a quarter mile time 9.247 that's fast will don't you remember we were trying the other day about fast and furious all they needed was a 10 second car and those things had to be souped up to the kills uh-huh all they needed was a tesla that's all that's all i needed was a plaid and they could all they had to do was go talk to jay leno yeah so how come tesla didn't really like announce it announce it i don't know what made this a big deal i think probably because they're so backed up with this car they're so delayed that it's like you don't really want to make a this car is so good you can't get it and everyone's like yeah i know i already i know i ordered it and they're like uh tesla okay the car is bad don't worry the car's bad never mind yeah um so tesla had said though that that you could expect to achieve numbers in this neighborhood they said that the top speed is 200 miles an hour and the 0 to 60 should be 1.99 seconds that will give you a quarter mile and 9.23 at 155 so obviously that's optimal conditions and you like to see what it can do in the real world which is what jay leno was talking about but that's awful close to the you hear my clicks there that's awful close to the advertised time that could have been expected jay leno confirms it so of course it makes news anyway it's in spike's car radio and it's at the 13-minute 50 mark if you're curious to hear jay say it in his own words but this is going to be a fast car period um congrats i guess definitely definitely definitely congrats oh no but they but they got to deliver the thing because otherwise it doesn't really matter does it no you gotta deliver uh how about this for an alternative i mean we talk about tesla tesla and and pretty much every other ev manufacturer that's out there they've been putting the batteries down in the floor of the car low center of gravity uh skateboard style design is what they call it you just plop the car on top of it all the weight all the batteries are down on the floor you also get a frunk gives you if you get a frog um now does it always have to be that way you hear you have a group imagining an alternative saying that there are some downsides to having the batteries down in the floor for one the driving position the headroom the type of designs that you can do because you're inhibited by this one component having to be down there and so this and and also range and so this group what do they go by paige roberts is a london-based startup claims it can improve ev range by 30 with his unconventional design now what they did here is they put the batteries in between the front and back seats and mounted vertically and so it looks like the rear seats face backwards the front seats obviously face frontwards and the batteries they sit in between those two so that the backs of the seats are up against it i don't know does this give you tremendously more room it doesn't look like it but i'm sure they did the math on whatever greater capabilities they have here they're not competing with other items down there in the floor region there are some downsides i can imagine one of the things people touted with the electric cars is that having that low center of gravity really makes the car feel planted right like for handling and whatnot so if you get the weight up higher maybe there's less of that although i imagine just based on this article that the group that designed it was imagining it in a more maybe in a less sporty car maybe in a more mass production a people mover type of scenario yeah the design isn't for any ev it works best with small electric cars more specifically sleek and sporty four seat vehicles okay because of the designs low height and short wheelbase so i guess they feel like they could get the roof line a little bit lower because you're not competing with so much material on the floor because i don't know about you but if you ever travel past like a a model y or a model x it's yeah it's a tall boy you know the sailboat there it is speaking of sailboats remember we were talking about that ridiculous 28 million dollar rolls royce yeah dude i uh found more appreciation after watching that clip i saw the whole construction video of the boat tail super cool yeah you went you went into it yeah nice uh yeah you don't really appreciate it until you actually like hear what the design it's all because it's so deep inside the details yes you know it's so granular when you really pay attention you look at it from a mile away without the microscope and it's like okay it's a car but then you get up close and like you see this chiseled component yeah it took 10 years exactly only the finest materials and only one craftsman that's capable of producing unicorn hair yeah whatever it is yeah anyway it's really impressive you got this rumor or i guess it's a report it's a report via the rob report and they know about rich people things they claim that that boat tail that we had seen the 19-foot rolls-royce record-breaking new car as far as value is concerned a number that was speculated 28 million dollars they believe that this is jay-z going to jay-z and beyonce one of them one out of the three but the but this one specifically because they're not all going to be the same and the reason being well there's a couple of reasons but there's a bottles in the back uh champagne armand de bruyne breneck which apparently jay-z is a co-owner of this company so that was one giveaway when you saw the type of bottles of champagne in the back i'm gonna keep going with the giveaways here here uh if you're prepared for that well go ahead by the way the report was originally from the uk's daily telegraph okay um i want to get this right oh there were also pre-existing reports that the owner was in america and that he and his wife were involved in the music business so that's the level of detail you got there okay that's fine that works for jay-z as well next they talk about the color which is an azure blue finish which they believe could be some sort of indicator because they got the their first child is named blue ivy so they think that could be some sort of connection and then of course the champagne cooler with the brand that jay-z partially owns and then on top of that rolls-royce refuses to say who purchased it but i feel like we're going to find out eventually anyway but anyway but they said here's their quote in broad terms rolls-royce coach build clients are significant individuals i mean it doesn't tell you much will you as far as i'm concerned you're a significant individual right yeah you want to afford to vote yes i think you can finance it sure yeah uh here we go this continues they are collectors patrons of the arts and men and women who have commissioned some highly celebrated architecture this is them saying who it is without saying who it is their ambition is to create a permanent statement something profound that moves beyond the normal constraints listen to these words right now tell me you don't want that anyway they say that recently jay-z became raps first billionaire so that would help with the 28 million price tag it doesn't sound to me like they have irrefutable evidence but anyway it's a report you tell me what you think you think if you think it's a jay-z's boat tail or not dude what are you gonna do uh with the champagne if you own a boat tail well you're gonna drink it no you you i mean you just leave it right it's part of the collector's item yeah you won't drink it and just leave the bottle well you know what actually if i got the 28 mil then there's two for sure i'm drinking if i got the 28 mil to easily put on it uh i can replace the bottle that's what the bottles look like unless you you're telling me it's like numbered and it's some something i thought this was just limited to the car no i don't believe so no you can look it up if you want to get to the bottom of it you're going to go full detective look up armand de bruyne breneck which is b or brignac b-r-i-g-n-a-c that doesn't sound french when i say it like that so yeah if you you look it up look at google images i think the bottle looks like that all right yeah i think it's the one on the far right there that like platinum looking one no no in in the picture that you had but like i think it's that one right yeah yeah so yeah so you just whatever drink it and then pop pop a new one in there i mean you got to be drinking champagne all day you got lots of celebrate you got this vehicle yeah just pull up and then uh i set up the umbrella yeah you're obsessed with this like yourself having a picnic in the south of france that's going to happen for you one day italy or whatever countryside it's the same thing it's the same thing man yeah i'm telling you it's the same thing but a lot of people don't know like there's a you know moving between those countries there's like a middle zone there where you got people who speak italian you got people who speak i'm talking a french riviera over there right let's go get my boat tail first i went there a couple of times i was over there in uh nice and can where the film festival is oh okay it's insane what do you mean um it's so nice it's an honor it's a ridiculous place that's how how nice and beautiful it is that region but yeah you drive along there you can find yourself in italy so i'm just saying maybe your trip maybe you can do both yeah i'll ride that line you can go south of france and then you get yourself into italy and you do all of it this next story might be my favorite of the whole bunch today and i know people sent it to me and somehow it didn't register how cool it was and then i'm reading a little bit more and i'm like oh my god we gotta talk about this this is this is this is i love this i i got you know a history with this united airlines is buying 15 supersonic aircraft from boom supersonic depending on safety tests united may increase its order to 50 supersonic jets look at that thing right there uh you're not you're not happy okay listen it's about damn time you got military jets that can bring you get you across the world super quick and by the way i just need to get this other way yes if you travel fast you burn a lot of fuel this company has an eco plan to solve that all right so stop with that for now but it's been roughly the same speed you travel across the world and we got people trying to go to space i'm looking at you elon i'm looking at you jeff and can we just like can we just improve the jets first okay maybe the jets maybe through improving the jets we get better tech for space anyway i don't know maybe not right but we had this this existed there was a jet called the concorde which i'm familiar with i was obsessed with for a while when i was a kid my because you wanted one my my nono told me once that having traveled on it i don't know where he went maybe it was to london i can't remember but spoke of uh of uh an experience of speed that at the time i think was exclusive as far as commercial travel was concerned now it went out of commission they couldn't make it work it's pretty rugged on the inside not all that luxurious i mean it kind of looks like a military plant on the inside but it was fast and it was fast all the way back then and then we were like nah we can't be doing these supersonic things it doesn't work the business model doesn't work but do me a favor and go to the wikipedia for the concord i just want to check the speed on it because i think this new one is even faster but of course we can check mach 2.04 was the speed which is around 1 354 miles per hour or 2180 kilometers per hour so this is the concord seating for 92 to 128 passengers this was all the way back in 1969 this new jet that united is apparently purchasing 15 of uh the speed here is mach 1.7 so not quite as fast as the concord but very close and a lot more luxurious on the inside as you're gonna see as you as you scroll here so uh you know okay scroll a little bit more to the interior cabin picture like you could fly there will come on man you could sit there yes and what if i was to tell you that you because you're a big uh you're a big japan guy well actually they don't have the japan timing in here but we can we can figure it out based on these other flight times new york to london is typically seven hours you do that in three and a half so it cuts it in half los angeles to sydney is a 15 hour trip try six hours and 45 minutes tokyo is what 10 or 11 from here uh no come on man it's come on well yeah i don't remember oh too late i got it 16. uh dorita airport oh no no wait a sec that's with a stopover you did a stoplight i heard a stop over here yeah yeah so we needed chicago we we had you know we there must be a direct no uh is there no direct flight no one's doing that air canada to uh narita toronto tokyo direct oh yeah here we go 12 hours non-stop air canada oh okay 12 hours 55. okay so you go you you do that in six sitting here you do that in six you're sitting there and it's direct it's a direct flight and you happen to be on a fastest moving commercial jet and you feel really cool about it oh i forgot to tell you it's gonna cost you a few dollars they did not release pricing but speculation is gonna be a five thousand dollar minimum oh okay but i mean you you kind of thought that didn't you yeah this is like premium airfare unbelievable stuff this gets me excited i know i'm i'm a weirdo they got a cool promo video so are you do you feel the mock oh i feel why oh i feel the mark all the box i feel many months is there like a like a speed thing with your body or no so oh you gotta turn down the music probably i don't know i'm assuming you get turned out yeah check out the promo video they did like a music video like don't you want this jet um i believe you would feel it i mean since it's a commercial aircraft i presume they're going to ease into it will i don't think they're going to hit you with the mock all right away i don't think it's mach 2 straight up everyone passes out too many g's yeah i think they would be gradual with it but i think once you're at cruising i don't believe you would feel a difference you're flying at 60 000 feet by the way that's another thing you're capable of doing sixty thousand am i right about this i believe that's what i read yeah 60 000 feet 60 000 feet anyway these are expected to be rolled out in 2025 fly them in 2026 and then carry passengers in 2029. sweet this is still a little ways off but i find this to be quite exciting this stuff 71 feet long uh oh the full scale xb1 is 71 feet long full production model hopes to have how many passengers did it say uh oh by the way japan airlines one of the one of the companies interested and invested same with the virgin group so maybe after all uh branson's gonna be interested in these i was just i thought i saw how many people it could carry maybe not it wasn't a ton as you would expect because it isn't a huge jet one of those photos looks wild when you go scroll down to the one where it's like coming out of the hanger it just looks like an absolute rocket which is fun as far as i think that's really cool like it's so pointy man poke your eye out it's like look at this um i'm just looking for the passenger 88 passengers is what it will carry so obviously uh you gotta be spread out to have the accommodations that you saw in there yeah but uh what mynono had told me about the concord was it was no frills man inside of it it was nothing fancy and he did speak about getting knocked around a little bit but that was a different client it was a different era well he needed to go somewhere fast right that's all it needed to do actually i don't even think that's what it was about i think at the time he it was more like a it was almost like how people are doing the space tourism now it was kind of a thing of like oh you flew on a concord damn like it was a thing i mean he did go to europe or whatever like it was but it was also kind of a an experience if you had the money for it right and i guess he did but anyway this thing's out of commission but now with this boom this boom company boom super sonic it's happening again a little bit differently but happening again i got to tell you man once this thing comes like on the space one i'm a little uh like the space tourism that just goes up and comes back down for like i don't know what whatever price they're saying half a million dollars or something i'm not saying in this in the sense that i'm just trying to return on like the actual experience yeah it would be it would actually be kind of amazing you like the needle airplane it wouldn't know it would be cool to go to space it would be cool to go to space and see from up there but it's over very fast the experience as far as i can tell right isn't it a couple like an hour maybe okay and and it's just so expensive right now yes and people are lining up they're like i don't care i'm doing it and they're paying these these crazy amounts of money this if this is actually five grand and you can travel across the world and end up in where would you go your first flight i have no idea okay i'm assuming it's going to be very limited choices yeah i'm assuming it's going to be i mean the examples they gave like london probably would be one and sydney they mentioned i don't think it's going to there's not not enough jets to go everywhere with this their initial order is 15. so it probably would be london or something like that oh anyway i got all i got very excited about that one you did it's also called boom supersonic okay bitcoin yes bitcoin update elon did like a broken heart plus a bitcoin logo and uh and a meme uh and then bitcoin was down a little bit is bitcoin i don't know is it still down what's going on let's get to the bottom of it well it's what we do it's down a little bit down a little bit yeah maybe five percent yeah well whatever it's been it's been down and people still very upset with elon anyway he keeps tweeting about it and uh and people keep trying to interpret what he means he did the broken heart emoji alongside the token and people like okay is it over what's going on and then this kind of coincided with the 2021 bitcoin conference which is going on in miami right now i was going to be the star is that mine campaign holy cow very loud screaming at me over here yeah it's happening right now yes in miami a lot of notable people there many notables uh i heard uh mayweather is gonna do a talk there well he's in miami anyway yeah exactly yeah yeah but uh might as well double up ron paul michael saylor okay uh a few others uh tony hawk will be there you're in this crypto thing you know that well i was looking at the lineup for speakers yeah but you're still watching crypto content aren't you you're there yeah not that much yeah you are though well elon always brings it back you know with the tweets i'm just like okay what's gonna happen with the market now that he's tweeted right and then it goes all over again with the videos seemed like stressing you out well hey well you're not the only one because he's been the number one target at this bitcoin conference he's been blamed for price drops as you're well aware and uh there was even to open the thing there was a chant max kaiser host of the kaiser report began his fireside chat at the conference by repeating uh i'm not going to say the word actually but the the number one expletive and then elon's name several times and it was a chant wow and everyone was joining in and there's also been these uh this advertising these kind of billboards around miami stick to space elon sponsored by bitcoin is dot bitcoin is yeah bitcoin is.com learn more about bitcoin stick to space elon i don't know if you can find those billboards they're in the article if you want to show people but he's enemy number one as far as crypto's concerned here we have scott melker from also tweeted elon musk versus bitcoin 2021 in miami like he's a big target over there and i don't know man it seems like it seems like a really weird set of occurrences that he has become this villain now in this community which you would have presumed or at least just like moments before would have been number one fans like like i feel like there's a lot of tesla's at this event but maybe less than there would have been otherwise so yeah i feel like a lot of people were quote unquote betrayed by him betrayal being like thorough supporters of tesla yeah spacex and all that stuff but that'd be that that stings that betrayal one yeah because then internet betrayal because then it's like it's tough to fix it what do you have to do to fix it i don't even know he wants to fix it look like he's still goofing around but anyway he's the number one enemy at this bitcoin convention this is a cool one will you ever wonder why it is that an animal like a salamander can lose an arm or an organ and then just regrow it can they you didn't know that no that's right oh there's some species that they're just like oh my arm got i lost my arm i'll just grow it i'll grow another one it's incredible stuff very cool and what scientists are trying to do now is figure out what allows those species to do that and stops us from doing the same so you have some animals mammals like ourselves we get an injury lose a limb whatever we have scar tissue scarring that occurs and of course that scarring is going to shut down any opportunity for anything to regrow in that location yeah we can't do what the salamander those salamanders they don't scar they just get to work regrowing the lost limb team of scientists led by james goodwin phd of the mdi biological laboratory in maine has come a step closer to unraveling the mystery with the discovery of differences in molecular signaling that promote regeneration in the axe lodal that's the type of salamander they're looking at a highly regenerative salamander while blocking it in the adult mouse which is a mammal with limited regenerative ability so they play with mice as the mammalian substitute in order to determine these differences and see if they can amp up the molecular signaling in the mammal to behave in a similar fashion instead of regenerating loss or injured body parts mammals typically form a scar on the side of the injury scar creates a physical barrier to regeneration our research shows that humans have untapped potential for regeneration if we can solve the problem of scar formation we may be able to unlock our latent regenerative potential axolotls don't scar which is what allows regeneration to take place but once a scar has formed it's game over in terms of regeneration if we could prevent scarring in humans we could enhance quality of life for so many people wow so they feel that through well maybe eventually through some sort of external uh intervention that they could stimulate a similar scenario to what the salamander experiences and you could regen and by the way for this salamander it's not just limbs talking about organs like imagine people who have issues with i don't know kidneys or heart or it's crazy now i was reading this other part in here about human infants human infants can regenerate heart tissue and children can regenerate fingertips i didn't even know that really it's likely that adult mammals retain the genetic code for regeneration raising the prospect that pharmaceutical therapies could be developed to encourage humans to regenerate tissue and organs lost the disease or injury human infants can regenerate heart tissue i didn't know that and children can regenerate fingertips and i know that so we lost the like we like you and i lost the regenerative uh feature speak everybody speak for yourself uh well you got hair so you're regenerating hair so there's that um but this is a weird uh weird analogy with scar tissue it's like the fact that you like we need to cancel scar tissue in order to regenerate yeah and scar tissue probably like it obviously serves a purpose yes so therefore you're going to have to be monitored and you're going to need some other type of therapy in order to compensate for the fact that your body isn't scarring and they're trying to stop the scar from happening while simultaneously trying to encourage this other behavior similar to the salamander so i mean this is fringe stuff but i found it to be quite interesting yeah what if it doesn't stop what if you grow like more arms i don't think that's in the genetic code though that's the thing you're supposed to have it's linked to like in your dna it's latent in your code yeah my dude uh i don't know if you saw this one but there was um a chicken mcnugget which was shaped like the characters in among us and it recently sold on ebay for around a hundred thousand dollars because it looked so much like those little characters in among us you know with the two legs and the visor yeah the astronauts uh the crazy part was you know how i was talking about the bts meal which came with the nuggets this nugget was pulled from one of the limited edition meals as well [Music] if that means anything to you well this is interesting because this is obviously not a normal shaped nugget there are normal shaped nuggets like you have the boot you have the circle you have uh the other shapes i don't know what they are but they're i didn't even know that what you just said i didn't even know that yeah like you know uh when you look at a mcnugget it's a very specific distinct shape i don't even look at him yeah there's only like four shapes i eat the bts until the other day i didn't even look at them they were gone yeah so this is a such a weird anomaly because it's like formed into those shapes to make it like dippable it's all it's all a big science thing a single mcdonald's mcnugget that appears to resemble a character from the popular video game among us has become a very hot item on ebay bidding has reached 100 nearly 100 000 since the auction opened may 28th uh the seller explains that it is an authentic mcnugget found inside a mcdonald's bts meal uh the since it's a food product which has an average expiration of about 14 days it will be delivered prior to expiration so it's gonna be like frozen sealed up for shipping and uh one of the things that boosted the auction was the fact that the actual among us game twitter handle tweeted it out oh they made it official they made they they were the ones that said there's a 34 000 among us chicken nugget on sale i don't know how to feel about it but also i want it okay boot bone ball and bell yeah i never noticed this i mean they're not that different to be fair yes but they made it just different enough where there's like it's it's oh my god look at the next click over there i'm telling you no no no no the one the one with the chart fans favorite chicken mcnugget shapes the boot wins why aren't they all boots then 36 prefer the boot and only seven percent like the ball because they want to make it like distinct enough where it's a variety so yeah they're not all the same does it look as genetically modified but but in reality it's just like a different mold yes of the same stuff rolling off the assembly line anyway who do you think wants the hundred thousand dollar nugget though uh a big fan of among us and big nuggets so they're gonna just but how do you display it because it has to stay frozen so it doesn't yeah you're right um so it's in this sealed bag yeah i mean but come on you can do with that uh you can pour a plexiglass wouldn't that be against the rules though is it collectible like that i don't know i don't know either i don't know the rules on this but that's a hundred thousand dollar nugget right there um okay will before you scroll down on this next article i want to ask you it's trivia time are you ready how long ago did dinosaurs roam the earth hmm i mean i'm not asking for any a specific date yeah just roughly speaking a million years ago i'm way off aren't i how confident are you in that answer not very confident to be honest 10 million between 66 and 230 million years ago [Music] but you want to know something researchers researchers pulled 2 000 adults and discovered that 4 in 10 think that they existed between 2 000 and 10 000 years ago oh isn't it crazy how like we all know about dinosaurs dinosaurs are amazing yeah we all love dinosaurs but we really don't know that much about them we just look at it and they're like well that's cool that was a long time ago and then after a certain point we're just like i don't know it was a long time ago yeah they had feathers recently discovered they were birds yeah there's also other kinds of findings in here i mean the headline of the article is nearly half of americans think dinosaurs still roam the earth what what kind of dinosaurs in some remote corner of the world that's what but that's isn't that a jurassic park problem people saw jurassic park yeah that seems possible uh yeah 54 also believe that dinosaurs only lived in africa and north america unaware of the fact that their bones have been found all over the world more than 1 000 different species of dinosaur the typical adult can name just four with the tyrannosaurus rex being the most recognizable can you name more than four dinosaurs uh velociraptor okay that's a big second triceratops pterodactyl stegosaurus brontosaurus let's go uh that's all i know i think you win you win well i only had to hit four same dude i have one of my favorite christmas gifts i ever got when i was a youngster was a dinosaur book that's all i wanted yeah just just like one of those um kind of like a directory of dinosaurs oh okay you just scroll through and it's like has all the specs i i think one of the few video clips of myself as a youngster was walking around my grandparents house just gloating about my dinosaur body i got the dinosaur book dan look at my dinosaur book yeah so there's a a lot to be learned with dinosaurs apparently and people people need to do uh some more research obviously six in ten people agreed there was once a dinosaur called the do you think of do you think thesaurus do you think they saw us six in 10 people agreed really come on anyway this research is promoting a new series coming out june 1st a preschool animated series called dino ranch on disney junior right is that what they're gonna do yeah to celebrate national dinosaur day dino ranch dino ranch so i guess you want to learn about dinosaurs or get or have your youngsters answer these questions better than uh the majority of people then they can just load up on the dino ranch nearly half of americans think dinosaurs still were on the earth wow anyway i think your million is pretty good but by the way even though it was a lot more than that at least you were at the million mark sure yeah i think that was pretty good uh this next one very mysterious people on the internet are speculating that this may be evidence of time travel right here a painting from 1860 that appears to show an iphone do you see the iphone well uh yes so she's holding it and apparently texting looks like it yeah obviously it's not an iphone well obviously this is not evidence of any kind of time travel however it's fun it's a fun thing to imagine and to look at look at this guy i mean it's a weird painting he he obviously is interested in her and he's going to give her the flower right right right right right right right right right right she's only getting the shadows she must be it's probably like a prayer book or something yeah that's what i think yeah because they would carry something like that back then it's not the first time that a photo or an image like this has convinced people of time travel there's another one which actually i don't think is as good if you scroll down i think this one actually started it this is from 1629 or no 1670 and the dude there is apparently people thought he was holding an iphone every so often these stories probably what do you think about this painting in general though look at look look who's at the door there oh wow this is cool man man paintings are cool it's very surreal look at this painting yeah look at the spot that the woman is sitting in there nothing else around is she just sitting there all day like for how long does she have a puppy on her lap yeah it looks like it and then another dog in the foreground and the yeah the other person has just come through that door and there's a river out front i don't know where where they oh because they're in the netherlands are they i don't know i'm just seeing the the water waterway out front canal or something well it's definitely not a phone it's not illuminated anyway someone brought this particular painting up to tim cook and he said they said do you know when the iphone was invented and he was like i think so and then they're like no [Laughter] let me check check back on you no because they showed him this painting and he's like i don't know what i don't know anything anymore and he's like because obviously the guys he was playing along when they were goofing he was visiting a part of the world and they had their this artwork and he was playing along will okay he said i don't know maybe that was anyway yeah no there's no time travel i know i mean i know everybody wants to imagine such a thing but well maybe maybe one day figure that out oh here's a weird one i kind of like this one i've been getting a little more tennis news since i clicked on the what is naomi oh suck osaka i clicked on when she she bailed out on the tournament and it was a top trending story and i was curious about it and then now so my feed getting a little bit more tennis related stuff and one thing that has always struck me about the tennis situation is the relationship between the athlete and the judge have you ever witnessed any of this stuff they had like a weird dynamic they're always they're always here i guess in any sport you're irritated with the ref but this is a different it's only one guy there's not multiple refs to be mad at and it's super intimate like it's quiet you know how quiet it is at the tennis match compared to i don't know team sports it's kind of like golf a little bit louder than golf so there's been really high profile blow-ups and and arguments i think serene williams there was a couple of clips a while ago anyway this is a kind of a nothing argument but i love it so you can go ahead and play can you play it play a little bit of it and i'll explain what the what the dispute was about so this was a second round match and the guy in the white shirt there okay pause it pause it here he's talking to the to the judge right now and the judge is saying i don't want your bag there and he's saying my bag is always here and apparently by the way a lot of tennis players are very superstitious about the placement of their items and the judge is saying no that bag is too close to the line of the court and he's saying well it's not my fault you guys put the benches so close because normally the benches are further back play a little bit more of it because it's pretty close to the tram line but you can tell he's irritated here and he says i'm not moving and he basically just says no and the judge can't do it doesn't do anything about it yeah i mean it is crazy how close the chairs are at times the commentary yeah this i maybe i saw i'm trying to think of a movie was it was there a wes anderson movie with tennis in it i think so anyway it's just it's a funny there's something so intimate and they're mic'd up like you hear it all so well whatever their dialogue happens to be and uh it's not overboard not overly dramatic and it's also interesting that he can just not do it he's like no you should move them benches back then yeah and it's in the public because in other sports if you go at the ref like that like no i'm not going to do it that's not an option it's a penalty or whatever but here they just stop talking about it and the game goes on players are creatures of habit he said no i can't move it yeah i mean it is crazy how close the chairs are at times and everybody's watching yeah it's great i gotta go to one of these tennis events looks i i gotta have this experience at one time listening to the drama i don't know there's just something about it it's a whole it's its own thing what was the outcome uh with nothing he he left i don't know what happened in the game oh but he left it there so whatever the outcome was wasn't impacted by the presence of the thing because he got to keep it where he likes it the bag yeah now he gets into weird things on the internet the next one is even better and this one i didn't even give you the link because i didn't want to spoil the surprise have you been following the recent amc situation with the i didn't read it but you didn't read the link no i just started have you been following the amc situation like the stock prices go yeah i think i had amc stock when it was like around eight bucks or something i don't i don't have it now i got rid of it at some point along the way but it's been as high as like 50 bucks right uh 69 i believe wow it was high like a couple days ago so now it's around 40. okay anyway whatever it's become the meme stock like i guess gamestop is still there but people are having fun with amc you get the wall street bets and everything and the ceo of amc has been doing interviews and kind of you know they they got this fan base that they're trying to take advantage of rightfully so as you would and so recently he's doing an interview with a prominent youtuber and he sits down for the interview and it turns out he's got to he's got just click the link click the link click click the link will do you want me to read it read the headline uh amc ceo appeared to be pantless during a youtube interview he goes to do the interview without pants and then you wouldn't okay so you wouldn't know it because he's from the waist up and i know we've all done this i love this by the way but he's got a dress shirt and a tie and he's doing the interview yeah it's like an upshot slightly upshot okay so no problems and they're just very professional he's talking about the fundamentals he's saying amc's for real we got money like he he referenced a couple of reasons why uh it's worth somewhere between 20 and 25 per share is what you say that what it would amc's finances uh 239 million in cash it received from mudric capital to 500 million announced on thursday raised by selling 11.5 million shares like he was talking about real business stuff saying you guys are with the right squad right now but then the camera falls down at one point during the interview and and it shows his bare legs where the dress shirt ends and you can't tell i mean there's no there's probably underwear there but there's no shorts or anything yeah this side is hanging between the tie goes into the crotch area and it's a lot of thigh and i'm sitting here thinking isn't this perfect for the meme stock that the ceo who they call the silverback because they're all apes or whatever it is yeah they call this golfer he's the silverback and he does an interview without pants isn't that just perfect yes yeah that's great but the thing is now my mind is all screwed up because i'm like it is perfect but during the interview it was a camera falling but was it a camera falling i mean how hard is it to put pants on [Laughter] not very hard what do you mean though like the camera just no it was all staged i didn't say that i'm just saying i can't help but be like isn't it perfect that the meme stock with the silverback doing youtube interviews from his house gets a headline like this amc ceo pantsless during interview it's just perfect like i have filmed videos pantsless before and i don't have a clip online like that like mr memestock i don't know there's something i just love about it it's something that seems too good to be true and even the expression of the interviewer [Laughter] [Music] is uh his face uh it's very good anyway i don't know we'll see what it does for amc stock if it uh i would assume that the reddit crowd to wall street beds i would assume that they love this that's my guess yeah i feel like i want to buy more amc now because the guy's doing interviews pantsless but he's living up to the name but i'm a weirdo so i can't speak for everyone but amc makes sense right now only because people are getting back out there they want to go to the movies i mean i see it i get it i don't know if it's a 50 i don't think it's a 50 share but anyway yeah ceo don't need pants uh will do has a wild card today and i don't know what it is do i know what it is did we clear this i don't even remember now i'm blanking because the amc pantsless guy has me all flustered over here well when you gave me the stories i was asking you uh if you heard about this uh invisible oh yes yes yes yes yes yes yes i saw okay so i saw this uh get ready to be blown away ladies and gentlemen willy do wild card is back here you go okay so speaking of italy uh there's an artist who sold an invisible sculptor for eighteen thousand dollars and once you see the sculpture but wait why does the headline say twenty three thousand five hundred i believe this is like canadian oh or uh australian australian okay from the site oh okay like uh i got you us 18 000. so i picked this yahoo finance site specifically because it has some pretty awesome quotes about it so he was talking about explaining the actual sculpture but essentially the sculpture is right in the middle of this park area in italy and it's literally just taped off and it's like a five foot square that's taped off and there's nothing there and he calls it the buddha in contemplation yeah and uh he made this little video about it explaining where it is you do not see it but it exists it is made of air and spirit it's not even like aerial drone shots it's just him shooting activate the power of imagination and power that anyone has even those who don't think they have it what a weird production as well yeah it's black and white i think he has a gimbal at least at least or the stabilization on the camera is pretty good and he's just yeah he just walks away it's one of the weird artsy but i don't understand how do you just like wow how do you buy it though will because it's taped off like in a public street or something yeah it's kind of uh you just get a certificate yeah there's like a certificate of authenticity and uh i mean does it have any information about the buyer no no so there's no information but um people ask them about or ask this artist about you know what what it is and there's some just weird quotes rather than invisible sculptures i would define them as immaterial sculptures my fantasy train for a lifetime to feel differently the existing around me allows me to see what apparently does not exist let's see the vacuum is nothing more than a space full of energy and even if we empty it there is nothing left according to the heisenberg uncertainty principle that nothing has a weight he said therefore it has energy that is condensed and transformed into particles that is into us that's it it's just crazy i i don't know like this is this like the new form of nft or something i'm just really confused well you can't keep doing it that's a thing yeah like you can't sell the invisible sculpture multiple times he can't come back with invisible sculpture too can he i don't think so no i think look at the top comment on this instagram post i have the same sculpture in my home it's just crazy how an artist can do this and actually be certified and someone will actually buy it for a lot of money how do you how do we know [Music] how do we know that he didn't buy it he could have like or a relative or something and then tremendous notoriety yeah we're talking about it yeah 18 000 and you get the story goes around the world the invisible sculpture uh who buys it you can't do you don't get anything will yeah well it's invisible yes it is there's nothing transacted yeah you only get a certificate this actually makes nfts make sense sure yeah that's something that has pixels well you got something you're you got this uh you're on the blockchain at least they ain't no blockchain over here i don't know i don't know i don't know i'm gonna go finish my invisible sculpture right here if you have a better idea than doing this show [Music] you Samsung is tipped to launch the next-generation
Galaxy S22 series smartphone at the start of next year, but the rumors have already
started surfacing on the internet hinting toward the potential features. And today is yet another day of Galaxy S22
info, we have screen sizes of all the Galaxy S22 variants as well as the Unpacked event
details of the Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Z Flip 3. Also some surprising details about Xiaomi's
recently launched 200W charging technology. But first, let's talk about the S22. According to multiple credible sources, Samsung
will once again only offer the LTPO display on the Ultra variant. The S22 and S22+ will still get an LTPS display. For those unaware, LTPO is a better display
that can offer a variable refresh rate from 1Hz to 120Hz depending on the content being
shown thus saving battery life. Whereas in LTPS it's either fixed at 60Hz
or 120Hz. The display sizes of the S22 lineup are somewhat
similar to the S21 lineup. The Galaxy S22 Ultra will have a 6.8" display
identical to the S21 Ultra. The S22 Plus will have a 6.55" display which
is actually smaller than the S21+ which has a 6.7" display. And the S22 will have a 6.06" display which
again is a little smaller than the 6.2" display S21 offers. The screen resolution on these phones is still
a mystery for now. But expect it to be similar to the current-gen
products that's WQHD+ for Ultra, FHD+ for both the Plus and the vanilla Galaxy S22. Other known S22 features include a continuous
zoom camera, sensor-shift stabilization technology, and 4nm processors. The S22 lineup is likely to Skip the Under
Display Camera Even As Galaxy Z Fold 3 Tipped to Feature the Tech. Speaking about the Z Fold 3, we finally know
when Samsung is keeping their unpacked event for the handset as well as when it will be
available in stores. Max Winebach tweets that on August 3rd, 2
3s will be released with 2 4s as well. What he's saying is that Samsung will keep
the Unpacked event on August 3rd where they will unveil the Galaxy Z Fold 3 and the Z
Flip, along with the Galaxy Watch 4 and Watch Active 4. As for the release date, Jon Prosser reveals
that both the Z Fold 3 and the Z Flip 3 will be available in stores from August 27th onwards. Samsung usually keeps a two-week gap between
the launch and release dates but obviously, that is going to change this year. Now as for the Watch 4, these will go on sale
from August 11th onwards. With that said, remember the 200W charging
tech Xiaomi unveiled a few days ago, ever since everyone was asking how will this affect
the battery longevity? Well, we have some data from Xiaomi itself
to suggest some surprising results. Xiaomi says with 200W you can charge a 4000mAh
battery in just 8 minutes which is ridiculously fast, but Xiaomi claims that the battery will
not degrade any faster than a normal charging cycle. Xiaomi claims that after 800 charging and
discharging cycles, the overall battery life cycle will degrade to just over 80 percent
of its peak capacity. To put that into perspective, a typical battery
drops to 80% capacity after 500 cycles. So technically Xiaomi says their 200W hypercharge
actually offers more battery longevity than a typical normal smartphone charger which
sounds too good to be true. Xiaomi didn't say what sourcery are they using
to make it happen but unless a reputable third-party company test this time, I will have a hard
time believing it. Anyway, let me know what do you think about
this down in the comments and as always I'll see you tomorrow...peace out hey guys ebpman here now this is the next video that you all have requested and this time we're looking at the sony 1000xm4s compared to the samsung galaxy buds pro we're going to do an ebp man style call quality tests we're going to do audio tests we'll compare all the features so you can see which one sounds the best and which one performs the best when it comes to call quality as well as some of the other features as well so let's go ahead and check them out now from a battery perspective both of these earbuds do extremely well and they're very close but the sony does leap ahead in one specific area first of all both of these are going to give you eight hours of usage the difference though is that that's eight hours of usage with active noise canceling on this is the big deal when you turn off active noise canceling this blows up to 12 hours of usage so really they have superior battery life than you have over here with the samsung galaxy buds pro from a charging perspective though from a case you're looking at 24 hours with the case over here you're looking at 28 hours you both have five minutes give you a fast charge of one hour usage so both of them do really well in that area now from a bluetooth perspective you have 5.0 versus 5.2 so sony does have the newer bluetooth signal or or i would say version but both of them are going to perform well when it comes to syncing of music and audio and all those things so you really don't have to worry about you know the differences aren't that significant now from using them independently both of them can be used independently as well so if you want to be able to have one in your ear and one out of your ear you have no problem there either now the other thing is that both of these support 3d high definition audio so you have really great audio experiences but it really comes when the samsung it's really tied to the samsung ecosystem so you have to have a newer version of the phone in order to be able to support that 3d hd audio both of them have auto pause capabilities and both of them have active noise cancelling even though this one has a couple levels that they highlight really there's no competing sony just does a better job when it comes to active noise canceling from a fit perspective and a passive noise canceling they both do fantastically well now from our transparency mode and i'm going to talk about auto transparency mode and then standard transparency mode auto transparency mode they both perform really well that means as soon as you start talking it kind of stops the music or whatever's going on so that you can hear what's going on around you they both perform really well but samsung has what i would consider super hearing when it comes to transparency mode so if you do suffer from any kind of hearing impediment this may or may not help all i would say is that you do have a boost mode in this which amplifies and there's actually an extra setting inside of the app that allows you to boost it even further so this one is much louder than this one this one sounds a little bit more natural though but it's not as loud now from my perspective you do have two mics with the bone conduction sensor that's supposed to increase or improve audio quality when you're speaking and then on this side what you have is three mics but we're going to see in the call quality test how well they compare now from an ipx rating perspective yeah samsung takes it you have an ipx version of seven versus an ipx version of four now from a case perspective the samsung galaxy buds pro really have the sony beat uh really from a size perspective super small and compact so i really like the size here i prefer that over the sony both of these use usbc for charging both of them have wireless charging and both are going to keep your earbuds securely inside of the case so they're not going to fall out and they're both magnetically guided now each of these earbuds has a different look to it and it also has a different feel so if you look at these the actual galaxy buds pro are much smaller they do have the same contact points they have sensors they have all that jazz going on there but you can see the size difference is significant the other thing is from a weight perspective also there's a significant difference these are extremely much more lighter and they have similar gels right this one has more of like comply foam this one has a silicone but it does have some squishiness to them as we put these on so you can see what they look like when i put this one right here and then i'm gonna put this one on here really the uh the samsungs are you know they're just much more low profile so you can see right here how it disappears when i'm looking just straight ahead and how the the other one's just the sony's just stand out because they're so much larger i'm going to turn to each side so you can see the difference so if i were to say which one do i prefer from a fit perspective i'd really prefer the uh the samsung samsung's low profile disappear and you can see as i turn my head a little bit to the left to the right you just can't tell that they're there uh because also they're smaller you know they tend to really feel nice and you can notice how flush they are so they get for me just in my ear better and they just feel overall better than you have with the the sonys themselves but keep in mind that doesn't mean that the sony's are not comfortable it's just that as you're comparing them you can see the big difference so guys the next thing we want to talk about is audio quality what was my experience well we talked about active noise canceling i do think that the samsung galaxy buds do a great job for active noise canceling but the sony's really have the superior so they're going to be the the ones to beat the one area also as we talk about audio there's really a big difference you're going to hear this in the audio track take a close listen because the mics are capturing the difference the the sony's sound loud they're bright there's some bass there but they're not as they're a little bit more on the bright side the actual sony's have a fuller sound it's just more throatier so everything just sounds more immersive so i would give them a little bit more broader of a sound stage so for those of you who are really looking for superior audio experience then this is going to give you that superior audio experience and it just slightly you know the the samsungs are just you know not there so that is going to really depend on your hearing preference and what you can pick up but again i give it to the sony's when it comes to audio as well you look at me like i'm crazy when i shut my feelings out you look at me like i'm different still [Music] i [Music] [Music] you look at me like i'm crazy when i shut my feelings out you look at me like i'm different still you stick with you feel something real get so lost in my moments [Music] [Applause] i fell in love with the colors they kind of tell me what i'm thinking [Applause] [Applause] hey [Music] peace [Music] now next we're going to do a call quality test of the samsung galaxy buds pro in a quiet environment if you take a look at our decimal readings anywhere between 22 and 28 decibels of noise it's going to switch now this is what the call quality will sound like making a phone call on the samsung galaxy buds pro in a quiet environment this is a test one two three this is our test now we're going to add some wind to the environment now this is what the galaxy buzz pro sound like if you had wind in the environment this is what they would sound like if there was wind in the environment now next we're testing out the samsung galaxy buzz pro if you were wearing a face mask so this is what they would sound like if you had a face mask on now we're in a much noisier environment and you can see that our decimal readings are anywhere between 39 and all the way up to 80 something decibels in noise what we're going to do is switch over to the samsung galaxy buds pro and stay quiet for a little bit and see how much is cancelled now this is what the samsung galaxy dodge pro sound like in the noisy environment this is the task one two three this is our attack we're continuing our test of the samsung galaxy buzz pro but this time with an infinite crying in the background this is what they sound like if it was crying in the background now if you're worried about what the samsung galaxy buds would sound like with a dog barking in the background this is what they would sound like if a dog were barking in the background now if you're wondering what they sound like if a doorbell was to ring in the background and you're in a call this is what they would sound like if there's a doorbell ringing now next we're going to do a call quality test of the sony 1000xm4s in a quiet environment let's take a look at our decimal readings anywhere between 20 and 20 decibels of noise let's go to switch now this is what the call quality will sound like making a phone call on the sony 1000xm4 is in a quiet environment this is a test one two three this is our test now we're going to add wind to the environment this is what the sony 1000xm4 sound like in a windy environment this is a test one two three this is the test this is what the sony 1000xm4 soundlight in a windy environment now we're continuing our test of the sony 1000xm4 but this time with the face mask on this is what they sound like with the face mask on now we're continuing our audio test because this time in a noisy environment as you can see by our decimal readings we have anywhere between 40 and 78 decibels of noise what we're going to do is we're going to switch to the sony 1000xm4 so we stay quiet and then we're going to continue to record the audio coming from the voice just to see how much is being canceled out let's go to the switch now this is what the call quality would sound like making a phone call with the sony 1000xm4s in a noisy environment this is our test 123. this is our test now we're continuing our test of the sony 1000xm4 but with an infant crying in the background this is what they would sound like with an infant crying in the background we're continuing our test of the sony 1000xm4 but this time with a dog barking in our background this is what they would sound like if a dog were barking in the background now we're continuing our test of the sony 1000xm4s but with the doorbell ringing in the background this is what they would sound like if the doorbell was ringing in the background so guys that wraps up our comparison review between the samsung galaxy buds pro and the sonys see in the next one [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] you so it really feels like there are two types of flagship phones nowadays you've got one type where the company's kind of decided eh phones are capable enough already let's focus on design or software or marketing but then you've got the other type who are like screw that we're putting everything in it enter the me11 ultra this isn't trying to be a good phone it's trying to be the best phone money can buy the box is nothing special but also more importantly nothing's missing it comes with a usbc to headphone jack adapter the standard clear case and below the phone we get a usbc charging cable and a 67 watt fast charger let's get one thing out the way not everyone is going to like the way this looks i've showed the m11 ultra to seven eight people now and the reactions have ranged from that's the coolest phone i've ever seen to why are those so big to it kind of looks like it's trying to take over the world and i think the reason it's so polarizing is that this is confident design it's not trying to be a halfway house it's not trying to please everyone it knows what it wants to look like in this case a technological behemoth and it's running with it the mi 11 ultra openly leaves elegance and sophistication at the doorstep in place of an i eat samsung's for breakfast type aesthetic and i think it works it proudly flaunts its specs the lenses are enormous the camera module itself takes up a literal quarter of the phone and it actually isn't as much of a nuisance as i was expecting it to be yes it collects dust you can probably see some up top here but because the camera module doesn't stretch down that much it's surprisingly out the way of fingers and because it's so wide instead of worsening the wobble problem like a lot of these big cameras do it solves the wobble problem also this is not glass they've actually ditched it in place of ceramic which is often considered to be v-pro material but i'm not actually completely sold on that i think i just prefer the convenience of matte glass versus fingerprint city over here and this phone was already going to be heavy the density of ceramic pushes it further into one of the heaviest phones i've ever used it's not been an issue for me but it has been for some of the people who i've handed it to and god help whoever accidentally drops this on their face one night but more importantly is what this phone does when i first started using the mi 11 ultra i laughed because after months of phones that just could not match the samsung galaxy s21 ultra and who each deserve to cement how special of a phone that is all of a sudden we have a device that isn't just trying to trade blows and be comparable xiaomi is trying to kill samsung so i'm going to show you how and then i'm going to tell you why to preface this whole thing though they're about the same price aka a lot of money okay have a look at the s21 ultra's display i feel like the word phenomenal gets thrown around a lot but i can't think of many things more deserving of that title in fact samsung's phones have had such good screens that it's kind of just become a bit of a tradition that every time they release a new s-series phone that becomes the best display of the year until their own note series phone comes six months or so later and improves on it so it's pretty cool that i can sit here and say xiaomi's me 11 series of phones break that cycle ironically using a samsung made panel these are both a plus 6.8 inch amoled quad hd plus 120 hertz gorilla glass vectors hdr 10 plus adaptive panels how many times did i just say plus but xiaomi's is even brighter maxing out at 1700 nits instead of 1500 making it the brightest phone display possibly ever it's got a 480 hertz sample rate versus 240. that's how fast it's scanning for touches it doesn't have that slight blue shift as you tilt the phone and xiaomi can display 10-bit colors versus samsung's 8-bit it's not actually a 10-bit panel but it uses a technology that simulates having a greater color depth it is also quad curved so it slopes off on both the top and the bottom as well as the left and the right i guess to make gestures feel a little more seamless but equally because the only bits that aren't now curved at the corners i can't shake the feeling that my phone just looks like it had a really bad haircut more fundamentally though xiaomi has two amoled displays so you might have heard of the me band 5 their last generation activity tracker they basically taken the screen of that and slapped it on the back of this phone and on one hand this little thing doesn't really do much that we've not already seen before from those proper dual screen phones but a it's still impressive that it can do many of those same things whilst only actually being a side feature instead of the primary gimmick and b by having it on this phone in particular it enables something that that i think has the potential to be a complete game changer but i'm getting there it does also have an amazing customization suite you can have the time and inspirational quote you can have your face on there but it's just strange that they've made it so that it turns itself off after 30 seconds maximum because am i ever actually going to keep my phone screen down just so that i can check the time by fiddling around to try and double tap this mini display on the back to wake it probably not but yeah providing you're okay with the bunny ear corners i think xiaomi's killed it with the display but what about battery because the fact that the s21 ultra has got 5 000 milliamp hours of the stuff it's just meant that i stopped thinking about it and that's a good thing it's not like we ever get positive battery reminders like congratulations you're still on 90 so the less that the battery is on your mind the better the battery is doing its job and using this same scale xiaomi goes further because it charges faster and i've said this before faster charging is not necessarily a good thing it can degrade the battery it can mean they've got to split one cell into multiple cells giving you a lower overall capacity but they've kind of done fast charging here in a way that circumvents its main drawbacks like you're still getting the same 5000 milliamp hours of capacity and roughly the same six hours of screen on time in a normal day with all settings maxed out but instead of having a thicker battery to enable that fast charging we've actually got a thinner battery thanks to apparently new materials and as for how much faster it charges well instead of 70 minutes on the s21 ultra i'm getting 40 on xiaomi and while with xiaomi you can also charge roughly at the same speed wirelessly too that takes 120 on the samsung or three times longer now you might know that i'm not a huge wireless charging advocate and you would have to specifically buy xiaomi's proprietary wireless charger to get those speeds but it's tough to argue in samsung's direction here even though in all sensors its charging is slower they still don't give you a charging brick xiaomi does oh before i forget i did check my stats the other day and 49 of you watching are subscribed 51 of you aren't so if you are enjoying this video then a sub to the channel would be electrifying let's try and tip that balance okay you're probably starting to notice a theme here it really feels like with the mi 11 ultra xiaomi has taken samsung's phone as a template and then literally tried to one-up it in every aspect even its speakers sound basically the same just a tiny bit louder which is subtle but it's actually just enough of a difference for this phone to be one of the few that can pass the shower test i.e can i take it to a shower and still clearly hear the voices in a video that i'm watching xiaomi's even made it a faster phone i run the latest antutu benchmark five times back to back and you'll notice a few things firstly that xiaomi's display does start dimming itself extremely quickly and you can't turn the brightness up yourself when it does that but also that in every benchmark xiaomi is very clearly ahead and this is against the better performing snapdragon version of the s21 ultra xiaomi does reach a higher internal temperature but it doesn't seem to affect its ability to sustain performance can i tell the difference when playing normal android games no not really but i can imagine that anyone who's looking to buy an ultra phone will probably appreciate the extra three months or so of future proofing that you might get with higher overheads like that besides while both phones do come by default with 12 gigabytes of fast lpddr5 ram xiaomi comes with twice the fast ufs 3.1 storage here's the big news though the number one thing that has kept samsung in the lead is its cameras i'll link my last comparison using it up here but the crux of it is that samsung's combination of reliability and versatility are currently uncontested till now see it's easy to look right past the mi 11 ultra cameras okay not that easy they're half the size of my face but the point is it's only three cameras we've got four on the oneplus 9 pro and that's not exactly considered top tier but the thing with these three cameras is that each of them is extremely specialized like this main camera has the largest sensor that we've ever seen on a smartphone almost 20 bigger than samsung's already enormous sensor and this means three things one incredible separation of foreground and background it's not day and night over the samsung but it's taking great and making it better two more light if you go into a super dark environment you will find that its shots look cleaner than the s21 ultras and three cinematic video this is really more of a byproduct of the background blur but the point is the benefits of it are far-reaching as you can probably see i could spend a long time talking about this camera system because there is so much going on but the high level summary is this for the most part the xiaomi mi 11 ultra cameras trade blows with samsung this thing can shoot 8k video on all three of its lenses even if that is more for bragging rights than anything practical it's slow motion is not just twice as slow but better quality and its ultrawide camera is supremely wide noticeably more than that of its counterparts but samsung's colors are more consistent and for my tastes better xiaomi just takes too many liberties with it and so sometimes shots look spot-on and then other times i'm like wait did i do something wrong xiaomi can often crush darker areas and whilst having this enormous sensor does mean bright nighttime shots and beautiful blurred backgrounds in most night scenarios i wouldn't really say it's better and its plane of focus is so narrow that it can sometimes also mean that part of your foreground is blurred samsung has better macro shots with xiaomi's macro mode barely able to focus closer than its main camera and for now at least it's still the zoom champion and to be honest it's far enough ahead that it kind of makes xiaomi zoom feel a little misleading because i mean technically any camera can be any zoom i want it to be i could pull out a passion fruit and okay not that i could pull out an iphone 4 and zoom in 200 times if i wanted to i'd only be seeing like two pixels but the point is xiaomi marketing their phone as a 120 times makes it sound like it's better than samsung's 100 times when actually all they've really done is been more flexible with their definition of a quality photo or in other words to get the same quality image that samsung can get at 100 times this can only really get to about 60. so that's what it should have been labeled as based on 2021 expectations of quality however there's one wild card one thing that is both eureka moment genius and punch yourself in the face frustrating xiaomi second screen allows you to use all three of these main high-end cameras for the front too so while with most phones you're stuck with a single b-grade camera for selfies with the xiaomi phone you get the entire rig so you can take face shots with not just the largest sensor you can get on a phone right now this might just be the highest definition i've ever seen myself in but also the ultra wide camera which compared to how narrow most front-facing cameras are feels extraordinarily wide you get unprecedented low-light performance and crazy zoom too if you wanted that but because of how it's configured you can't take portrait mode shots with this it doesn't really work in social apps and the only way to take video is through a bit of a workaround and it's capped at 15 seconds it's 15 glorious seconds don't get me wrong but why would xiaomi limit it like this why would xiaomi spend all that money designing one of the greatest phone camera systems ever spend all that time developing and improving these software modes give you that second screen to be able to utilize them on the front but then prevent you from doing that everything's in place the hardware is here the software's here you just can't and so whilst this would have been a tipping point for me this probably would have been enough for me to say okay i think xiaomi's created a better camera system than even samsung as things stand it's about a draw siding slightly with the s21 ultra because the actual front-facing camera on the mi 11 ultra that you will end up using for a lot other things it's pretty meh i did talk to a xiaomi rep about this and she said that they're pushing for these features internally so fingers crossed but i can only review what's actually been confirmed and delivered however as you can see from this very rough tally we've been keeping xiaomi has kind of won and that's amazing the galaxy s21 ultra was the phone to beat and it's now beat but i'm also not in the least bit surprised by this result because i'm convinced that the only reason this mean 11 ultra exists is to beat the s21 ultra it's as if the entire philosophy behind it was to match every specification and then go further wherever they realistically could oh you've got a 6.8 inch amoled screen with a 1440 by 3200 resolution so do we but ours is brighter oh you've got a five thousand million power battery capacity would you look at that so do we but ask charges faster you've got 960fps super slow motion well that's cute we've just doubled that you zoom 100 times we zoom 120. you get the idea this is why my review of the xiaomi phone has basically just been a comparison to the samsung but why why is this phone so squarely targeted at them the answer is huawei two years ago huawei was exploding huawei was breaking boundaries they were on track to become the smartphone superpower of the world but then the us ban happened and as soon as the implications of that and no google services started to come into effect huawei fell and that's left xiaomi with the surprising opportunity to scoop up this enormous chunk of the market that huawei is leaving behind to become the global number one their only obstacle being the more established samsung who's trying to do the same thing and so all xiaomi needs to do is to make sure that they're doing what samsung's doing but either cheaper or better and by most metrics it's working apart from camera zoom which i feel like is mislabeled here the byproduct of xiaomi's targeted approach is that of course you're going to end up with an even higher end even more extreme phone i know some people don't like xiaomi's miui software skin but this is android providing you can put aside like 20 minutes you can just uninstall all the bloatware and you can set up your home screen pretty much how you want it it wouldn't make sense for me to say don't buy this phone because i have mixed feelings about me wise icons the important things are that it's fast which it is it's stable which it has been completely bug-free and ad-free in my experience and that you get good software support which you generally do with xiaomi flagships you'll probably get two years of major android updates and then quite possibly four years of me ui and security updates i've talked about miui a lot in my past xiaomi reviews so i'll link one of them up here but fundamentally if i would summarize it in like one word i would say options there is so much you can do in miui like even just the display settings are nuts you've got sunlight mode for really bright scenarios anti-flicker modes sliders for color temperature and even screen texture you can actually turn it into a paper-like experience if you wanted to so yeah me 11 ultra this is the new benchmark but i do think the galaxy s21 ultra still does enough things better that both have a place samsung has a more sophisticated aesthetic and i'd argue a nicer finish it's fingerprint scanner is not just faster in detection but also more forgiving and i would still say that this has the more reliable camera system okay subscribe if you enjoyed thank you so much for watching my name is aaron this is mr who's the boss and i'll catch you in the next you So this is the Samsung Galaxy A52... 4G. (laughs) Hey guys. It's your Tech Girl, Mary! And welcome back to my channel.
As promised, I will buy the Samsung A52 
for you guys to have an idea if you should
get the phone or not as usual. I also have the Samsung Galaxy A72
as you guys saw from the intro, 
but in a separate video. Let's first do this one
that's more affordable. This is the Samsung 
Galaxy A52 in blue. This is also available in black
and in white. And for the Samsung Galaxy A52 5G, that one guys only has
black as the available color. The name of its colors
are very interesting— awesome black,
awesome blue, and awesome white. The Samsung Galaxy A52 4G
retails for Php18,990. And if you guys want
to opt for the 5G variant, that one retails for Php23,990. Good news... although
this video is not sponsored by Samsung or by Lazada,
I just want to share that the new A series will be
on sale on the birthday sale of Lazada, that's why
I wanted to release this video already for others to be aware
that there'll be a sale incoming on March 27. To those who are new to my channel, I usually don't just miss 
the Samsung A series on my channel. We have the Samsung Galaxy A50,
Samsung Galaxy A51, and here we are,
the Samsung Galaxy A52, Samsung's most popular
and best-selling midrange device. (entertainment music) Same packaging like before.
It has a smaller box inside. We have the poking tool
or the SIM ejector tool. Jelly case that has kind
of a tint on it. Paperworks. The phone itself. The color blue is so good, right? The power brick. Our USB Type-C charging cable. Nothing more. (laughs) We don't have any earphones. So what are the things
that you should expect on this smartphone?
Of course, there are its main features which are the Infinity-O display,
a quad-camera setup that has 64MP with OIS, and an IP67 water 
and dust resistance. (entertainment music) Finally, I've revealed 
and unboxed the device. This will literally be
a first impression guys, and it's amazing. You know the feeling
that it's like very different from A50 and from the A51. They really did change
their design language this time. It's very different 
from its predecessor which is one of the many reasons
why you should upgrade from your A50 and A51. This is if design matters to you. If I were to describe, guys,
its finish, it's very similar to those flagships of Samsung
that are the S21. It's got this kind
of like a powder matte finish, but it's not the kind of matte
that is a smudge magnet. Because for example, in my case,
I have sweaty hands, it will still definitely stick,
but it won't look bad anymore if we compare it
to the glossy back finish that we have on its predecessors. Although it's still made 
of plastic, it's kind of, you know, the A series
always use plastic. I don't see anything wrong
with that, because we're still in the same price segement
so it's understandable. It's just kind of a pity,
I'm just hurt guys, because there's no purple
that is available in our country, the Philipppine. So design wise, 
I approve this one, 10/10. And aside from its finish,
they also change the camera setup. Aside from that, I also love
that it's lightweight. It weights 189g. I really thought at first
that it's above 200g, because I was saying
that the device is kind of thick. And aside from that,
probably the biggest or additional feature
that you guys might want for a smartphone,
is the additional IP67 water and dust resistance of it. Now, what does it mean?
It doesn't mean guys that you can submerge
the device in the pool or in the beach.
This is also rare if you were to ask me, for the smartphones
that I've reviewed, that it's kind of rare
for midrange devices to have this kind of feature. It can get wet from the rain,
it can be splashed with water, or when you're eating 
and it accidently got splashed by a small amount of water, your Samsung Galaxy A52
will still be safe. On the top is where you can find
the microphone, SIM tray that is dual SIM
and expandable via microSD card. On the right, 
there is its volume rocker and the power button. On the left part it's clear.
We don't have anything on it. And then, below we have
the headphone jack, another microphone,
USB Type-C port, and its speaker grill. (entertainment music) So here is the display. If I won't mention to you
the specs that we have for the display, if you'll notice it, there's some kind of changes.
Its side bezels are actually thinner
including its chin on the bottom. Of course, it's on the bottom
since it's the chin. Anyway, it has 6.47 inches
of Full HD+ with 90Hz refresh rate
with Super AMOLED display. And as a result, 
browsing through the UI, it's so smooth. 
It's kind of refreshing, because you know,
the A series stayed and had a regular 60Hz ever since. Even the 90Hz became 
popular last year, they were still on 60Hz.
And I'm glad that they already adopted that. Now, if you don't feel
like the 90Hz screen refresh rate is enough for you guys,
we have the A52 that is 5G variant
that has 120Hz of screen refrest rate which is I know it's amazing,
because I thought that the only improvement
is its chipset. Having a 120Hz screen refresh rate is a very flagship-like spec. So yeah, its 5G variant
is also impressive. Now, how about
the screen protection? It has the Corning Gorilla Glass 5
for the front, and again, on the back
it doesn't have any since it's only plastic. So far the display is enjoyable.
Its peak brightness can reach up to 800nits,
so viewing content even outdoors won't have
any problem. Aside from that, it also comes with a Widevine L1 certification. So when watching on Netflix
or any other streaming channels, you can watch movies on HD. Aside from that, 
it's also impressive that the Samsung Galaxy A52
has a stereo setup. And since we have 
a Super AMOLED display here, expect that it will have
an Always-On Display and an in-display 
fingerprint sensor. For the in-display 
fingerprint sensor guys, honestly, as expected... You know that in the A51
and A50, I kind of had a problem that their in-display 
fingerprint sensor is kind of slow. With this one, it got kind of fast, but there are still times
that it'll have delays, so it's not that consistent. That's why this time,
there's an option for a face unlock, but it's kind of a hassle
since we have a face mask guys when we're outside. So you know, 
I can't help but to look for a side-mounted
fingerprint sensor since that always work faster. (entertainment music) Now for the performance,
this Samsung Galaxy A52 4G variant has the Snapdragon 720G
that has an 8nm processor with Adreno 618 GPU. And if you are curious
what chipset was used on the Samsung Galaxy A52 5G, that one has 
the Qualcomm Snapdragon 750G with Adreno 619 GPU. Actually, if we were to compare
the AnTuTu score of the Samsung Galaxy A52
from its predecesors that are in Exynos 9611, based on what I remember,
it didn't reach 200,000 on their AnTuTu benchmark scores. While this Samsung Galaxy A52,
it scored for around 260,000 which is a major improvement. So it increased by a lot
from, again, its predecessor. So far, you know,
I had a great experience with the Samsung Galaxy A52.
Although, there are smartphones that are recently released
right now that is also in its same
price segment that has a higher chipset, so the competition
is actually kind of tough for this month of March. And I know you're having 
a hard time in choosing. I know that so I'll help you guys
on our future videos on which one is really
worth it to buy. And of course, since my time with the A52 is kind of limited, 
I haven't really played games on this smartphone, so just wait for it 
in our future videos. Anyway, the variant
that I have here is the 8GB of RAM that has 256GB 
of internal storage. (entertainment music) Another good news
is that the Samsung Galaxy A52 runs the latest One UI 3.1
based on Android 11. (entertainment music) Now, let's talk about its cameras. Actually, it has four camera.
It just looks like it has five since we have a flash. We have a 64MP 
primary camera with OIS, a 12MP ultrawide camera, a 5MP depth sensor,
and a 5MP macro lens. Just a quick trivia,
the smartphones that are in this price segment,
we only usually have EIS which is the 
Electronic Image Stabilization, on this price segement, but Samsung opted
to use OIS which is the Optical Image Stabilization, which is much better
and I will always choose OIS over EIS any day. But do take note that this is only 
in the primary sensor, Although we can shoot videos
using the ultrawide camera, it won't be as stable
if we were to compare it when using the main camera. Lastly, for the front camera,
actually this one didn't improved that much.
It's still 32MP for the front. But I do think the quality
of the photos is so much better 
than the last time. Anyway, if you guys want
to see our sample photos, these are the latest shots taken
by this smartphone since I just got the device. I'll be flashing them 
after this clip. (entertainment music) Lastly, for its battery guys,
before I end our video... It has 4,500mAh
of battery capacity with supported 25W fast charging, which is actually
a nice upgrade if we were to compare it with its predecessor that has 4,000mAh
of battery capacity. And if you'll remember guys,
its predecessor only has 15W fast charging. That's what we call an upgrade. But on other countries,
although it supports 25W fast charging,
the one included in its box is only a 15W power brick. And same in our country,
only a 15W power brick is included in the box. So if you have a 25W
in your house, then you might want
to use that in this phone. For me, if you'll ask me guys,
it did upgrade. Actually, the upgrades
that we have on the Samsung Galaxy A52
are very healthy from its predecessor. The upgrades are very noticeable, it's already evident even just
from the design. But, if again we'll compare it
to the other brands, it's already a different topic. So on our review video,
I'll also give you some alternatives. Of course, it's also interesting
to see how this Samsung Galaxy A51
compete from its competitors. Anyway, thank you guys again
for watching my Samsung Galaxy A52 unboxing 
and first impressions video. It'll be again on sale
In Lazada on March 27 on their birthday sale. See you guys on my 
Samsung Galaxy A72 unboxing and first impressions. Bye guys! Hello guys! So Samsung has 
a new budget phone again. Hey guys! It's your Tech Girl, Mary. And welcome back to my channel. I'll just sit for now guys
because I got tired of always standing. Yes, guys. If you follow me
on my social media accounts, I'm always standing in all
of my videos and it sometimes lasts for an hour or if gets too long,
it's sometimes 1 1/2 hours. It's tiring, right? So now we're going to sit
because it's really very tiring. Samsung Galaxy A10, 
Samsung Galaxy A10s, and this time, 
this is their new budget device, the Samsung Galaxy A12. This is not an entry-level smartphone, but it's definitely 
Samsung's new budget device. So it's really like
the Samsung month right now guys. (entertainment music) Obviously, what I have guys
is the color blue and it is also available
in other colors. It also has white. I think that's the one that was reviewed by Liz, Liz Tech. Hello, Liz Tech! It's also available in black,
and I think there's also a red one. I purchased this guys, on Lazada. And I got it for Php9,990,
because the variant that I bought is the highest variant
which is the 6GB of RAM with 128GB of internal storage. Opening the box,
it comes with a smaller box. And inside, I feel like 
this has no jelly case guys. Yep. We're right. Quick start guide and we also
have a warranty card. Then, this is our phone itself,
the Samsung Galaxy A12. Fast charging power brick. A USB Type-C to USB Type-A
charging cable. Earphones. And its very thin poking tool,
the SIM ejector tool. There. I now look like
a beauty guru. It's so corny. (giggles) So guys, that's the things
included in the box of the Samsung Galaxy A12. It's complete, except for the
free jelly case. So, yup. That's it 
for today's video guys. I hope you enjoyed
our very quick unboxing. Is that okay? (giggles) I'll just repeat it.
The reason it's Php9,990 is because the one that I bought
is the 6GB of RAM with 128GB of internal storage. If you want a more affordable one, it has a 4GB of RAM variant
that retails for Php7,990 on Lazada. (entertainment music) So, Samsung Galaxy A12. You know what, Samsung changed. For the past two years
where we had the A series, if you'll notice, 
it looks like glass, but it's plastic or as they call glasstic,
and it has a glossy back finish that has a rainbow effect
on its back. This time, Samsung changed it. Its design doesn't look like
an A series anymore. It's like... We know guys and we can distinguish
if it's an A series. But now, since they changed 
the design, you'll see it more 
and you'll notice it more what smartphone is the latest. This time guys,
it's not glossy back finish anymore and I'm very happy with that. It's textured. It's got these like small dots
here on its back somewhere on the top, making it more easier to hold,
because it has this kind of texture so the grip is better. But it's not textured all throughout
because it its bottom is smooth, without having any texture, but it's not a glossy back finish. It's still got a matte finish
to show there the branding of Samsung. Aside from that, it also has
a square camera setup, which is very different from old Samsung A series budget device, with a LED flash,
and we don't have a fingerprint sensor on the back anymore. It's very clean-looking now. On top it has a microphone. On the right side 
is its volume rocker. And it also has a power button guys
that doubles as a fingerprint sensor. On the left part you can
see the SIM tray guys. And don't worry, it's dual SIM. You can put two 4G LTE SIM card
and one microSD card. And lastly, below it has
a headphone jack and another microphone,
USB Type-C charging cable, and the speaker grill. Anyway, I didn't have any problems
on its fingerprint sensor. I actually liked it more 
than before where it's always located on the back. To be honest, 
it's now more consistent and more accurate unlike
in the past A series budget device. Guys, before we talk 
about its display, I just noticed something
on this device while I'm using it 
in the past few days. It's a budget phone
that's kind of heavy actually, and it's also kind of thick. And to be exact, it weighs 205g with a 8.9mm thickness. And of course, 
this is a budget device, it's made of polycarbonate plastic
and even its frame. So, yup. That's everything
that you need to know guys for its overall physical appearance. Let's now talk about its display. (entertainment music) To be honest, I'm very okay
with its new design that Samsung made. I'm just kind of disappointed
on its display. It's got a 6.5'' IPS LCD panel
that has a 720x1600 pixels resolution. So obviously, it only has
an HD+ resolution. And for the price that I paid
for this smartphone, again being Php9,990, it's kind of not fair. To be honest, if you're going
to buy a smartphone on other brands that has
the price of Php10,000, you'll be able to buy one
that has 6GB of RAM and also has Full HD+ resolution. Again guys, display is what
we see first or what we first notice
on a smartphone. That's why it's important
that even if it's a budget device, as much as possible,
it should be Full HD+. But anyway, for a Samsung display, it's fine. It still has accurate colors.
There are just times that it's lacking on its brightness, especially under direct sunlight,
because again, that's what IPS displays
can only give. Also if you'll notice guys,
it's already 2021, but we still have a notch here
on the Samsung Galaxy A12. Yes, guys. This part is kind 
if surprising, but we can't do anything about it.
It is what it is. And that notch has 
a 8MP front camera. Aside from that, you might notice that its side bezels are a bit thick, especially its chin on the bottom. Of course on the bottom
because it's the "chin", it can't be on the top, right? (laughs) I've just realized what I said. (giggles) (entertainment music) Anyway, since we're already
on the front camera, we'll just talk about the camera. Actually, it has a lot of cameras,
four cameras. And to be exact, it has
a 48MP main camera with f/2.0 aperture,
5MP f/2.2 aperture ultra-wide angle lens, a 2MP macro lens,
and a 2MP depth sensor that also has a f/2.4 aperture. As expected guys for a budget device, the set of cameras 
that we have is okay. I'm not complaining,
because this is always what we get— four cameras where 
there is a depth sensor and macro lens, especially it's a Samsung device. For the front camera,
as usual for a Samsung device, you'll have the option
to use the wide and ultra-wide angle lens
even if it only has a single front camera. And guys, both the rear
and the front camera can be used to shoot 1080p
at 30 FPS. In fairness for the sample video
that we have guys and even for the sample photos
taken by the 8MP front camera, it didn't disappointed me
even if it's only 8MP. It's still clear 
and you can clearly see the clarity and quality
of the photos and videos taken by the Samsung Galaxy A12. And it is surprisingly good
for a budget device. In here, it's very clear and the subject-to-background 
separation is good. So let's now try to turn off
the lights. Here's another sample video
where we turned off the two soft box light. And to be honest, it's still okay. Actually, I'm expecting something of a noisy quality video,
but in fairness it's still okay. About the rear camera guys, the photos taken by the 48MP 
main camera are actually okay. And to be honest, 
I was also surprised, because a consistent quality
was given by the wide and ultra-wide angle lens. But, I kind of didn't like the subject-to-background separation when we're using its depth sensor or the live focus option. It's not as good
as I thought it is going to be. I'm just not that satisfied
with the colors and it's a bit undersaturated. Anyway, let's now talk
about the performance. (entertainment music) To be honest, 
since I bought the 6GB of RAM, I actually had no problems
with it in terms of multitasking, 
switching between applications. It's fast enough
for the price that I paid for it. I'm just not that sure
if it will still be the same if you'll buy its lower variant
which is the 4GB of RAM, which costs Php7,990. It has the MediaTek Helio P35 with a 12nm chipset. It also has an octa-core CPU. Of course I run the AnTuTu
on it guys before I download the applications and games the other day. Its result was actually a bit low. It's 109,293. And I'll say it again,
for the price that I paid for it, for Php10,000, it's really low. And if you'll remember the previous budget device
of Samsung which is the Samsung Galaxy A10s, it has the MediaTek Helio P22. It definitely did improved, because of course from P22 to P35. On paper, the changes are really big. That's me comparing Samsung device to another Samsung device. But again, if we'll compare 
this phone to other budget phones
that was released last quarter of 2020, Samsung Galaxy A12 
is kind of behind in terms of gaming
with the smartphones that I was mentioning. Gaming is okay guys. It's okay. You can really play Wild Rift
on this one. We didn't experience
any lags on this one while playing Wild Rift.
It is playable. But other games like
Call of Duty and Asphalt 9, there's a bit of some noticeable lag, and it may kind of hinder
your gameplay. And the gaming experience
that I had was not that smooth. So definitely, 
this Samsung Galaxy A12 is more on for people
that are casual gamers only or the ones who don't play
high graphics games. What I like about
the Samsung Galaxy A12, before we talk about its battery, is its option,
because you have, again, an option of 4GB RAM 
that has 128GB of storage or 6GB of RAM with 128GB
of internal storage. If you're going to buy
its lower variant that is Php7,990, to be honest, 
that's actually worth it, because we will already have
128GB of internal storage. Most of the budget phones before, if you'll remember,
the prices of 128GB are already Php8,000 to Php10,000. And that's not bad. And for that, 
if you don't have a budget and you only want to buy
its Php7,990 lower variant, for me it's okay and reasonable. For the software,
it has the One UI 2.5 based on Android 10. It's still not Android 11 yet and it doesn't have
the latest One UI 3.0, but this is already expected guys, from a Samsung budget device. It has a Dolby Atmos feature,
but we can only use this when we use a wired
or wireless earphones. It also has a dark mode
and focus mode, and then its power button
is also located here on the notification toggle. Actually, all Samsung
is already like this one. It also has bloatwares,
but it's not that many unlike with other smartphones. It already has 
an installed Lazada app and YouTube Music. But don't worry, 
it already has some preinstalled Google apps 
and YouTube application. Actually, to be honest,
a good suggestion for the students
are the Samsung budget devices because it already has
some preinstalled Microsoft applications
where we can use for school. (entertainment music) Now, for the battery. Maybe the reason why
it's kind of thick and heavy is because we got a big one, but not as big 
as the Samsung Galaxy M51. It has a 5,000mAh 
of battery capacity and it also has a 15W fast charging
power brick. Actually, the moment I unboxed it, of course I fully charged it first before I used it in real world. And until now, I think
it's my third day of using this Samsung Galaxy A12. It's not totally like this is 
the only one I'm using, because of course I have
other phones that I'm using. But, during those three days,
I've already made a gaming review on it, camera test, we've made a b-roll, 
a little bit of social media. I'm still left with around 35%
of battery life. And just imagine it guys, 5,000mAh, it really is a powerful amount of battery
for a budget device. It's probably because
it's only 720p resolution on this smartphone. To be honest, I still
haven't test the charging yet. But guys, the 15W is slow
for a smartphone that has a 5,000mAh
of battery capacity. We're not guessing guys,
but most of the smartphones that has 5,000mAh
of battery capacity that I've reviewed
in the past few months, most probably it'll take
two hours or more before you'll charge it to 100%. But again, I don't see it
as a problem for as long as the battery capacity is big. Again, it's okay to have
a big battery capacity than having a small battery capacity
with fast charging. Because most of the time, we're only charging
at the end of the day before we sleep, so when we wake up, it'll not matter anymore
if your device charged fast or not, because most probably
it's already fully charged when you wake up. This is only my opinion
when it comes to budget and midrange devices. But for flagship of course,
it's another thing. Anyway, that is it 
for our Samsung Galaxy A12 unboxing and quick review. Again, if you're going
to buy the Php7,990, for me it's still worth it,
because it'll still be able to get the
128GB of internal storage. The only problem is that
you won't get the same performance in terms
of multitasking that I've experienced on this one, because it'll be a different feeling for a smartphone with 4GB of RAM compared to the 6GB of RAM. The only cons that I see here
probably guys is its display. Because display is one
of the most important aspect of a smartphone. Yup. That is it 
for today's video guys. It's now getting loud
because there's a construction going on in front of our studio. If you're hearing anything,
I'm sorry. Again, it's your Tech Girl, Mary,
and see you on my next video. Bye!

saying that i wasn't [Music] when let me just do it [Music] know [Music] so now i gotta say goodbye [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] [Music] gotta stay away from what's going on guys my name is wade with tech daily so i've had my samsung galaxy a72 for quite a while now close to two months actually and normally i wouldn't wait that long for an initial review like this but i wanted to hold out a little longer in order to give this phone a fair shot this is a device that's obviously the successor to one of if not the most popular and in my opinion most important devices of 2020 the a71 a phone that i think set the stage for mid-range devices last year put the a series on the map for samsung particularly here in the us and because of all that this a72 was a highly anticipated successor and potential upgrade that i know a lot of people might have been interested in unfortunately while the a72 is a solid device i don't necessarily think this is the upgrade we were expecting or hoping for and furthermore considering some of the other devices that are available now even from samsung i don't know that the a72 is as appealing this year as the a71 was last year still even with those caveats the a72 is a great upper mid-range device it does have some improvements and new features versus last year it's still priced really well it's a great bang for your buck device i just think it's not quite as good as it could be and i'll get into all that in this video there's obviously a lot to talk about here so i won't waste any more time let's just go ahead and get into it and i'll let you guys know all my thoughts and opinions on the samsung galaxy a72 so first off let's talk about pricing and availability and where this phone sits in the samsung lineup now when it first launched the a72 was about a 450 device which isn't too bad prices have already come down a little bit though and you can actually snag one now for closer to 420 bucks on places like amazon price wise i think this phone is a solid deal and falls comfortably in that upper mid-range space in samsung's lineup the a72 is technically currently the highest end a series phone at least by model number however at least right now there's just the one model of the a72 this here regular one there's no a72 5g like how there was an a71 5g and that presents this weird issue there's a regular a52 and objectively this a72 is better than that phone it makes sense so far but there's also an a52 5g and side by side if you've seen my comparison video spec wise and feature-wise the a525g is better in a lot of ways than the a72 beyond just that 5g support and because of that i guess technically the a72 is not actually the highest and a series phone if you're looking at specs and features the a52 5g is so already not only is the overall a series lineup a bit confusing at the moment but you can kind of see why i don't necessarily think this a72 is the go-to top-tier a-series device this year of course there's a bit more to consider price point carrier compatibility availability in your region it's not an easy black and white sort of issue it's just something to think about with this phone and it's why i don't necessarily think the a72 is the default top tier a series option like the a71 was last year if you want to do some comparison shopping of your own though i'll leave some links down below to all the deals and discounts for this phone along with some other a series phones as well physically the a72 falls in line with not only all the other a series devices this year but also most of the top tier samsung flagship phones as well now which isn't a positive or a negative i guess just more point of consistency within samsung's phones we obviously got a slightly refreshed design this year versus the a71 there's no more glastic shiny rainbow finish it's just a simple matte plastic rear that matches even the s21 and note 20. it's simple it's durable if also a little boring maybe though i think this bright blue or more appropriately awesome blue as samsung calls it is a nice color for this device it's also held up really well unlike a glossy plastic this matte look keeps the scratches away and i haven't bothered to use a case on this phone at all the sides and frame are a shiny polished metal which i think balances out the look and feel it's a good weight in the hand it almost seems premium and the boxy flat profile this year with no more curved edges or display i think makes this phone feel more comfortable in the hand and a little easier to grip as well also one worthwhile addition to the build quality is an ip rating this phone is water and dust resistant a first for the a series and all in all i think the build and materials here collectively are pretty solid there's also nothing missing with the physical features either we get a headphone jack still on this device there's expandable storage there's even dual stereo speakers for the first time as well which deliver a fantastic out loud listening experience this is something i personally value quite highly so i was super happy to finally have it on this phone and i think while certain flagship phones seem to either take things away or go back and forth each year on what's added to the phones the a72 has all the basics all the extras really almost everything you need in a smartphone almost though there's still no wireless charging which i don't consider to be a huge deal really the more important point is just the fact that you still get a usbc charger and cable in the box unlike some thousand dollar flagships so that's nice to see at least but all in all this is still a really well-rounded smartphone underneath the display you do get a fingerprint reader and you can pair that up with face unlock as well for secondary biometric unlocking option now while i think the overall unlocking speeds are an improvement over last year they still don't quite match up to the likes of the s21 obviously or even the s20 fe so that's a little bit of a bummer i notice some inconsistencies every once in a while there's a hold up from time to time i'll have to adjust my grip but like i said overall the biometrics with both fingerprint and face unlock are an improvement they work pretty well one way or another you'll be able to get into your phone just fine i think there was just still a little more room for improvement now with the display itself overall i think this phone offers a stellar viewing experience and this is something samsung's a series devices have been known for now and this time around we do get even a little more with a new 90 hertz high refresh rate option this allows for a fast fluid and silky smooth experience with every tap touch and swipe and i think for a device in this price range this feature is a must have this year it's personally something i can't live without anymore and even something i think most average everyday smartphone users would notice if given the chance to see a side-by-side comparison with a 60 hertz device the only downside is that once again in the overall lineup the a52 5g offers a better 120hz display so as nice as it is that this 90hz feature was added to the a72 it's just not quite the absolute definitive upgrade to be fair though the difference between 90hz and hertz i think is tougher to see and everything else with the display itself is still really great it's a super amoled panel 2400 by 1080 resolution it's bright 800 nits of max brightness now it's bold it's colorful most importantly it's an upgrade over last year and at 6.7 inches you've got a lot of real estate to work with and viewing all your content it's a fantastic viewing experience it's just that there's technically some smartphones out there which are similarly priced that do offer a little more performance wise this i think is an area where the phone shines even if the specs on paper maybe don't inside this phone is powered by the snapdragon 720g chipset either six or eight gigs of ram 128 or 256 gigs of storage certainly an upper mid-range spec and yeah we can get nitpicky about the slight differences in snapdragon 700 series chipsets there's like three or four main different snapdragon chip sets out there that are so similar but generally speaking this one is plenty powerful for most everything you want it to do in fact there's nothing this phone can't do at least from my own experience in using it and having this device over the last couple of months has afforded me a fast and responsive android 11 experience with virtually no issues i also really like samsung's one ui 3.1 for just your general day-to-day interactions i think it's fluid i think it's fast and i think it's a nice upgrade i think this phone is also enough of a powerhouse to play any and all games you want to play flawlessly and this i think is where it makes way more sense to just save a ton of money while sacrificing very little on the performance side of things and going with the a72 instead of paying like twice as much or three times as much for an s series phone and gaining only a marginal and probably not so noticeable difference in performance now yes i think if you really want to get picky the a72 probably deserved a little more with the processor but is it something we would have noticed in day-to-day use no i don't really think so i've gone back and forth on this but in the end i do think this phone is specked just about right for what it is and what it does and even i think for its price point the processor isn't the only thing you're paying for after all you have to look at the phone as a whole when you compare the price points and as a whole beyond just the processor but also even looking at the internal specs and the overall performance i think is still well worth the money also the 5 000 milliamp battery inside this phone is plenty to get through more than a day's use under normal circumstances i think for most people this size battery is more than enough for me personally i was getting 12 to 14 hours of screen on time and i used my phone quite a bit what's sort of interesting is that this phone is a little thicker than last year i do think part of the reason is because of the slightly bigger battery and this is a phone that i think can absolutely go the distance each and every day no matter what it is you want to do with it finally let's talk about all those cameras around back and with this i think just like last year the a72 once again has a lot to offer and really shows how much effort samsung has put into its cameras on its mid-tier devices in years past the a series cameras were kind of a weak point but with the a71 and especially with this a72 now the results with the pictures and videos really are quite good hardware wise we get a 64 megapixel f 1.8 aperture main shooter a very useful eight megapixel telephoto lens for up to three times optical zoom and 30 times digital zoom the ever important 12 megapixel ultra wide lens and a 5 megapixel macro lens thrown on there for good measure the selfie camera is also a respectable 32 megapixel lens but all the specs aside i think the results speak for themselves this is a phone that overall offers a lot in the way of shooting modes features capabilities it's maybe not quite the modern day flagship caliper but it's like 2018 or 2019 flagship caliber there's a lot to offer here and even more to like i think this time around samsung made some changes that previous a series users might notice the ultra wide shots are better for example they're more consistent they're not so dark the telephoto lens is super useful with its zoom capabilities and a much better add-on than the macro lens which i never use but that's still there too i think samsung improved on skin tones as well there's still a lot of smoothing but selfies look better portrait shots have improved as well with the background and foreground separation all in all this is a phone i've not only enjoyed shooting with but often sometimes prefer over similar 400 to 500 smartphones again samsung has put a noticeable amount of effort into their camera capabilities anyway on these a series phones we saw it with the a71 last year and they've continued it even further with the a72 this year and all in all this is a very capable camera setup on this phone so if you couldn't tell i've generally been very happy with the a72 these past couple of months it's a great phone and there's a lot to like i think objectively it's an improvement over the a71 in a lot of ways there's added water resistance dual speakers a fresh design 90hz display of course better cameras all noticeable and worthwhile upgrades and as a standalone device i have no problem recommending it at its current price point the only issue really is just that not only did samsung kind of shoot themselves in the foot a little bit by releasing an a52 5g and not releasing an a72 5g at least not yet there's also just so many other samsung phones out right now and likely still upcoming for this year that i think the a72 now will kind of get lost in the shuffle or maybe squeezed out of the lineup if you're considering a new phone and you have four to five hundred dollars to spend you have a ton of options which is great for you but maybe not great news for the a72 simply because i'm not sure it's the outright best choice like the a71 was for a good chunk of the year last year overall it's still a great device though a fantastic option if you have it enjoy it i certainly have and if you're considering it don't let me influence you too much but if you have the option maybe still look into the a52 5g instead at least if it's available for you so there you go those are my thoughts on the a72 right now what do you guys think about this phone do you have one if you do i'd love to know your experience with it so far in the comments down below but hopefully you guys did enjoy this video be sure to follow tech daily on twitter and subscribe to the tech daily youtube channel if you haven't already and i'll see you guys later [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] me [Music] okay bye ciao you Well today is that we want to come out of the box in 2021 the first mobile phone out of the box super looking forward to finally have a feeling that we want to go home today to come out of the box is this S21 Ultra 5G then you can see it this time Packed with before a bit different and there are several key number is afraid to jump right over the entire last jump S20 S21 it is tragic that the 2021 does not skip a little should be more stable now that 21 years with just 2021 also with the feeling this is also full of good boxed thinning did not necessarily see a lot of small things ah ah really thank you thank you good cook then we come right out of the box this damping wow this out of the box Apple did not feel well done little pity that this time I pick up a little place in the Hall of Samsung's wisdom (I do not believe Samsung Mall logistics) so there I actually have to look at the phone's tear film that had the appearance of a we will first look at what this accessory is really very bad so thin a box no more so yeah this accessory to a Type-C Type-C of the transmission line and a manual then there's the most important thing there is this fact, so did not see the PIN needle in the boxed stuff is very simple manual transmission lines and mobile phone PIN needle body wow charging head no friends and no protective sleeve protective sleeve is a pity it did not really matter all that anyway, unplug all plucked light so I have a way to find more vendors (welcome cooperation) for everyone to do the lottery Well
then we quickly enter it today part of tear film film very much believe should tear film Stalker good tear film is very interesting to hear the whole feeling of wow looks pretty good silver color really feels good in fact, I hesitate super long that finally chose silver because I saw Zhongwen Ze movie that he took silver really this is too difficult show a mirror shipment for transport gradually after the last of the blue and then coupled with the feeling of silver out well and then not too stressed I think in addition to that I have just tear up the front layer of film than the super favorite in fact, a careful look at it this is a layer on top of a simple film that I asked the staff of the Samsung Pavilion wisdom they mean this in fact is not a fact, it is a scratch protector, but S10 and S20 Ultra are so used   so I might it will still stick with for a while when protection because it feels very good to use ultrasonic fingerprint good then followed by the appearance of this very controversial I personally feel that although we are the flagship of the black that I am also very fond of black but the phone because I got two black phones coupled with the Zhongwen Ze film really took great I immediately got a silver started feeling it a whole will think it is acceptable that start just out of view of when I see it will feel this feeling is the feeling surface that extends out because it would be very strange but great the entire lens module Will feel good in this camera module or super You see 87 football fields throughout the full extent of the convex lens or raised is that you can clearly feel that here is a piece of uplift and it seams this lens position in fact, did not say where in fact the middle one piece is a little seam it is not completely sealed, but it's a pity   I now see the entire terms have been watching full habit may also be because I do see a lot of movies out of the box with it or will have this seesaw effect because it really is too convex a lot, but I think in this case the lens module design is actually looking for a long time will feel full of futuristic and together with it the color name like this time it was called the Phantom silver Phantom black Phantom black Phantom with silver (black Star charm with star charm silver) is that it is a feeling that there is a Phantom of the Opera will use up much like the Phantom of the Opera Phantom of the kind of fact, I feel that this think it should be more or less echoed the feeling of color is named Phantom of the Opera mask that looks like the thought of watching Phantom of the Opera in London really miss ah then this is the S21's design that I'm here to take you to the S20's design you look like you'll actually which I personally think is good but the bare metal of the S20 camera here because it is such a cut in the past do not seem to know Jesus will feel this feeling that the future will be even more than that, then talk to the iPhone these which one of you would prefer a full I personally like the iPhone then this latter material with the silver Logo Logo it is also the sense that the silver, but this comparison it is almost impossible to stick fingerprints iPhone that I think it is a sticky fingerprints very nice design but this shot just a matter of opinion but because it is the kind of feeling I think it is double the iPhone will be a little boutique feel like a little silver but I think this looks pretty good, but I think it's silver how about texture less like because it will still stick fingerprints you look at it this fingerprint oil still attached to the top so that you still have to take care of it with a long time that the comparison is not entirely like the iPhone it does not need to take care of this material really full of good hope after Samsung can spend then I personally still like their black if you really are not sure what color you want, then you can still go to a physical store to look at my time watching videos directly the next set it so that it does not matter anyway, before I was two phones are black that we are speaking about this phone is the size of the wow this phone feels good to hold and then long size of this phone is 165.1 multiplied by 75.6 multiplied by its thickness of 8.9 mm of a very large phone, but it's wider than the width of the iPhone in terms of you can clearly feel the iPhone or slightly wider then the one thing you do not underestimate the iPhone wide What little is to make it that little bit my thumb can not touch the relationships here and along with its iOS design is not to say poorly designed (in fact, iOS design is not good = =) is that it is not for the big did you know that using a mobile phone to inform it that the left and right columns did not feel then I can only rely on tap to handle a pity but I think you see that this is still basically the width of the hook although you get back has been a bit distorted but the iPhone that is completely impossible that every iPhone hook here then it's time again from left back I feel very idiot miss One Hand Operation + ah then the whole very good grip that although it was a very heavy phone weight 229 grams this phone it but I have not had the me I used to weight training under the iPhone   accustomed to under S20 Ultra training so the width of my hand very badly, I do not have time to keep up with Like too should learn domineering hand this phone can grasp a hand to get to know something in the bag and then went good we look at it this camera's specifications and then part of this camera because it is too much, then I was basically directly it listed then you look at the specifications directly on the top part of the screen that I would say the focus of this examination examination of the students there do not sleep wake up quickly make a note of this focus is that it is part of phase I of the main lens focus after really do not understand it, but this time there is coupled with a laser autofocus sensor so I focus on it is still full of confidence in it about 8020 but you know the S20 Ultra pain this kind of thing really is very afraid ah afraid that I personally feel it this 3 times telephoto lens with 10x telephoto lens configuration in this direction is right because some people do not need to 10 times, but three times is full of often use to a range that I personally, if I actually used more often to two times it so 3 times ... I would want it to be two times because I think (iPhone) is 2.5 times a little too far and then the rest of the word is that it is also equipped with a flash so basically also full of good that is a pity, then I think it would make me miss the point S10 before it is time to reverse this charge also support it here, there will be a indicator that this indicator from S20 to pull after I feel a little pity it out because it's a good indicator full easy to use and then look at the front portion of the front of the camera lens is 40 million pixels pixels Fengyun front of the camera that I really miss is actually full because I personally feel the iPhone is shot in front of the camera whether night or in the sense that the sharpness of the Samsung did not do so good so I also miss the full Fengyun front of the camera and then we look it up, down, left and right very first left completely clean nothing then the right words Volume keys arranged a power key and then a portion of the top of wow two microphones are arranged holes and then the bottom portion is configured with a focus ah horn bore hole Type-C and a microphone hole and a SIM card slot that you look at this SIM card slot with this situation so close to the microphone hole is really a full easily plugged into the wrong (inserted in the wrong hole) I own myself in it with the top plug when there is a miss, but it's good insurance microphone is then we have not broken then look at it in the form of SIM card is how to come up with important PIN pin one of the few accessories to go this time or dual-slot entity so it will not go eSIM but did not feel too little What is less a memory card the memory card is pulled out Samsung finally do not give you a card I feel a little sad that the first open S series phone is no memory card, this will be a bit awkward because this phone is can not beat that 8K memory card for storage space if you really want to take seriously, then it is bound to get the maximum ... anyway, as good as the boot Hello SAMSUNG Galaxy wow finally home children go home saying that this picture is very 8K this conflict yeah your cooperation in Samsung's screen is absolutely not interesting to see Apple with Samsung ah interesting and welcome it then this phone has support facial recognition and fingerprints and then it has the fingerprints full of powerful it is this fingerprint the second generation of 3D Sonic Sensor is ultrasonic fingerprint than the first generation in terms of greater then 77% of the area of Qualcomm's (not the times ...) faster 50% (not times ...) it's about this I am not sure I may have found will know after that we have to set up the fingerprint fact, with its fingerprint location is good before I remember one generation (position) is a full generation low but I feel OK is a full position on a very comfortable well done that we first tested to see if it sounds familiar wow long time no hear a bit noisy press the mute that we first tested its fingerprint to unlock the speed of 123 wow really okay yeah   123 123 I feel full fast bad that if I put a little crooked, then 123 can still unlock it so it got pretty good at this we all need to wear masks era finally do not have to pull out the password has been playing over there really super retarded you direct this press go very fast very fast this time, then it is this screen is taking a little bit curved surface is not the very song that you look at the surface feel about the extent of something like this, but it would still have nasty curved screen people usually hated the white reflective of this it will be a little but I still do not think so serious to the entire grip feel pretty nice you will not want to inadvertently have the feeling like before because my Samsung phone to someone to help us take pictures when it has been very crazy idiot but inadvertently The extent of it I think its whole surface and the feeling I think it is just the right be full of good to see you probably will not be the curvature of the song but your screen looks and narrow is the border than on some of these you know the look of the border are not the same feeling its borders because of the surface of the screen and then a little more narrow and it is this right angles to the design although take up the matter but it feels really cool screen border a generation that is on screen to knock and then you look like the screen with holes dug difference bangs on the screen in this whole feeling is very different ah Apple really good again and then work harder this generation has a very important it is its screen update screen for the first time to a screen called LTPO screen then it is terrible to say that it is dynamic and it can update frequency from 10Hz is, you might see some photos pictures do not move when it is used 10Hz to increase its life and then you look at some of the more like playing video album ah, when it can be very strong 120Hz then it is to have this dynamic display have not seen the best of the update frequency is automatically adjusted to 120Hz let you in sliding feeling very smooth feeling is that I have not experienced this feeling and this pull-down notification bar is really too impressive single-handed pull the notification bar is moved not used the iPhone people do not understand very needs to be cherished and the screen is very powerful it after you see this screen fluency is the best resolution of 120Hz to us from the time we press this WQHD + FHD + to apply press down there to see it has not changed this dynamic fluency less ah so it can finally be open at the same time 2K plus 120Hz and then someone would say why should such a small phone was great I can do 2K 2K 2K why not so cool yeah this is good or not really feel the difference, but this kind of thing like a sports car as you have for your daily commute will be much faster it is cool but not too fast that we first concerned about this phone's specifications just because I suddenly found that I feel like I have not talked about that this phone it uses a Qualcomm Snapdragon S888 wow very domineering a name that now everyone is commonly known that it is a small dragon because it seems the heat might be a little problem so we would be more worried about this one but since that time I experience the experience of time will look at it the heat is not there a problem then a combination of storage space and memory part of the memory and storage space, then if there is storage space 256GB of memory plus a 12GB with 512GB of storage space plus 16GB of memory Taiwan is the bar I can not stick it burst straight up the 128G 256G and I know this year I'll be back to my iPhone in September will be changed (film investment in the iPhone out of the box) this phone will accompany me six months I did 256G Use or not And finished ah forget and no memory card 256 and 256 on the size of the battery is 5000mAh, then that charge is supported by 15W of fast charging with wireless wired wired fast charge fast charge 25W to 25W is a bit awkward because I was on this S20 Ultra that 25W to 45W on ... how about a little feeling back then although the speed measured S20 Ultra 45W and 25W with no difference but do not know too much to pity and support 5G then there are the new Wi-Fi 6E 6E but it seems this seems to have on your home network equipment to keep up with the job and then has IP68 waterproof and dustproof 3 one UI operating system is very good and this time it is a way to use with the S Pen wow cool that we usually take Note's S Pen to use, but because our channel is quite special I take my side amphibious biological Apple Pencil to Cece it possible to use the results look good test point is not no way to use or buy it so that the S Pen I Pre-election when there is pre-order in the matter but it has not arrived yet it may have to wait it sent to experience the film does not know if it will catch up with catch up, then I will speak on the inside and then I used this experience and has a hard body update on possible some people will be very concerned about is that it does not have a magnetic stripe MST sense of it so you can not brush when Samsung Pay to scare the clerk's no way shocked him three little I know is that Apple Pay " three cool Pooh, "he said, Why can brush magnetic stripe card anyway, so you are not yet now there is no way to scare him a good OK and then finished a phone's specifications we look at the performance of the screen and then the screen it is very Cock I heard someone speak its YouTube which can point to the HDR video 1440P 60FPS of wow this is to be more clearly ah Oh my god whole will feel like wow very bright screen of a Samsung home really is the best of the screen left to their own piece of the screen if it is supported by the Dynamic AMOLED 2X 6.8-inch screen that is used before and after the glass Corning gorilla glass that seventh generation Victus is LTPO screen with automatic adjustment so you endurance of 10Hz to 120Hz performance will be better that the maximum brightness of the screen is very fierce basically came 1500nits it topped its screen really do not need to say at the press conference announcing but we can take a closer look at it is it in this piece of screen ah part of the border chin or forehead is slightly longer than a bit rough so it is not the four sides of equal width design, but I think you should not be so concerned about it because you look like a screen door that you take a shine to travel through time people are open party picture is very real and very very full color Samsung is really good ah then this is a little bit they have to choke it in terms of a presentation called Eye Comfort "Shield" wow is Shield (everyone has to take the shield) Shield competent Mani This is to let you see guinea pig truck when the eyes are less likely to be directly affected by blue apple plus a school you have Shield Shield Shield I also have a really super love to learn, I really can not stand unplug the charging head even if this name should learn then you have to learn to see the guinea pig truck when you look at this particular color cute guinea pigs special healing and this is the part of the screen is then used to measure the focus of part of it wow before the S20 Ultra-focus close-up people coma very despair that this time we have requested the keyboard directly to the Xia debut keyboard and then we just put this up on the camera so that it is aligned to very good in fact very close to Jesus that Jesus did not feel coma and it really is yeah you look for to close my hands wow this will make you see me palmistry really close and will not have the feeling coma but I have reflected light is very close so basically completely solve the problem of coma you no longer have to worry about your co-workers to help run errands when buying lunch not help him beat a menu looks very clear (so later gave you run errands!) you did not see parts of the boundary blur (green curry and finally able to understand red curry) this is normal to have photographed the last time that you experience ah Note20 and S20 really is a question mark question mark coma so good part now appears to be solved very simply stick is long overdue to use ultra-wide angle to solve the millet have been tested, but after a good shot I might also bring a lot of food like apples father speak of (his channel is very interesting, we quickly subscribe wave) I really like to shoot a close-up cuisine then it appeared here in focus when it will have a little help focus you just do not know if I have seen little helper focus this name is really super idiot (I prefer to call focusing helper) Okay, then let's measure the feeling of focusing speed is basically basically stable full of ah caught it basically has caught its entire switching process like this you look at it in the handover process is very fast and then catch the word feeling very so good in terms of the camera should be no problem to capture that part of the movie, then the movie would be more focus speed there is a gradual but I think this video is better in terms of people because it does not have a momentary cut in the past it is a little sense of the paragraph is also full of progressive feel good too !!! so to focus speed in the presence of the laser autofocus module is even phase focusing ah still possible and then look at its camera interface part wow you look very much the model's look at it this professional model professional model has a lot of progress that you see it Even the ultra-wide-angle setting can support your professional mode wow direct you to see this part of the scene to take pictures of it then there is a great place this is (this animated super handsome) AF with AE you see it for the exposure and focus point can be set separately do I think this is very good and in the case of a professional model is very fierce is its longest exposure time to 30 seconds so you can basically set to the exposure you want and then you can also vote for you is to ultra wide-angle lens or general I feel very good very good then followed by YouTuber like everyone liked the feature called best director director mode this mode it is much worse that it can be said that this direct four case shots are up front of the camera like ah then three shots back before switching lenses let you look at it you can preview how all the past that you feel like the kind of director that it is all in the past that it can be directly to the position you want and then it can make such a split-screen shot of many YouTuber beat Vlog is a very good choice of a good and practical part then I finished speaking, I think some of it is muscle, but not in the show how practical is this first first place have not seen 100 times 100 times zoom back again then I do this 100 times zoom to shoot ah shoot where less than what it should be with a 30 times 10 times 10 times wow wow the iPhone has become a good shot of this sharp ah 30 times that if something could not shoot straight to it in this 100 times zoom when it added the stabilization of this screen if you really take away from the it can be used when the AI way to lock the screen let you live in this part of judder will reduce the number of 100 times but this is what I think it really show muscle personally, I think it has less than 10 times basically doing very well 10 times the screen with the words worthy 100 times very good but can really wow this looks so fine ah oh wow so close to have to focus a little sick so yeah this is also full of good feeling but after more than 10 times on chance my personal experience I used the S20 Ultra is very small only what I want to watch the person photographed in the name of the company or that is what will be used when the person or I want to see my family far corner salty fried chicken shop has not opened at the time because you know that the snack bar to make some bosses simply burst three days of fishing two days of drying super-cool so that I will use only the time but this is what I've got you did not show what part of the muscle and then there is a place to show that this muscle 8K 24FPS wow this show is simply explode I think it feels very much like the big boss one day suddenly say Hey I want to tell you on the phone 8K record you help me get then you probably asked him, but Jesus did not phone screen only 2K to 8K he said whatever to do next I do not believe we can do it all work together to defeat the shed next door like this and then you ask him to say so, but it seems no use, he said I do not care I just want to feel like the boss I think that is the kind of record you want on your phone and then 8K your maximum storage space is only there to 512 and then you play when you need to have support corresponding device I think this is a little difficult to say it anyway, so it did then followed by some very interesting clips like when you take pictures also can save RAW files that the RAW files I do not know how it feels because I actually seldom before with RAW files is not clear to APP for Android RAW file in its native albums go inside edit or APP which has a relatively easy if you know the bottom can leave a message to tell me then there's a question I've always wanted to ask is this a record wow this is really key to shoot someone with it if someone with a message underneath the words tell me I'm really curious too I personally do not believe this thing because I think precious moments on that for a few seconds if it does not help you if you caught a little pity ah Well then finally is some other acrobatics like this phone supports S Pen that we can see that it is actually no place like the S Pen is inserted in the press conference announcing his pocket directly out of the S Pen that I am in the process of leading machine I have to go try their S Pen I think that using up feeling more like a pen (though still small) Note that the S pen, then I think a lot like a toothpick but this time the S pen to me now that a trial is not Bluetooth-enabled so it can not there are those Halibote gestures you can not call it over and over again that I take the weapon suddenly forget just have not talked about it behind the edge there will be (slightly) speaking part of the back cover of the issue raised in some people say he reacted look at this wow you really see this fingerprint is a little bit more oil should be ah my hand a little oil it will be a little swelling expansion in the income side of the edge of the place the feeling (really a little bit) I personally really look at the camera and the naked eye is that there is indeed a problem, but you are not so big I do not think it to be so serious because it feels there is a little swelling up a little but does not have to say to make you feel uncomfortable or say very much influence to use in this sense it is no angle to shoot do not know if that looks out very concerned about a friend, then you can go to the scene feel because in fact the silver and the black are really nice and you get on the field and see what you really like this is the most important Well wow finally home feels so good I can finally return to the embrace of Google keyboard and double-click to enter camera ah ultrasonic fingerprint and then there is this pull-down notification wow this is really cool too cool to not work after Jesus my next film will be a movie experience that week which contains the camera's blind that time I will test the iPhone 12 Pro Max S20 as well as Mi 10 Ultra that I will not come up corpse of friends (... or should it look like a whip) should be playing less to win so that we can also look forward to it in addition to the movie experience I have it will be a test of endurance so if you want to test what can leave a message to tell me that under no accident, then a film should also have a sponsor to provide lottery activities are very welcome to the major sponsor of both my cell phone charger shell hope is related to sponsor my cell phone out of the box this year, all activities so that I have a way out of the box to give you more phones to see that this is a day that started out of the box S21 Ultra fast video Well I think it was silver Bang Bang's nice if you have any questions or want to know what the bottom of a message can tell me if you like this video, then remember also helped me remember who likes to subscribe to my channel then we next movie goodbye Ciao Ciao Bye Bye [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Novus it's your chance I have managed this iPhone excess max and now you have to chance to win this beautiful phone look at that in beautiful gold and this fall you can win you guys are amazing these days and that's why I will give you something back and what you have to do is first step like this video then subscribe had a test and make sure that the notification clock is on next service like had a test on Instagram and on Facebook and the last point is write a corner of the words pick me and then guys were able to win this beautiful form and just good luck to everyone and now enjoy this video [Music] [Music] [Music] it's so sad one shot was enough killed his phone his phone doesn't start up anymore it's completely done you could do one shot here but let's continue with this experiment [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and this guy's was my questions with these Samsung Galaxy S 10 plus antigone guys thanks for watching - see my next crash test and thumbs up for new questions and [Music] samsung's next flagship tablet is already in development it's gonna be the successor to the Galaxy Tab as six so we can expect it to be called the Galaxy Tab s 7 I am Ken oh and the business and core tech be sure to subscribe and hit the bell ah-1 so you don't miss any future videos it's not certain if Samsung will call it the Galaxy Tab s 7 because they skipped 9 numbers to align the S series with the new decade so they might just do the same thing with the new tablet and call it the Galaxy Tab s xx anyways whatever it ends up in cord it's certain that Samsung is gonna release a flagship tablet this year they aren't much details about the Tab s 7 yet but we already know the model numbers thanks to the guys from Galaxy club there's gonna be two variants a Wi-Fi and a cellular with the model number SMT 970 and SMT 975 respectively and considering Samsung is going to use the snapdragon 865 we can expect 5g on board on the cellular variant we can also expect a similar ten point five inch wqxga Super AMOLED display with a few improvements here and there also I'm pretty sure Samsung is gonna use a 120 Hertz display as seen on the galaxy s 20 series as this will help it compete better against the new iPad pro and it will also provide a better user experience we can also expect the faster 25 watt fast charger as compared to the 15 watts that was coupled with the Galaxy Tab as six they might also trim down the bezels and go with the Pancho display although that's just a speculation but if they do go with the Pancho display then that means the bezels will be really small it should also have the same in display fingerprint sensor albeit an ultrasonic sensor will be a welcome improvement over the optical sensor on the Galaxy Tab s 6 also it wouldn't hurt to have a bigger battery considering they were able to fit a five thousand milliamp hours battery in the samsung galaxy s 20 aura they should be able to fit a bigger battery in the Galaxy Tab s 7 or s 20 we can expect it to be released sometime this summer just like the release the Galaxy Tab s 6 again these are all just speculations the only thing that has been confirmed are the model numbers so let me know what you think about the Galaxy Tab s 7 or 20 in the comment section below what would be a must-have feature that will make you buy one like if you enjoyed the video and be sure to subscribe and hit the bell icon so you don't miss any future videos thanks for watching guys see you in the next one hey guys soccer from sauki tech and in today's video we are gonna be talking about a brand new powerful smartphone that samsung is about to release that is gonna be replacing the samsung galaxy note 21 ultra for this year now as you know if you're not up to date the note 21 ultra has been canceled for this year a lot of people are not happy about this but samsung seems to have an incentive in place that we are going to be talking about but just to be clear samsung did have an annual shareholders meeting in which dj koh himself said that the note 21 ultra is cancelled so it's not coming it's gone at least for this year that's a known fact but it looks like we do have this incredible phone coming up that people could consider as a replacement let's talk about that right now but first a quick message from one of my favorite sponsors guys check out one of my favorite apps blinkist which also happens to be the sponsor of this video so in today's age we are all busy and it's hard to sit down and find some time to read popular books to satisfy our intellectual curiosity and our quest for knowledge now what if there was an app that could let you digest a book in 15 minutes or less well blinkers can they take thousands of non-fiction books and condense them into text or audio that you can get through within 15 minutes you get all the core ideas and the essential information from that book and basically level up your overall knowledge and intelligence blinkist has books on technology productivity philosophy the future relationships creativity politics and much more there are thousands of books at your disposal i just finished reading the age of cryptocurrency by michael casey because i was interested in learning more about bitcoin and now i am better informed and all it took was 13 minutes so here's the amazing deal that they have for you the first 100 people to go to blinkist.com saki tech are going to get unlimited access for one week to try it out and if you decide to keep your membership you'll get 25 off their usual pricing that's an incredible deal and all the links are gonna be down below all right so the phone i'm talking about is the samsung galaxy z fold three and of course i know what you're thinking right away this is a very expensive phone the samsung galaxy fold first one and the second one uh worth two thousand dollars now the good news comes in the form of a huge price cut on these incredible phones and some features that are going to be appearing on these phones that could make them an acceptable replacement for a samsung galaxy note 21 ultra now obviously with two thousand dollar price tag that's not going to happen but we do have an exclusive uh article from sam mobile.com they are saying samsung is thinking of a 20 price drop on the samsung galaxy fold 3. so if the phone is 2 000 that's 400 off so that phone in all its glory is gonna be one thousand six hundred dollars if you look back in history the samsung galaxy note 20 ultra almost was one thousand five hundred dollars so now they're going to be much more closer in price if this report from sam mobile is in fact uh correct it seems to be an exclusive report they do have a good track record now the other thing that we know for a fact is the samsung galaxy fault 3 is going to support the s pen a hundred percent so one of the signature features of the note 20 ultra is obviously s pen the the z fold three is going to support the s pen now i am assuming and hoping that the s-pen is going to ship with a slot in the phone so i want the s-pen to be in the phone i don't want it to be an option that you can buy separately uh like the s21 series because it is not the same experience you do have to buy a bigger case just to accommodate the s pen that's not the way i like it i like the note 20s because you can have the s pen in the body of the phone so hopefully the z-fold 3 is going to have a slot a housing in it for the s-pen and that would be incredible and it's highly likely that's going to happen and we are potentially going to see under display camera tech so the camera you're not going to have a punch hole cut out on the screen it's going to be hidden under the screen it may not be a hundred percent invisible but it's going to be a much more immersive experience so i don't have to tell you guys how amazing the samsung galaxy fold devices are now i do have a samsung galaxy full 2. it's an incredible device the problem was initially when i purchased it it was 2 000 i would never buy that as a consumer so if the samsung lc full three is in fact one thousand six hundred dollars it has the s pen it's got all this under display technology and of course the latest cameras i think it would be an acceptable replacement uh for the note 20 21 ultra for this year that doesn't mean i don't want the note series to come back i want them to come back but i think they have something good in store for us samsung is known to make these amazing deals uh to satisfy customers and of course when you actually pre-order the phone you are gonna get some great deals with that as well probably free earbuds uh 200 instant credit and all that stuff okay so just a quick heads up i know there's a lot of people out there disappointed with the lack of the note 21 ultra this year but this could be a great way to step into the foldable market and honestly get the best uh the samsung galaxy full devices are highly premium products so let me know what you think i mean uh would that be acceptable to you so they took away the note 21 ultra uh probably would have been very expensive anyway fifteen hundred dollars but now they are having this z full three according to this report may not be real but they do have this exclusive report on sam mobile they're saying it's going to be 1600 as a consumer would that be acceptable to you drop your comments down below let me know for now guys have a fantastic day all right Welcome everybody, thanks for joining us. I'm glad to be with you. Last year was extremely difficult for everyone, but we are optimistic at this moment. Just think how fast we developed vaccines. I think it is an amazing human triumph. So does Exynos team. It makes me think of a young bird, trying hard to break free and fly. That's the spirit of our team, and very proud of our achievements. So today, we are back with the brand new, game-changing technologies. And here it is The all-new Exynos 2100. Hello everyone. Thanks for being with us today. Exynos is already the heart and soul of billions of mobile devices around the world, and the Exynos 2100 makes it even better. It's our first flagship processor based on the 5nm EUV process. It uses an incredibly advanced fine node technology, for exceptional performance, and efficient power consumption. And critically, we moved to a 5nm process. Compared with 7nm processors, 5nm gives you up to a 10% increase in performance, and approximately 20% less power consumption. Let's take a closer look! The Exynos 2100 is built around eight powerful cores with a tri-cluster CPU architecture, including Arm's powerful Cortex-X1 core running at 2.9GHz, three high-performance Cortex-A78 cores, and four power-efficient A55 cores.
The powerful Cortex-X1 core is customized for Exynos through the Cortex-X Custom program in close collaboration with Arm. And for faster and more efficient operation, we enhanced many of the key elements inside the chip, offering better cache memory, a stronger scheduler, and more efficient voltage control. The result is more than 30% better performance than its predecessor.  The GPU is also an important part of this story today.  As consumers increasingly turn to their devices for videos, games and even AI, the industry is pushing ahead with more powerful graphics engines. So, the Exynos 2100 integrates Arm's advanced graphic engine - the Mali-G78. It has fourteen incredibly powerful graphics engines, offering more than 40% boost in performance. All GPU cores are optimized to enable a smoother, truly stunning and seamless graphics experience. And we want to make sure our users can enjoy that powerful graphics performance for as long as possible. So we developed a solution for reducing power consumption. We call it AMIGO short for Advanced Multi-IP Governor.  It helps your battery keep up during intense graphics operations like 3D gaming, or 4K and 8K videos. Bottom line, the Exynos 2100 is our most powerful processor to-date, built from the ground up to deliver the ultimate mobile computing experience to consumers. It strikes the perfect balance between three key pillars: A powerful CPU. A blazing fast GPU. And ultra-efficient power consumption. Now, let's take a look ahead at how it impacts AI and multi-media. And for that, here's my colleague Sukhwan Lim. Thanks, Joonseok. AI has endless power to transform our daily lives, and revolutionize our industry landscape. Samsung Exynos processors lead the way for on-device AI. We optimized speed and power efficiency, delivering the cutting-edge performance needed to maximize on-device AI processing power. When we first introduced the NPU on our Exynos processor in 2018, it operated at 1.9 Tera Operations per Second. Just one year later, we increased that to 15, dramatically boosting AI performance. And by upgrading the design and performance of NPUs and DSPs, Exynos 2100 can deliver AI speeds of up to 26 TOPS. It integrates three powerful NPU cores, and more than triples the number of frames per second. But we also know that more performance means more power consumption. So we made some careful architectural choices, including a feature-map compressor, to increase the power efficiency by a factor of two. This powerful and efficient AI engine delivers game changing performance for functions that users can benefit from every day. And the first one that comes to mind is the camera. Whenever a new smartphone comes out, consumers focus on the camera. So we built the Exynos 2100 with an enhanced NPU and ISP. The ISP integrates advanced algorithms and improves picture quality even further, elevating everyday photography to a pro-level experience. The advanced ISP also supports cameras up to 200 megapixels, and connects up to 6 individual image sensors for multi-camera setups. At the moment when you point and shoot, the ISP works to understand the scene. It also recognizes and classifies objects like faces, hair, sky, trees, and flowers. That helps the Exynos 2100 to optimize the color, white balance, sharpness, noise, exposure and even dynamic range. We also enhanced the video experience with our specialized multi-frame processing engine. And we added an advanced multi-format codec that supports 4K recording at 120 frames per second and 8K playback at 60 frames per second. We're also the first in the industry to incorporate the AV1 decoder for 8K resolution video. And with enhanced low power processing, you can enjoy 4K and 8K videos longer than ever before. Now one of the mobile technologies that make a big difference for all of these things is super-fast data speeds. And that means 5G. Let me turn the stage over to my colleague, Olivia Kim. she will tell you how we've prepared for the 5G era with the Exynos 2100. Thanks, Seokwhan. The 5G revolution is right in front of us, and it's going to be amazing. With hyper speed connectivity, it brings to life so many amazing services: from true autonomous driving, to billions of IoT sensors, VR, and so much more. At Samsung, we're addressing this by staying at the cutting edge. Each new Exynos generation incorporates truly advanced connectivity. We released the world's first commercial LTE modem in 2009 and, in 2018, we implemented OTA 5G NR data calls, and later introduced the company's first 5G modem chip with 6Gbps data speeds. 2021 will see the second phase of commercial 5G services beginning in more markets around the world, with increased availability of millimeter wave services. We'll also see a wider range of 5G devices, with broader feature sets, and we need to be ready with a wider selection of 5G chipsets. And that's where the Exynos 2100 comes in. It is Samsung's first top-tier 5G-integrated mobile processor built for premium smartphones. It integrates the AP and 5G into a single chip, saving space, cutting costs, and reducing power consumption. It also supports both sub-6GHz and the mmWave spectrum. The result is blazing fast downloads of up to 7.35Gbps in mmWave and up to 5.1Gbps in sub-6GHz. Now, before we close, I do want to say a few words about device security, because we know that our smartphones have become more vulnerable. Think about all those financial transactions we do. Our phones even hold our biometric info, and all that data should be tightly protected. So since the release of Android 9, hardware-backed security has become a requirement, with the need to offer a Strong Box Key master. In fact, we have integrated security into the hardware since Exynos 990, and the new Exynos 2100's embedded Secure Element makes it even stronger. So that's it for our product introduction. Before we say goodbye,  let's give the last word to Inyup Kang. First off, thanks to the Exynos team today. We unveiled our most advanced mobile processor yet. It's going to create premium mobile computing experiences. And we won't stop here. We are working together with AMD, and we'll have a next generation mobile GPU in the next flagship product. That's our mission, and with the support and inspiration from our users and fans, we will continue to leap frog. Today, it's my great pleasure to announce that Exynos is back! Please be safe. Thank you very much. let's just say that i hope that you like those google pixel design leaks because yes we have more of these on the google pixel 6 that kind of confirm at least some of the previous information we had then we have a new leak that gives us more details on the galaxy z-fold and z-flip's launch dates as well as display information and if you're waiting on a moto razr this year you might want to look for another clamshell thinking of samsung because anyways i'm jaime rivera and seriously google what took you guys so long i mean you guys have been really slacking with the leaks this year this is parking now daily the official news today begin with deals as you can expect and yes the same thing remains where you can skip these in the time codes anyways let's start with samsung products which are the gift that keeps on giving amazon has the galaxy s 21 plus for a 200 discount leaving the base model for 7.99 but then if you move on to samsung.com you can still get the s215g for a total of just 100 bucks that s 21 plus for just 200 and then the ultra for as low as 500 but you still need an eligible device for trading now if you're looking for a laptop the galaxy book pro 360 that i just reviewed is 500 bucks but again you need a laptop for trade-in they also have a deal of the day on one of their q led 4k smart tvs which is 700 off now back on to amazon the oneplus 8t has a major discount pretty much leaving it at 549 the oneplus 9 is also 50 off leaving the winter mist aka purple variant for 680 bucks we have more deals on other samsung products and hyzer headphones and more in the description and finally if you want to save both time and money we have a special promotion for nordpass premium where you can get a 70 discount for one of the best password managers in the market also stick around to our website as uh we're already covering some early prime deals which are about to get pretty hot let's keep on with the official news but move to oneplus as the company has been very active with their nord series over the past couple of weeks last week we got the nord ce which is exclusive to india europe and the middle east at the moment and today we get the brand new oneplus nord n200 5g now kicking off with the specifications you get a 6.49 inch full hd plus display running at 90 hertz it's powered by the qualcomm snapdragon 485 g along with 4 gigs of ram 64 gigs of expandable storage and you get a triple camera at the back with a 13 megapixel main sensor and the other two are kind of forgettable two megapixel depth sensor and also a two megapixel macro other specs include a five thousand milliamp hour battery with the 18 watt charging and finally it comes in a single blue quantum color variant and really what makes it special is that you get 5g capabilities 90hz display at 240 bucks yeah that's right it'll go on sale on june 25th and it'll be available in the united states and canada in retailers like amazon best buy along with carriers like t-mobile now let's shift gears onto motorola as it looks like it's not the best time to be a razer fan at all and i mean i was but then they never fulfilled my order with the first one and it just made the experience so bad that it just made me forget about it but i know it's not the case for some of you like michael fisher and he's the only guy i know but anyways last year the motor razer 5g was a very good upgrade over the first model and rumors were that we were getting a 2021 model well we have a new leak from ross young that mentions that there will be no razor foldable in 2021 not only that but he also mentions that razer fans will most likely have to wait until the second half of next year now ross did not provide reasons as to why moto will be skipping the device this year but a ton of companies are facing manufacturing issues because of the global ship shortage so that might be the case so far we don't have much information on what we can expect for that next model and it just really would not be a good idea to speculate but we're expecting a better hinge new cameras newer chip if they get one and hopefully a better display as well let's see if motorola mentions something on the matter as uh well i know that again michael will be very disappointed now speaking of foldables let's switch on to the ones you will get which come from samsung with the galaxy's evil 3 and the z-flip 3 but actually today we have two different reports let's start with another ross young leak where he claims that corning will share the z-flip 3's utg business with a company called shot or scott fine i get it why people complain about reading my name wrong but anyways he mentions that also a korean company will handle the thinning the cutting and other steps for the process with this being the first win for the utg business because it's gaining more partners now that we got that out of the way let's talk about what we can expect for these foldables last week we got a report from john prosser claiming that both devices will be released on august 27th and now we have a new report from a korean news outlet that claims that the unpacked event will take place either on the first or second week of august but then they also mentioned that august 27th date to be when these devices will go on sale something that we didn't mention last time was that we were also expecting a galaxy watch 4 and even galaxy buds 2 at this event so keep that in mind finally the report also mentions that the s21 fv is still happening that it'll just be launched until later probably september so yeah august 27 for the launch set your calendars for an early impact or pretty much the same time frame for the unpacked on early august and finally for the hottest news today let's talk pixels like finally google finally anyways a couple of weeks ago we got a storm surge of pixel leaks that included the design and some specifications and now we get some more of that to kind of complement the previous leaks let's start with a nine to five google report where some details in the code of android 12's beta show that google is working on a new wireless charger and uh well it's been three years since we got the pixel stand and that was better than apple's air power but according to the report the code mentions cooling fans in the charger meaning that it'll most likely be able to go over 10 watts which we got with the original pixel stand and it's kind of like what we get from samsung and oneplus now moving on from the charger we have some new case renders that were shared by ice universe showing a transparent case that pretty much confirms the design that we've been seeing for what the past month and here you can see the new camera hump that is reminiscent of the nexus 6p the openings for the speaker grilles at the bottom as well as an opening at the top for the microphone apparently these case renders are for the regular pixel but uh we're also expecting to get a pro variant this year so far when it comes to both units we hear 6.4 and 6.7 inch displays respectively a new custom 5 nanometer soc from google as well as improved camera hardware that includes a 50 megapixel main sensor apparently we can expect these at their regular october time frame so i mean yeah those leaked reviews are kind of already late but anyways for today's question let us know i mean what do you think about the google pixel 6 so far do you like the design and what you're hearing so far because honestly for me i just wanted to not be a mid-ranger that's really all i care about but that's just me leave us a comment down below we'd love to know your opinion friends again if you want to get the news earlier follow us on fucknow.com and subscribe to our channel for more videos like this one you also follow us on social medias our extended coverage happens on instagram and follow me on my personal handles to see me complain about the obvious from google please give this video a thumbs up if you liked what you saw i'm jaime rivera thanks so much for watching we'll see you tomorrow [Music] is the success of the Galaxy Note that led to the galaxy grand a cheaper alternative that has a large screen and dual SIM functionality our second-generation grand - is announced and will be available in stores very soon it is expected to be priced around 23,000 rupees and it has a lot more to offer now the galaxy grand - borrows more elements of design from the no.3 than the original galaxy grand which is not a bad inspiration it has the fall at the back with the stitching on the edges and besides have that metallic finish that's no different from any other galaxy phone the front is taken over by a 5.25 inch HD screen it's not full HD but much sharper than the original Grande which had a low resolution screen the phone weighs a hundred and sixty-three grams which is pretty much the same as the previous generation and it's also a little taller but it's narrower from the sides and even thinner the phone is powered by a quad-core processor clocked at 1.19 gigahertz it's a new Snapdragon s4 processor which is supposed to be more powerfully than previous generation it also comes with one-and-a-half GB of RAM and 8gb of internal storage which is very little but pop up in the back and you will find an expandable memory slot which can house a 64 GB microSD card so we can live with it you'll also notice the two SIM slots and a decent size 2600 milliamp hour battery the phone comes with the Android 4.3 and it has the usual Samsung's TouchWiz interface like the note 3 the grand 2 also supports multi-window so you can open two apps at the same time now in terms of performance the new grand is surely a bump up from the previous generation so it can deliver a smooth smartphone experience casual arcade style action is easy to handle but I'm not so sure it will do well with graphic intensive games now I'm not a big fan of benchmark tests but in the case of grand - I just did it just to give you an idea of where it stands in terms of sure processing power you can check out the detailed benchmark score in this other video by clicking on the link the camera is an 8 megapixel shooter and it takes decent shots but nothing extraordinary the video quality was relatively good if you'd like to check out the detail camera performance then click on the link and pop open in a new tab [Music] overall the grand two is a significant jump in terms of screen quality and performance it's a decent option if you're looking for a dual SIM phone if you're a casual smartphone gamer it will do for the cheaper price you could check out the Moto G which is another good option and that's gonna be available in dual SIM soon but if you're not so hung up about the dual SIM functionality then you could go for something like a Galaxy s3 which is also under 25,000 rupees or here's what I would do with a little bit more money get the Nexus 5 is the best value for money smartphone in the market as of now and the jump over the grand - in terms of performance and screen quality is huge plus you get a clean version of Android KitKat you can check out this video where I compare the Nexus 5 to the iPhone 5s yeah I know it's a $350 smartphone versus a $650 smartphone but that's the point that's how good the Nexus 5 is anyway we are deviating here what do you think of the grand - are you considering it as your next smartphone speak up in the comment section below and like share and subscribe thank you for watching you hey bridie aren't you jay's girlfriend now yeah that's actually why i'm texting you can you catfish him to see if he would cheat on me what's in it for me if he fails i'll date you instead no fine

spreading all around my room my world's so bright it's hard to breathe but that's all right [Music] shh [Music] bye [Music] [Music] you this one you told me about and we don't even have to get into the whole thing because you were all flustered this morning uh you were like you don't understand we can't talk about it on the show crazy things have happened and i was like really i feel like we could talk about the show we just have to be you know approach it in a responsible manner but that's not fun well you guys have no idea will he do off the air type of things he gets up to it's really out of control half the time what he calls fun yeah yeah it's terrifying stuff this guy calls fun it shows it to me i go oh god it's what you call fun samsung had i guess i don't know if it was a mistake or a mishap or just an unexpected outcome supposedly at some point last night they introduced this new virtual assistant called sam she's got the samsung shirt and it was a company that actually made this is a 3d character from what was the name of the the i guess is it a developer animator light farm studios light farm studios they put this together you scroll down you can see some other images and the internet just i guess freaked out they use software lightfarm also revealed the applications they used to create samsung's new virtual assistant sam they used adobe after effects slide fx houdini adobe photoshop marvelous designer and blender 3d they essentially created this cg character in taking a form of a virtual assistant and somehow someway the internet collectively lost its cool when they saw this uh render show up on social media and you said even the way in which it was posted was a little bit strange what do you mean like did it emerge from samsung's official account or did it come from elsewhere well i was looking at it and it was um trending number one on twitter for like around like two three hours and then it was gone um i couldn't find the original post but it was a lot of pictures of this girl yeah and it was the same pictures just like her posing right i couldn't find the original so so people took this and ran with it wherever it originated uh whether it was samsung's official account or if it was coming directly from uh the studio that created it and people probably then start to put uh create their own animations many of which uh not safe for work type animations yeah very loose but quickly like it was like you said within half an hour they started going nuts and and people just lost their mind and said oh my god she's too attractive sam from samsung we can't handle ourselves type of thing and i'm sitting there this morning and i'm confused well i'm confused you're showing me this and you're explaining the story to me and i'm like oh yeah i mean how what are they supposed to make her look like if you are set with this task you're gonna make this individual attractive i would assume sure but the whole thing vanished i guess the official traces of it i mean it will never vanish happen on the internet and ain't gonna vanish but many of the traces of the official traces of it are no longer there i mean the original uh source the website if i click on it from light farm yeah it's you don't see it maybe the site crashed or something why is the site grayed out like that it's very strange it's because it's it's a pop-up that's supposed to show maybe like a case study of how they made it but i can't find uh can't find it wow a little vanishing act and a back track and they maybe they saw what what the internet was prepared to do with it and they didn't want the association i don't know this is all speculative it was very mysterious the way it all went down but essentially like many things people get a hold of it and they uh what do they do they ruin it did they ruin it maybe they ruined it i don't know or maybe they maybe the individuals who are motivated to uh amplify the situation maybe they got exactly what they wanted i don't know this is not my area of expertise the virtual assistant but there's a lot of people talking about you see this guy look he ditched apple because of how attractive sam sam virtual assistant from samsung happened to be yeah come on will you help me out here man when i came to you with this story i was just like man i come to you with a story i present you it's uh it's such a weird uh anomaly because when i saw it last night it just felt like it was like a glitch in the matrix it's like how how was it getting like 90 000 tweets per hour or whatever and it was just like trending and then all of a sudden it was gone but while i was looking at it it was just like you think samsung called them up like they call it jack dorsey on twitter and they're like oh damn this thing got nasty uh get rid of this we can't have samsung looking like they promoted this behavior this thing with all this the type of posts that user gen stuff they were doing with this character so quickly maybe um yeah and i was talking to you about whatever the combination was of like your favorite tech brand or a high profile tech brand and then like an attractive virtual like there was some extra motivator for people they're like um i like tech and well she's attractive it's like what yeah because we never had like an avatar for like uh a tech brand it was just too much you can't throw all that at me at once yeah maybe i don't know because i looked at the character i'm like i don't know what this looks like all those things that i see on the internet all those like animated characters sort of look like that don't they sure yeah i'm 74 years old leave me alone yeah leave me alone here's a cool one though [Music] [Laughter] huh [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] bye [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Music] [Applause] do [Applause] [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] me [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] yo do you remember when samsung spent entire three minutes straight in the keynote just talking about the matte black color i get it [Music] hey what's up mkbhd here and this is a samsung galaxy s 21 ultra and it's an incredibly good phone i gotta say now the thing is not only does it do a lot on paper because we already know about the big numbers the huge specs the ultra story that's all still here but it does a lot of stuff that doesn't show up on the spec sheet a lot of subtle tweaks and changes that turn this from a really good phone to a great one so of course i gotta start with the finish because well i've been saying matte black everything for a solid couple of years now to the point where it's it's on a shirt my car probably my most precious possession is wrapped in matte black and its name is phantom so i guess you could say this phantom black galaxy s21 ultra the matte finish kind of speaks to me and like i said it's not going to be on the spec sheet but this is a really nice finish it's a really very clean flat smooth black finish on glass and then with a slightly different texture on the metal housing around the cameras and then it turns into your typical glossy black around the edges but just the whole look of this phone to me is very intentional i'm on record saying i actually really like it and that was my first impressions video and i'm sticking by that just the way the camera module curves into the body of the phone the way it looks like like an overlay of another s21 ultra on top of the first one really the worst thing about it is that it's still uneven so it still rocks on a table but everything else about this design i think is as good as it gets i was kind of worried it would look great out the box actually and then just collect a ton of fingerprints and look awful but this matte black has been shockingly good at rejecting fingerprints so that's sweet something you might have noticed also is samsung has a carbon fiber weave in the camera module for like every other color of this phone except for phantom black for some reason but luckily for less than two bucks channel sponsored dbrand's got you covered with a carbon fiber camera skin so you can still get that look easy so okay now that i'm done raving about the design the galaxy s21 ultra as a sequel to the s20 ultra is actually largely the same phone it's got a lot of the same big numbers the ultra stuff is still here but there's a lot of small intangibles a lot of small adjustments that they've made that i really like probably more than you think and then like i don't know how to say this without sounding kind of full of it but i feel like this phone was designed by or maybe at least worked on by people who have watched mkbhd videos does that make sense like there's there's a lot of things in here and of course there's a lot of people out there who have the same tastes and will like a lot of these changes in any phone but yeah this this exact phone feels more like an mkbhd edition phone than any phone i've ever reviewed so you gotta start up front with that display this has been a strength of samsung and their phones for years so you can expect good stuff and you see that with the improvements on paper right this is a huge oled that will finally do 1440p resolution and 120 hertz at the same time it gets even brighter up to 1500 nits tops so it's viewable in pretty much any conditions and the new ltpo panel tech makes it actively varied its refresh rate between 10 hertz and 120 hertz to save battery but from my experience has stayed very responsive i've never noticed a dip in frame rate in everyday use so it's managing it really well which is a success but even with all that stuff that's on the spec sheet there's also all the stuff that's not on paper like the fact that they keep flattening the display even more than last year this one doesn't spill over the edges kind of at all anymore obviously like that it's also a little bit smaller and the body of this phone it's still a big phone don't get me wrong but it's not like stupid big like here it is compared to iphone 12 pro max another pretty big phone but it's actually a smaller footprint here and next to the oneplus 8 pro it's still huge but doesn't seem so overbearingly massive right it's actually smaller than the galaxy s20 ultra going from a 6.9 inch to a 6.8 inch display and also the fingerprint sensor is new i guess that would be on paper too but they've switched to a newer generation qualcomm under display fingerprint reader and that reader is noticeably bigger it's 1.77 times the size of last year i didn't notice it being any faster even though it claimed to be but just the larger sensor area by itself makes the experience of using the fingerprint sensor all the time much less frustrating i have less failed attempts it feels less finicky and maybe someday the whole bottom of the phone will be a fingerprint sensor but until then in this world of wearing masks the improved fingerprint reader is welcome so also on paper snapdragon 8 inside 12 or 16 gigs of ram depending on which spec you get fast ufs 3.1 storage not expandable which is technically a downgrade from last year but it's something i haven't personally used in a long time then high refresh rate display and a 5 000 milliamp hour battery so this phone is clearly a flagship performer on paper but off paper there are a lot of improvements to one ui 3 on this phone that do probably make a more meaningful difference to the user experience versus just the bleeding edge specs now i've said before i'm not the biggest fan of samsung's software and their ui honestly i i've preferred close to stock maybe oxygen os is my favorite non-stock option but you can't sleep on samsung software the whole reason they do what they do is to offer as many features as possible and they are still at it there are tons of features packed into these phones that have a lot of potential for customization and just letting you tailor it to behave the way you want you never have to dive in and use any or all of the features because there's a lot but they'll be waiting for you if you have the time to mess with them i think the stuff you'll first notice with s21 ultra is the new volume control here those sliders just a little cleaner looking in one ui three the new notification grouping on top of android just an overall cleaner aesthetic and organization to things like that the stock apps and the improved dark mode that i highly recommend looks great on this oled display and can actually net you a little bit of extra battery life but also the google discover page to the side of the home screen and samsung's launcher what who told them to do that i did not see that coming but hey if i worked at samsung and i kept asking for a google play edition for all these years i guess we know that's probably never going to happen again but this is a little taste to that it's as close as it's going to get i do kind of wish the search box showed up over here too like it does in the google app but hey this is solid and i guess if they let me map bixby to google assistant all over the phone that would have been the cherry on top but anyway speaking of battery we again have an ultra number it's 5 000 milliamp hours and that looks great on paper right in practice i've had a very good battery experience now the thing to note which is an ongoing conversation is the qualcomm snapdragon chip experience versus in other regions there's an exynos version so this year with this phone it would be snapdragon 8 versus the exynos 2100 now the initial testing results show uh pretty promising basically for those who haven't known or haven't been filled in usually the exynos version is much worse with battery life and performance in those regions initial testing is uh pretty promising for the exynos 2100 i'm going to leave that actual conclusion getting to people who can get their hands on both phones but for now with my experience on the qualcomm phone very good battery life on one day i got four hours of screen on time and ended around 50 percent the next day i had around five hours had a little less at the end of the day i never once killed it in a single day it's pretty clear that the combination of the triple h chip and the ltpo display tech are working well here i'd i'd say it has what i'd call a worry-free battery don't even really have to think about it too much with some super heavy use and navigation and bright screen outdoors all the time and gaming taking lots of photos and videos then maybe maybe you'll get to the end of the battery but hey while we're here let's talk cameras they are a big part of the ultra phone experience both figuratively and literally speaking so they hit all the check boxes of big ultra numbers again 108 megapixels 100 times zoom 8k video all that stuff is still here i would say the experience has actually changed more than the photo quality photo quality is still roughly what we'd expect from a high-end samsung phone and i'll get to that in a second but there are more changes to how you get to that photo and video that are better there's countless examples of this so right when you first open the camera app samsung asks you if you want to take natural or bright selfies instead of just defaulting to bright all the time i'm glad they added that option they didn't have to but that results in much more natural selfies from that 40 megapixel camera for someone like me with my skin tone right off the bat instead of having to mess with the exposure slider then the 100x space zoom which yes is definitely extreme and probably still a gimmick to most people it got a lot more stable and easier to use thanks to the subject locking in the viewfinder so now when you're zoomed all the way in on something the camera tries to identify the subject of the photo you're taking and locks the viewfinder to track that instead of shaking around so much it is slightly annoying when you're like locked onto something that's not quite what you're trying to shoot and then you have to try to adjust it probably zoom out and zoom back in but when it correctly picks your subject it's great the results are still insane and not super usable but hey if you were using 100x before you'll be happier with how much easier it is to use in this new version you of course have the laser autofocus added to fix the autofocus issues we saw with the s20 ultra and i'd say in 75 percent of cases it works it sometimes still hunts a little bit with the really close-up subjects but for the most part it's solved and then the camera app also now auto detects when you're trying to take an extreme close-up and switches to macro but it's not a separate macro camera as you may have noticed this phone doesn't have one because it doesn't need one it uses the ultra wide camera which has autofocus and a super close minimum focus distance so it actually takes really solid quality macros and it does 4k 60fps video from all the cameras now including the selfie camera and it'll shoot 12-bit raw photos in pro mode which is an awesome capability that i'll probably rarely actually use personally kind of like the 108 megapixel mode but it's definitely a nice to have they've added things like the director's view which lets you record video from multiple cameras simultaneously which is enabled by the snapdragon 8 potentially really useful for vlog style shooting and the use of two telephoto cameras a 3x and a 10x seemed peculiar at first but i've found it actually makes a lot of sense so like i could live without the 10x and most people also could and the s21s don't have it and that's fine but samsung's committed to offering that quality super far zoom on this phone so if they did the 10x by itself and not the 3x well then everything from 1x to 10x would be digital zoom on the main sensor and that's not ideal so if they only did the 3x and not the 10x well then everything from 3x in that super far range wouldn't be quite up to the ultra standard so they have a 3x and a 10x and so now everything from 1 to 3x is zoom on the primary camera everything from 3x to 10x is either on the primary or the second camera just depending on what the lighting situation is and then everything from 10x and beyond is of course on that little periscope camera and that's delivering some of the best 10x to 30x zoom photos that i'm seeing on any smartphone so that's accomplishing what samsung set out to do now is it perfect no no camera is perfect it still misses shots it still does 8k at only 24 fps the wrong frame rate and most notably it definitely still fringes on the edges with close-up subjects absolutely but overall they've controlled it a lot more with color and hdr and focus and so overall the look is what you'd expect just easier to get so at the end of the day when you go down the list with the s21 ultra they did it like this this is the phone that would have come out the lab if you handed me an s20 ultra and said all right go ahead and make any improvements you want this is what i would have made i would have updated the design i would have flattened out the display i would have added a little google flare to the software the improved camera experience and i would have spent way too much time on a matte black finish and named it phantom black it's kind of the best they've ever done oh and one more thing you might have seen some shots throughout the video of the limited edition icons drop that i did with dbrand a few weeks ago i've also noticed a lot of you guys on twitter who missed out on that limited edition drop so i've been working with the brand on this for a while behind the scenes and now you guessed it icons is back and it's not just limited this time it's back permanently so for all 150 plus devices in their category icons will live on forever in red and black and triple black but then also this is more than just a re-release because we're adding a few things we're adding that red and black mask you saw red code mask and we're also adding a new limited edition colorway called silicon so it's the matte black finish with a matte metallic paint for all the icons looks pretty hot if you ask me now if you're somehow watching this in the future sometime where silicon is over that limited drop happened and you missed the train so sorry but there's also some more limited edition colorways planned in the future so definitely let me know in the comments what other sort of colorways you want to see for icons either way that's been it galaxy s21 ultra very impressive phone very close to what an mkbhd edition might look like what do you think of this phone and also what do you want to see in the s21 review as that will now be in the works either way that's been it thanks for watching catch you guys the next one peace hey guys we're back with the latest scoop samsung is working hard on world's slimmest flip phone with a 120hz refresh rate along with that the world's first foldable smartphone with the under display camera and the official sport for s-pen despite having these amazing features samsung could be incredibly generous when it comes to the price not just for these but also for the upcoming galaxy s21 fe we'll be taking a look at all that but first let's talk about the state of under display camera that could make the next galaxy note 2022 lineup special so in the previous video we discussed how the galaxy s22 lineup could potentially miss on the under display camera as samsung isn't satisfied or confident with the mass production yield and the result of the image quality now we got some more information on why this could happen according to ross young the current under display camera that samsung will be using on the fold three has no transparent cathode region which means it's gonna have that visible mosiac pattern in certain situations so the next gen under display camera with transparent cathode region is expected to happen in the second half of 2022 which means it's right around the timeline for the next galaxy note lineup which by the way will come according to the famous words of dj co the note series will come back perhaps the last time so a true next-gen under display camera could make the note 3 stand out compared to the galaxy s22 lineup unlike the galaxy z4 3 samsung cannot take any risk when it comes to the front camera of the s22 lineup because all three cameras of the fall 3 can be used as selfie sensors whereas the s22 series will have just one front camera and that has to be on the absolute good level the quality has to absolutely match the selfie performance of the current s21 ultra's front camera and if that doesn't happen then samsung will absolutely delay it till they do it right with the note series samsung recently said that the stretchable display is the next big thing after the foldable smartphones they also trademark words like galaxy roll and galaxy slide but this could actually take some time and it might not match the launch timing so a full next-gen transparent under display camera setup has to happen and if it doesn't happen in the s22 lineup then it makes all the sense for the note series to come out with the under display camera let me know what you think about this in the comment section below also in the news samsung is becoming super super generous literally all of their upcoming devices including the s21 fe z flip 3 and z flow 3 all are rumored to be cheaper starting with the galaxy s21 fv it could be about 80 to 100 cheaper than the last year's s20 fe that is indeed a huge price prediction and by the way what you're looking at right now are the official final colors of the s21 fe lineup courtesy of everleax so once again samsung is providing variety of colors as for the z flip 3 and the fold 3 samsung could make them about 20 percent cheaper than the previous lineup which is actually pretty hard to believe but it's coming via sam mobile based on what they have reported it's actually a significant price reduction compared to samsung's previous generations i really hope that it's true now lastly we'll be taking a look at the front renders of the z-flip 3 this is something that we have not seen in the leaked official trailer images these are renders from ice universe and you can see the bezels are super slim it's also going to be the first flip smartphone to have a 120 hertz refresh rate so that's all the latest news the next gen udc makes perfect sense for the next galaxy note lineup if the s22 lineup doesn't come with udc will that bother you or will you wait for the node lineup drop your comments and i'll see you guys later peace out [Music] hello everyone i'm ella and welcome so i recently bought my sister her very first phone which is the purple iphone 12 and just in case you're wondering why i got her the iphone 12 it's because she specifically told me that she wanted an iphone so that she can imessage and airdrop with her friends so yeah that is the very simple reason for why i got her an iphone now i myself have the samsung s21 and in the past i've actually talked about why i decided to go with a samsung phone instead of an iphone but now since i do have an actual iphone in my hands i thought that i would give it a fair and proper review from my perspective as a samsung and android user okay so the very first thing that i want to talk about is just how expensive this phone is the iphone 12 is seriously expensive even in comparison with its direct competitors so just a quick example the iphone 12 and the samsung s21 are very much direct competitors and i feel like most people think that these two phones are actually the same price but they really are not the iphone 12 and s21 base models are both 7.99 however the iphone 12 base model is 64 gigabytes whereas the samsung s21 base model is 128 gigabytes and if you want the iphone 12 to have 128 gigabytes then that's 50 extra so that puts us at 849 but if you also don't want the iphone 12 to come with a sim card then that's an extra 30 which i really don't understand like why do i have to pay extra if i just want to use my own sim card in this thing but anyways so the s21 with 128 gigabytes and no sim card already in it is 799 and if we want the iphone 12 to have the same exact specs that will actually cost 879 which is significantly more and also buying an s21 actually comes with a few pretty nice perks including four months of youtube premium i actually still have youtube premium from buying this phone and it is pretty nice and also both apple and samsung have special education discount programs however iphones are actually excluded from that which i don't really understand because many students do need phones on the other hand the s21 is very much included in the program so i was actually able to get my s21 for around 759 so yeah as you guys can see even against arguably its most famous competitor the iphone 12 is still significantly more expensive all right so now you may be wondering what kind of great amazing accessories come with this 900 plus phone because there's packs well you get a single usbc to lightning cable this thing right here as well as an apple sticker and yeah that is all that's in there you don't get a wall charger because apple says that everyone already has one and they're trying to save the environment but actually it's very unlikely that a first time phone user like my sister will have a compatible wall charger and even if many people already did have wall chargers it's more likely that they are quite old so they can only charge at 5 watts which is really slow for these modern phones the iphone 12 actually needs a 20 watt charger in order to charge at its maximum speed and practically nobody besides laptop users will have a charging brake that can charge at 20 watts even the ipad charger can only charge at 18 watts and like i do have a 20 watt charger because i have a macbook but i don't want to share that thing between my laptop and my phone that is just very inconvenient the apple isn't the only company doing this samsung also didn't include a wall charger with its s21 phones even though the s21 phones can charge at 25 watts so that just means that you're basically forced to spend more money if you want to use one of the most important features of these new phones which is fast charging and that kind of really sucks because these new phones are already hella expensive i really do hope that this will change in the future all right now let's talk about the actual phone itself the purple color is super gorgeous looking and also it has flat edges i remember my first phone which was an iphone 5s also had flat edges so it seems like these flat edges have made a comeback and i do like them so not complaining now as for the screen it does look really good it is a 6.1 inch oled screen and its resolution is between 1080 and 2k just for reference the iphone 11 had an lcd screen with below 1080p resolution so the iphone 12 screen is definitely a big improvement typically oled screens have much better color and contrast than lcd screens and they would be very good for hdr videos which i am beginning to see on youtube however the kind of unfortunate thing is that the screen refresh rate is only 60 hertz and especially coming from my s21 which does have a 120 hertz refresh rate the iphone 12 with 60 hertz just doesn't feel as smooth especially when scrolling the difference is especially noticeable with 120 hertz i can still see the text clearly when scrolling whereas with 60 hertz when i'm scrolling at about the same rate i can't really and here's another instance where i can see the difference pretty clearly when i'm switching between the pages i can tell that the 120 hertz screen does look smoother now i just want to clarify that 60 hertz is completely fine it does not feel laggy or anything especially if you're not coming from a 120 hertz screen however 120 hertz is just like a premium 120 hertz does give a noticeably better and smoother experience so i do wish that the iphone 12 had 120 hertz okay and next i wanted to talk about customization on the iphone over the past few days i did force my sister to let me play with her phone so i did pretty extensively experiment around with different widgets and also customizing the app icons and i have to say i really like the look of the widgets and you can also download apps like widget smith and color widgets that will give you very aesthetic looking widgets [Music] however the one thing that i found that really disappointed me is that the widgets are not interactive at all they really can only display information or just simply act as a piece of decoration on your phone and there are some widgets that i feel like just should be interactive but they're not for example the spotify calendar and reminder widgets are all very much interactive on my s21 phone and they should be like it totally makes sense for them to be interactive however on the iphone 12 they are not interactive they are essentially just like big buttons they do look really nice but they just lack functionality which is certainly a bit disappointing okay and as for customizing the app icons this went completely viral when ios 14 first came out everyone loved this and was doing it but there actually used to be this problem where it would take you to the shortcuts page first and then it would open the app which is obviously not ideal since you would want to be directly taken to the app but the good news is apple did fix it 90 so now what happens is when you tap on one of these custom icons you get taken directly to the app but then you get a notification pop-up from the shortcuts app now i really dislike and don't understand this like apple saw how iphone users loved being able to customize their app icons so then they decided to optimize that experience and they did but only 90 of the way they still leave an annoying 10 which is the little pop-up notification thing and like yes the little pop-up notification is less annoying than before but it is still pretty annoying and if this were my iphone i certainly would not be customizing my apps just because i value functionality over aesthetics so yeah my overall thoughts about iphone customization is that you can make it super pretty the most aesthetic and pinterest worthy thing possible but the customizations just lack functionality and just quickly mentioning android customization on my android phone i can quickly apply a theme which does make the phone very very aesthetic looking and also the design of all the widgets are very nice and many of the widgets are interactive now there are some features that the iphone 12 does have that i like that my s21 does not have i really like how on the iphone i can hide a screen i'll show you what i mean by that right now [Music] [Music] so [Music] and also the app library is automatically organized for you i think that's a pretty nice feature [Music] and of course we need to talk about the cameras of these two phones so the iphone only has two lenses one of them is the regular lens that can go up to five times zoom and the second one is the ultra wide lens my s21 does have three lenses a regular lens an ultra wide lens as well as a telephoto lens which actually allows the s21 to zoom up to 30 times obviously photos taken at a very high zoom don't look very good however i think that this feature can be helpful when you're trying to read a sign that's very far away or if you're a student and you'd like to sit at the very very back of the lecture hall well when we have in person learning again and you cannot see the whiteboard then you can use your 30 times zoom to see what's going on but yeah other than that i really can't think of another advantage of the incredibly high zoom i did take some photos and videos using both phones and now i will show you the results okay so photo quality wise both are definitely great i feel like the s21 produces more vibrant colors but depending on your preferences this could be considered either a feature or a bug for the ultrawides i forgot to make the aspect ratios the same so please forgive me for that but i think the ultrawides on both phones look amazing with a 120 degree field of view [Music] the iphone selfie cam looks really good and it even blurs the background slightly in a very natural looking way that i really like [Music] the s21 selfie cam is very decent as well but it doesn't really blur the background so i think in terms of the selfie cam i would prefer the iphone over the s21 now the iphone zoom is really not it the s21 has much better zoom because it does have the third telephoto lens whereas the iphone does not and as for the portrait mode so the best way that i can describe this is that it just looks like phone portrait you know it's not always perfect i feel like the background blur and the subject just look a bit too jarring which then makes it quite obvious that this was produced by a phone and not a real camera the s21 portrait is really not any better again the contrast between the subject and the background is quite jarring and sometimes the s21 just like misses completely so i would say use the foam portrait at your own risk sometimes your photos will just come out really wonky looking and that's why i personally don't really use the foam portrait at all just because there is a fairly high chance that it will not turn out well oh man okay now let's talk about the night mode so um the iphone just like completely failed like i don't look like this i promise you guys and neither does my sweatshirt my sweatshirt is not reflective at all so i don't know if it's because i'm wearing this bright white sweatshirt that caused the iphone to fail but in this instance the iphone night mode failed pretty miserably the s21 night mode turned out much better i look much more normal looking and i think the quality looks pretty good and lastly the video quality so the iphone video is really nice it's very smooth and clear the s21 video is also pretty good but i would say it's not as smooth and clear looking as the iphones especially when i'm moving the phone the image becomes kind of blurry so video wise i would say the iphone is slightly better than the s21 alright and now i want to talk about some features that the iphone doesn't have that i certainly do miss and the first one is google assistant the iphone 12 does have a siri which is i guess like the equivalent but google assistant is much better than siri when it comes to smart home control there are just far more smart home devices that support google assistant compared to siri and yes of course you can download the cool assistant app on the iphone however you will have to open up the app every time you want to use google assistant which just makes it not very convenient on my phone i can just say okay google turn on my lights okay turning the tree lights on i think siri is okay it's cool but google assistant is just more useful okay and the other feature that i wish the iphone did have is a feature that's similar to smart lock on android phones on my s21 i can set it so that when my phone is on me or in a trusted place or near a trusted device like my smart watch then it will be unlocked and currently on the iphone the only way to unlock it without using the face id and the passcode is with an apple watch so that is better than nothing but the options are not as many as on my s21 okay so that's going to be it for this video overall i do think that the iphone is a great and fantastic phone if i didn't then i wouldn't have bought it for my sister iphones can last a while and they also have really good resale value so i think they are a safe choice for many people but i just think that my samsung s21 has certain features that are just better like the 120 hertz refresh rate as well as the customizability and yeah that's it that is my iphone review if you've enjoyed this video then please give it a thumbs up and also be sure to subscribe to my channel down below to

Muhammad [Music] [Music] all right it is already that time of the year we really didn't miss a beat huh we got new samsung stuff so samsung just revealed the galaxy s21 and s21 plus and i've got your first hands-on and some impressions of them right here i also just dropped a separate video on the big dog the galaxy s21 ultra definitely check that out if you're interested it's the flagship of their flagships and that video will be the first link below the like button but for these two s21 and s21 plus here we have some very interesting new numbers new specs and new prices now there are two new phones i'm talking about here like i said so i figure i might as well talk about the differences between them usually it's basically two different phones that are just different sizes and that's it this time it's two different phones that are different sizes and also different materials so the smaller s21 comes in at 6.2 inches while the s21 plus comes in at 6.7 which is almost the same size as the ultra and they look and feel pretty close in size but individually like once you hold them you can really tell a difference and that also of course with the size difference means the space inside is different so that's a different battery 4 000 milliamp hours on the s21 4800 on the s21 plus that's pretty impressive and then yes materials so the s21 plus has a matte finish over glass and the s21 has a matte finish over polycarbonate aka plastic and so those two things are all that account for the difference in price but it is a 200 difference in price now the s21 starts at 7.99 this year and so the s21 plus starts at 9.99 now this plastic versus glass thing i i found it a little bit strange at first that they would separate it like that i figured they'd either make both plastic or both glass but i guess because they are coming down in price to 7.99 with the galaxy s21 i can let it slide plus plastic like i've said before it has a weird reputation it's not actually that bad it just seems cheap in more expensive phones but it's less likely to shatter you can mess with colors more and ultimately they actually look very similar you can just tell the s21 is a little bit lighter in your hand so this is definitely something i'll dig into more in the full review but yeah everything else here about these is the same and pretty new mainly centered around this new contour cut design where the camera cut out as you can see is all the way up in this ridge platform thing in the corner like i said in the ultra video i kind of like it not gonna lie i think it looks pretty futuristic but it definitely stands out the most with this purple color here where the camera cutout is gold and then that gold wraps all the way around the sides and the rails of the phone so it's kind of like a two-piece suit it's looking kind of like a superhero costume or something i don't know i wish there were more versions of color combos that you could choose from maybe red and black would have been cool too maybe black and white black and yellow but either way it's a unique look for sure i'll give them that it doesn't really resemble anything else i've seen and i'm into that there's no copying but on the inside we're going to start to see a lot of phones kind of like this one so it's the snapdragon 888 chip in this region or it'll be the new five nanometer exynos chip in other regions and i definitely want to see if there are any big differences between them with this generation but they are promising 20 to 35 percent faster performance on cpu and graphics respectively there is eight gigs of ram in each like i said and either 128 or 256 gigs of storage this time not expandable now that is a bummer not just because you are now limited to 256 gigs of storage but it's also another removed feature from last year technically we had expandable storage in a micro sd card slot now it's gone we had glass now it's plastic the triple camera situation on the back is pretty standard they share the same 12 megapixel primary camera 12 megapixel ultra wide and 64 megapixel 3x telephoto camera that will zoom all the way into 30x space zoom if you want not quite the 100x of the ultra but it does appear to be much more stable than before and samsung says it'll focus faster and then the displays up front got an interesting update this year i'm not going to call them upgrade because again they did technically lose another feature so this year the displays are now adaptive refresh rates so they will refresh between 48 hertz and 120 hertz depending on what's on the screen and that should save you some battery instead of just being locked at 120 most of the time but also the displays are now 1080p so they used to be 1440p for a couple years in a row of samsung flagships now they're 1080p now i know they dropped the price but now you're talking plastic you're talking no expandable storage you're talking 1080p instead of 1440p and again it's not that big of a deal because a lot of people like me were using their phones at 120 hertz in 1080p already anyway so it's in theory not something we should notice or care that much about it's already around 400 dpi for that resolution on that size of the screen anyway but it's just a little thing you don't like getting less than last year so it's technically an update but i'm not going to call that an upgrade until i test it more then the rest of the changes are pretty minor but all pretty positive at least in my opinion so there's a 1.77 times larger and hopefully also faster fingerprint reader underneath the glass there's a couple new software features built into the camera like a more advanced director's mode for video and the recording audio from multiple sources and things like that that's all good stuff but yeah it's really mainly just a spec bump in a new design with a couple tweaks that allow them to lower the price down to 7.99 and i do like that lowered price i think that is a good move but it's just gonna depend on how you feel about the stuff they cut out but now you pretty much know everything you need to know about the newly announced galaxy s21s clearly the ultra has a lot more going on so again if you haven't seen that video it's also live check it out but let me know what you think is this the change you want to see and does that lower starting price make you happy and maybe there's a fan edition later this year we'll see either way thanks for watching i'll catch you guys in the next one peace [Music] do [Music] [Music] [Music] do [Music] do

google on memorial day being too broke to buy a pc selling your little brother fair change spare change ma'am [Music] hi guys this is ranjit and in this video we're going to look at the samsung 4k monitor and guys this is not just a normal monitor this is actually a smart monitor and as you can see it works like a normal monitor you connect your pc extra but at a touch of a button you get actually a remote with this one touch of a button it converts itself to a smart tv and it has a full full-length smart tv functionality we have a look at it even voice controls are there for example if i press this voice command what's the weather like it is mostly cloudy and 29 degrees right now so it's actually pretty interesting uh it can connect to wireless displays and stuff and i've been actually testing this one for the last couple of weeks so let's have a closer look at the same now so guys uh this is the monitor and this is the 4k variant known as m7 and this is a 32 inch monitor i thought it would be too big but i got used to it after a couple of days in fact i'm liking this size now and right now it's acting like a traditional monitor i'll show you the ports in fact it has two hdmi ports at the back one type c port also and two usb ports so that you can connect actually keyboards and mouse etc in fact as this is a smart uh what do you say monitor you get a full functional remote with this one it's a bluetooth remote and this is a smart monitor hence it connects to via wi-fi also both 2.4 and 5 gigahertz is supported bluetooth is there and again as you can see it has the smart apps and all those things that are available so touch of a button you can go back to your what do you say work stuff that is windows or just go back to uh this one and this is a 4k let me just log into windows it's just logged in and your traditional windows works it's a 4k 60 uh hertz monitor it's a va panel guys to be precise it's actually a sp va panel and again as i told you this is that 32 inch size we also get an m5 variant that's a 1080p variant of this one another thing that i like with this monitor is that i was working quite a bit on this one and i like that uh even when you are sitting at the monitor it's very near though it's a very big monitor i was not having any eye strain in fact it automatically adjusts the brightness quite a bit automatically and in fact it has a sensor uh inside that automatically continuously adjusts the brightness and contrast so you don't have to worry though it's a very big monitor it does not hurt your eyes now as i've told you uh this is the monitor part you can just press this remote and this moves to your smart tv for example your youtube apps and all these things if you just press and as you can see youtube has loaded uh it also has built-in speakers actually that's nice let's just go to my own channel so here is my video and i'm lowering the volume as you can see it goes very loud in fact the volume level is very loud and just notice navigation guys i'm using the remote very fast to actually navigate within the ui also again i'll just press home and let's just switch to let's say netflix and i like the interface as you can see how quickly it's loading stuff so that way it works like a proper what do you say television in fact uh if i just go back it's going to play let me just go back if i press home you can go to the settings here and if you look at it this looks like a traditional tv settings in fact that we have and the sound quality is actually really good let me um try to play a trailer and give you an idea so let's play this trailer and i'm going to increase the volume a little bit [Music] and just notice the picture quality also so again as you can see the picture quality is good uh the navigation speed is very fast it does not feel like they have compromised on anything as you can see just moving it and it even has a what do you say app store if i go over here apps this is the app store where you can install uh your apps or whatever you want for example i'm just gonna get exit from that so full functionality i would say of this one you can move the apps you can pin it here your whatever favorite for example if you go over here you see your apps let's say i want to bring jio cinema over here i can just go here add to home and that will come here so this works like a traditional samsung television i would say and the interface is good uh regarding connectivity as i've told you it's really good one thing i really liked on this one and i was skeptical about this one again hdmi we have two hdmi ports as i've mentioned you have remote access and this is actually really good on this one but before that uh let me actually also show you this i am actually impressed genuinely impressed let me just go to uh what do you say youtube the voice commands works very well this remote is supplied and if you press this you can use the voice command and i'm just going to use it switch to netflix and as you can see it works connect to remote access and as you can see here here what i like this you can remotely connect to a pc that might not be in this physical location uh you can easily connect that and i also like the fact that you can do screen sharing and stuff for example i'll disconnect this laptop that was connected and right now if i go back to hdmi uh it's nothing is connected source as you can see i have disconnected so what we'll do is this is the laptop here it's not connected and i'm going to wirelessly connect it and this works actually really well very easy to do if you have a what do you say a windows 10 uh pc you just hit the connect option and it's going to search it from this monitor if i click on it this is wireless guys it's just going to connect in a second connecting and now i am connected to this monitor wirelessly so this actually works very well on this one and i was also very surprised that this works very well even with max here is an example so guys this is my macbook air i'm going to wirelessly connect this one now so i just selected it basically uses airplay 2 and as you can see now this is connected and yeah here i have i can control my stuff do it and this i'm doing completely wireless so i was very happy genuinely how well this remote connectivity functionality work even you can use your smartphones to actually uh connect so guys i've disconnected so you go back to this one and again you have your apps over here so you can use it like a traditional television and i like how fluid the operation is i thought it would be janky or something but again the performance as you can see is actually really good and in fact the speakers are also very loud some ad is coming the speakers are also very loud on this one so generally i feel this is a two in one device and even the smart functionality works very well uh in fact in remote access if i go here uh you can even connect uh using samsung dex and even you can access office 365 as i've told you we also have usb port so you can connect a keyboard and a mouse to this one and even without a pc connected you can use it for example uh it's connected to my office 365 account and it's gonna connect or wi-fi as you can see i can access all my documents and go over here i'll just get out of this one so you have this office 365 built-in i'm just going to exit so this kind of functionality is there and even samsung dex is built into this one let me give you an idea uh let me just connect to samsung dex i have the food and i'm going to just use samsung dex and i can mirror this one my smartphone and it's just going to yeah it detected this monitor and i'm just going to hit start and as you can see now my entire smartphone interface is over here and we can actually use this smartphone to actually control uh this one and i can just click here as my mouse is not connected and now this my as you can see the mouse is moving this phone acts as a mouse pointer and you can access entire things what is there on your phone in this sort of interface uh so basically your smartphone is powering this is the dex functionality that we have i'm just going to exit out of this and go back to the monitor so guys uh this was the samsung smart monitor this is the n7 model uh that's a 4k variant that comes with 32 inches there's also one more video that's the m5 that's a 1080p variant what i'll do is i'll leave the links in the description below and i feel this is a very unique product and ideal for current situations like work from home where we are forced to work but after we have finished work it will be great if that device converts to entertainment device and this is actually does that so this is a very unique monitor in fact actually like that and many of the advanced functionality that it promises actually work on this one so that way i like this product and this is a review unit and i don't see this often but i might be purchasing this one for myself because of that functionality what it offers so but anyways what do you guys think about this one do let me know in the comment section below uh that's it for now thanks for watching and if you guys are still not subscribed to my youtube channel hit that subscribe button this is ranjit and i hope to see you in my next video take care guys war has changed before it used to be about camera control processor changes location access what what's that oh sorry we gotta it's not metal gear solid four now it ain't that ain't that gucci ladies and gentlemen we got good old-fashioned samsung creating the hottest new virtual assistant ever enough my camera wants to focus ladies and gentlemen the topic for today is samsung sam is the virtual mobile assistant real and as you all know in today's day and age with every smartphone every company has their own ai assistant google has google voice amazon has alexa apple has siri and you know samsung decides to come along with bixby representing the intellectually disabled in terms of ai where uh this this actual ai hey bixby doesn't even want to open it's oh i actually decided to listen this time can't set up an alarm for god's sake so i absolutely despise now ladies and gentlemen as much as a joke bixby is samsung has decided to somewhat go in a new direction with different ais leading down into the future now what we're about to look at is an official in fact i'm pretty sure it's scrapped at this point and it's scrapped because the internet's horny levels were a bit too high so what's the meme in particular well ladies and gentlemen this cute girl right over here that's apparently that was apparently samsung sam at one point now there have been a few photos floating around as you can gauge this character right over here was a cute little you know 3d avatar assistant for the mobile phones apparently at some point in production of course she's got you know cute smile pixar level designs a great little samsung galaxy phone and the ability to take kawaii selfies of course the internet is the internet and if you go one reply down again literally less than two scrolls you know one that's less than two scrolls that mean that means people are down bad i sense an upheaval in the rule 34 force as if a hundred thousand voices cried out suddenly yes [Laughter] ladies and gentlemen let's go look at some good old-fashioned samsung same if you go on youtube and just type her in you'll probably find a lot of oh ooh we down battle galactically i see here let's let's just go on to one that looks simple sam assistiente virtual day samsung 2021 oh [ __ ] you go a little bit above my god she ain't wearing a thing god damn of course if you go look at any of these videos they've already got like straight up fan cams i've seen look at her look at her she look at look at cute little samsung saying man there's no way there's no way of course you can see that the full body samsung sam has opposed to commandeer but i ain't going to stop somebody from saying oof la nueva waifu clearly attracting everyone from all cultures beyond everywhere so let's just go around a little further obviously polygon have to you know make that good old post predictably people want to [ __ ] samsung's rejected ai mascot id censored the word over there to add the full impact of what we're looking at she is not an official product of samsung objection all right this one guy actually dug up the wayback machine to prove that this apparently was real at some point apparently you get to a blank page because they removed the archives but this is from like a group named chael which said that they partnered alongside this company called light farm where they actually redesigned sam samsung's virtual assistant from a 2d version to 3d dude and then if you go one page over you can see that chanel is apparently owned by samsung themselves so i don't know there's a lot of conflicting [ __ ] flying around point is this picture was discovered by users a couple days ago me included and within two hours of me finding this photo like the actual ai mascot i came across literal [ __ ] porn of her okay like just straight up rule 34 to the point where like um some of it was pretty good like i'm i'm gonna get full ratings over here some of it was like pretty pretty embarrassingly bad now of course if you go look around have you all seen samsung's new virtual assistant oh i have i have indeed and you can kind of tell these photos have to be a little bit real like just look at that look look at look at her galaxy drip right now all right you can't tell me samsung didn't know what they were doing yo someone in marketing knew what they were doing they deserve a [ __ ] raise look at that one look at that i'm more interested in that cutie than the phone itself god damn oh she gives us hope man i feel like working out today you see that bam you're out there working that's the best motivation you need if you don't work out you're gonna get your ai replaced by bixby and do you want that no one wants that samantha samsung ooh it's an epic production ooh look at that one the only straight-up got a fan cam look at that i mean she is from south korea so it makes some sense right god damn now i actually believe this is kind of real so if you if you're looking at this right now this is something called neon you can actually check it out at neon.life if you're noticing that these are samsung phones you're right absolutely they are samsung phones if you're noticing this weird like uncanny valley 3d avatar that you're talking to apparently at some point or like samsung is actually working on an ai that you can video call and talk to which would be incredibly weird if that was the case i must say but hey i mean i'm glad that people are championing the future of software and creepy you know data gathering in that respect i love how like when you go to samsung sam it goes to rule 24 showing that the internet is so goddamn horny that they had dick in one hand and fat fingered the key to get access to those hot juicy rule 34s and to show you where i actually found the rule 34 it's a little it's a little insane it's a little wild all right i literally found it off of 4chan like as long as you go to 4chan slash r you'll just try to find whatever the [ __ ] you want and this is the longest thread of ai pornography you have ever seen imaginable now if you didn't know the internet was horny enough there's even a subreddit known as r samsung girl r34 oh boy post sam samsung's virtual assistant yeah 45.5 000 degenerates are currently hovering onto this [ __ ] there's already 11 000 people beating their meat right now as we speak to this wild-ass samsung nonsense so yeah ladies and gentlemen the greatest greatest lev wow wow wow no shock content that's [ __ ] up ladies and gentlemen this is a wild meme to me honestly i never knew that a pixar level samsung avatar could cause the internet to break this much but this is some of the funniest stuff that i've seen especially in a year where it seems like it wants to be a sequel to 2020 the awful meme behind us but you know this isn't a redemption arc for the year i don't really know what is so ladies and gentlemen knowing that this is a rejected mascot can we please ca samsung can we please actually have this in their phones it might be the one cool software update if anything do something to replace bixby okay it is without a doubt one of the worst ais the fact that samsung hasn't taken bixby out to a nice sunset and put a [ __ ] bullet in it is beyond me ladies and gentlemen here's cheers to sam samsung sam for god that is such a weird tongue twister in a way ladies and gentlemen this is me mudahar and if you've been down galactically bad know that at least in some capacity you've never been down so galactively bad that you've been jacking off to an ai assistant that being said if you like what you saw please like comment and subscribe dislike it if you dislike it i am out
