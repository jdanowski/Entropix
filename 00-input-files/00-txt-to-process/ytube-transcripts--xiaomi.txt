[Music] um yes [Music] three so yes [Music] three [Music] um [Music] yes [Music] hmm so yes three [Music] so [Music] is [Music] three you [Music] this is one of the most common issues faced by some of the Xiaomi devices in this problem you see a headphone icon in the status by even though you include your head jack so to fix they should go to settings of your device we are look for option in sound and vibrations open it now scroll down and click on audio settings now plug in your head jack here under choose headphone types choose any of your headphone type references it doesn't matter now once done let me plug your headphone jack and you will see that that phone icon has been gone I hope the videos Xiaomi was started in 2010. Today, it’s one of the world’s
most popular smartphones. In India, it’s number one. So, I’ve come to its headquarters here in
Beijing to understand just how this company grew so rapidly and how it
can maintain its momentum. Xiaomi’s rise has been meteoric. Just nine years after it was founded
and one year after going public, the Chinese company became the youngest
member of the Fortune Global 500. The tech giant is best
known for its smartphones. It’s the world’s fourth most popular smartphone
maker, behind Samsung, Huawei and Apple. But Xiaomi doesn’t
just make phones. Walk into one of Xiaomi’s more than 1,000 global
stores, and you’ll find an array of different devices. Almost anything you can imagine,
they sell here in the Xiaomi store. I see virtual reality, walkie talkies, this device
translates languages, like Chinese to English, voice assistants and smart home
speakers, wearables and even tools. Did I mention they sell everything? Since its early days, Xiaomi’s founders
dreamed of an international footprint. And now, it’s one of a hand full of Chinese companies
who have managed to do what many couldn’t. It broke out of its home
market and went global. Xiaomi’s headcount has grown from about 100 in
2010 to a whopping 17,000 staff members today. This is company orientation where employees learn
about the corporate history and corporate culture before they begin in their roles, and just by
the looks of it, this is quite a lot of people. Its global headquarters in Beijing is
home to about 12,000 employees. I’ve come to Xiaomi’s brand-new headquarters
and it’s so new that you can still see them putting on the finishing touches around
the building and at the base of this lobby you actually see this,
it’s the Xiaomi store. The first thing that I think of when I see this
store, well, it reminds me of an Apple Store. We are different, we are very,
very different than Apple. Xiang Wang is Xiaomi’s Global Senior Vice President
and head of the company’s international business. Apple is a great company, they do
a lot of technology innovation. We are doing the same,
but our model is different. We want to sell as low as possible
instead of selling at a premium price. That business model originates from Xiaomi’s
founder, Chinese entrepreneur Lei Jun. Lei Jun's vision was to create
a premium smartphone that could compete with the likes of Apple and
Samsung, but at a more affordable price. This allowed Xiaomi to tap into China’s
growing lower end smartphone market, and it wasn’t long before
it did the same abroad. Just look at this graph. In 2015, six percent of Xiaomi’s total revenues
came from outside Mainland China. By 2018, that grew to 40%. The aim? To eventually have half of its total revenue
coming from outside its borders. Xiaomi has achieved that by expanding
into more than 80 markets. but it’s India that is its biggest
overseas success story to date. It launched in the world’s second most populous
country in 2014 where it held flash sales to generate hype
around their phones. It worked. You only entered India
less than four years ago, and you’ve become the number one
smartphone maker, how did that happen? We offer very, very high-performance device,
with a very, very affordable price. Before us, if you want to buy this
smartphone, it was very, very expensive. Our model is to make the best
product but sell as low as possible. That helped Xiaomi pull ahead of Samsung to
become India’s top smartphone brand in 2018. While it still holds today, Chinese rival, BBK
Electronics, which backs Vivo, Oppo and Realme, could be challenging
Xiaomi’s market dominance. Outside of India and China, there’s
an additional 400 retail outlets, including locations in Dubai,
Barcelona, London and Mexico City. We opened our first store in Mexico
City and 4,000 people showed up. Wang argues Xiaomi's fan culture is what helps set
the company apart from other low-cost competitors. From launch events to meet-ups
for gadget enthusiasts, there have been more than
1,000 Xiaomi fan events to date. Here you have an entire wall dedicated to
fans, things that fans have sent to Xiaomi. We always receive
many, many gifts. Normally they are
technology geeks. A boy and a girl, they met
during our fans event. So the couple in Indonesia met at a Xiaomi
event and named their child, Xiaomi. But the Chinese tech company has
had its share of challenges, too, from temporarily withdrawing from Brazil to losing a trademark case in Europe
against Apple over the name of its tablet. And of course there’s the elephant
in the room, the United States. Xiaomi has long-said it plans
to expand into the U.S. market, but those plans seem to be on hold
thanks to the U.S.-China trade war. U.S. President Donald Trump has openly
scrutinized Xiaomi’s home-grown tech rival, Huawei on multiple occasions. The U.S. market, there
were talks about 2019? The U.S. market actually is, I think in no doubt,
is the most important market, for everyone. We are still very, very young. The
U.S. market is very, very different. We are working very hard trying to design a product for
the U.S. market but still, resources is the big issue. Xiaomi made its name with the
smartphone, but it, like its competitors, is having to diversify as the
smartphone era’s peak winds down. Smartphone shipments have declined for
nine consecutive quarters here in China. So for Xiaomi to continue to grow, it sees its ambitions
beyond the smartphone and beyond China. Actually, we are much more
than a smartphone company. We are the largest consumer
IoT brand in the world. The company is putting much of its
energy into the home of the future. From smart rice cookers
to smart door locks, our homes are going high-tech and
Xiaomi wants to ride that wave. It says it has more than 190
million connected IoT devices. There’s five ways that I can
enter through this smart door. First is through my phone electronically
using something like NFC or bluetooth. And then there’s a number pad,
where I can input a number, there’s also a traditional keyhole here but I’m going
to be super unique and try my fingerprint. There we go. It’s also taking on Samsung and LG with
the launch of this smart refrigerator, which can catagorize your groceries,
play music and even take notes. Xiaomi hopes that every room will
have one of its AI Smart speakers, including the bedroom, so the moment I
walk in, the lights automatically turn on. Let’s see if she recognizes
me with an accent. I got her to recognize me and
she just said, "What’s up?" Earlier when I walked into
the room she told me, "Welcome back home, you
must be very tired, go to sleep." She has quite a personality. The Mi AI Speaker is Xiaomi’s answer to
the Google Home or the Amazon Echo. While Xiaomi sold nearly three million smart
speakers in the second quarter of 2019, it still trails behind its Chinese
rivals Baidu and Alibaba. This store was open just about two years ago, but
one of the first things I noticed is just across from it, Xiaomi is preparing to open a brand-new
space but this one will be focused on lifestyle products and things
related to the smart home. While many of these products carry the Xiaomi
name, not all are actually made by Xiaomi. Take for instance, air purifier
company SmartMi. It’s one of the 270 startups
that Xiaomi invests in. Xiaomi helped SmartMi in significant ways
because we use Xiaomi channel to sell products. Its products are sold in Xiaomi stores
but also, through its own channels, too. SmartMi has grown to become China’s
number one selling air purifier. Consumers will know, "This product
is really good, its from Xiaomi. Oh, they also have their
own brand called SmartMi." SmartMi even hopes
to one day go public. And just like Xiaomi, SmartMi is pushing
for success outside of China too. Right now 41,000 of your products are being
used in India, and you can track this in real time. Right. It’s startups like this that have helped
push Xiaomi’s international reach. How do you continue
the momentum? You have to keep the
innovating spirit. The smartphone market is very, very, very competitive.
You have to do a lot of exciting things everyday. Xiaomi turns 10 years old next year and in
under a decade it’s been able to do what many companies here in this country
haven’t done, succeed outside of China. But just how big this company can
get, well that’s anybody’s guess. Hey guys, it's Uptin.
Thanks for watching! Check out more of our videos and
let us know in the comments, what do you think about
Xiaomi's rise in global tech? While you're at it, subscribe to our
channel and I'll see you next time. this is the xiaomi mi 11 ultra a smartphone with the world's largest camera bump within this camera bump however as well as the three cameras there is a second display this can show you things like the time a photo screen saver but most importantly it can be used as a viewfinder for selfies with the main rear cameras including the ultra wide pretty awesome subscribe for more videos like this Hello, very good to all, welcome to your house, welcome to the top of the range and welcome to the complete analysis of be xiaomi my 11, we have been using the device for a week now, since chatting with him for a few days intensively, you already know that we did a boxing or A contact with some details that you loved, the truth was that it had a lot of visits and it almost got number one in trends in Spain so there was a lot of desire to xiao me my 11 well today we come with a complete review is a review of the long ones we are going to tell you the best the worst what we liked the most what we liked the least about the top-of-the-range phone for now from the Chinese manufacturer, well let's go there and start with the aesthetic section for the design because it is It is true that there are a few things to count on the one hand the dimensions 16 with 4 centimeters high 8 with 1 millimeters thick and 196 grams you already know that I personally my opinion of Carlos before grac I like smaller phones but the truth is that despite being a very large phone the dimensions of the thickness and the weight I think are quite well achieved also of the things that annoy me about the large phones especially it is the psoe when we also find some that have more battery but that exceed 220 grams and others seems like a tough talk so well I think they have done a quite interesting exercise despite being a large phone that they do not lose the pot with the weight colors in this case we have a gray we have a blue and a white finish we have this bluish greyish that depends on how we tilt it, they give us the slightly yellowish flashes somewhat golden The truth is that quite curious more things to take into account in the aesthetic section is a phone that has curves and I mean generally curves curve in the back curve in the front very subtle will not bother people who do not like much cur screens you are not going to have any kind of problem and there is also a slight curvature in the upper part and in the lower part it is true that the screen frames are very well miniaturized they are not symmetrical and in the corners we do find some Somewhat more prominent black frames in nothing to write home about, but keep that in mind we have a little hole on the screen on the left side of quite contained dimensions and in the back, especially highlighting this camera module, we have three cameras, we do not have a telephoto lens, we'll talk just because that we have a digital zoom and a curious arrangement of the sensors, I do n't dislike it and I will explain why because we are seeing that the current trend is to put camera sensors that are very reminiscent of other manufacturers. You will like it but it does not look like any of them. We have a double module in different combinations. It is a good hoop. They have been quite curious about it. we have usb type c we do not have a 3.5 jack we have the possibility of using two dwarfs without an important detail also with this positive one and we have a double speaker signed by the people of harman kardon or on the front but on the bottom and on the side top top where we also find the infrared sensor this the highlight of the emmy 11 seems to me a nice phone a premium phone when we have it in hand it feels very good and it is something to be thankful for and finally we do not have resistance to water from dust a of the few things that we can reproach them and in the security sections that I do not forget the fingerprint reader on the screen we have here the sensor thanks to the amoled screen it works very well very fast no problem and is accompanied by a facial recognition that also works in practically any condition but we go it works very well of I tell you either of the two security methods there are no surprises we are going to pass Now if you think in this analysis of the tsja or beyoncé talking about the hardware section historically or I have always done the same not at relatively low prices carlos the high-end of sao me is becoming more expensive it is true but they also give you of everything I want to say it is natural 888 and then we have memory configurations or 12 gb of ram ddr 5 and memories that go from 128 or 256 fs 3.1 so we have maximum speeds for the memories and we do not have expansion with liquid cooling microsd cards and now I want to talk about the performance before talking about the battery of the connectivity of other details lm and 11 is a shot and here there are no surprises I want to say you already know that the performance of the xiao me phones especially in the high ranges are out of all doubt more than anything because they have one of the most powerful processors on the market we will see what happens when we compare them with the following terminals but if you are looking for a phone to play a phone to squeeze you do not want frames to fall you want to go full blast because obviously this is one of the most related phones today, then many others will come with the same hardware but today the emmy 11 is one of the most similar phones powerful of the panorama very happy with the performance they are seeing the graphical tests with many games and very, very well let's talk about the battery we have 4600 milliamps and we are very satisfied with the battery before I told you something this is something very personal I with this phone reached the end of the day so I have been able to do almost 7 hours of screen that one over demanding is a nut in a user like us who have four instagram accounts four email accounts four twitter accounts receipts finds us valuable notifications I use myself for that It's hard for me to talk about screen hours because the use that I make of screen time I'm sorry, I don't think it's yours not for nothing but because igu When your game is more than me, I love the day with social networks , I am still recording all day, you are making history, it does not mean that the fact that the screen advisor to me scratches me a bit because it depends a lot on the user what yes that you must be calm that we are going to reach the end of the normal day without problems things to highlight we have to do 55 watts fast which is not bad we have a charger here in the office too much now explain this one hundred percent in 45 in Less than an hour and 50 minutes you are going to have it charged then we have to give the wire that at 50 watts very well I use a lot of wireless charging at home in the car I have with his jaume charger that we already made a video it goes to 20 watts but hey charge me and this water and then we have someone reversible wired everything that the problem is going to talk about the absence of the charger in this box obviously in the emmy 11 does not come the charger you already saw in china and this is a bitch because We are getting used to what the whole manufacturer will do to take care of neither the s-21 nor the iphone and all those who are yet to arrive are going to get on the bandwagon. What happens this phone has left it to the tech team people we already said in the box and thank you very much you can buy it on their website or we will leave a link in the description in china you can buy the phone in the middle 11 at least for now with or without charger at the same price that 95% of people have taken the phone with a charger so the excuse of the environment a bitch because in the end people at equal prices take it obviously not that it will happen in our country when it arrives officially we do not know it will sell a part who knows will lower the price sincerely I don't think so, I'm just telling you that the Yao website has a 65-watt charger that costs 30 bucks, this I don't want to say anything, that is, in the event that it is an 11 officially in our country, it comes without a charger, which is what I can Now imagine that alternative I do not know I tell you that the charger does not come I would like it to have it of course but we are going to have correct autonomy 55 watts of fast charge and now we do talk in this case the wifi connectivity 65 g and an nfc phone and dual sim we are going to talk about the very fast software section because in this case we have very 12 running above android 11 you already know a layer of personalization that we like very much we are very fans of demi it is an interesting face lift it feels very Well, the 120 hertz in the interface, the animations, the multitasking, we have a lot of customization, a section destined for games, I don't extend myself because we have a software channel that Miguel has, you know, and there we have a dedicated video. look at all the details of my wii 12 that you should know we have a software channel that is the right place for them to expand and know all the details but now that It is a historical layer, we are going to start now boys and girls with the multimedia sections because when we first made contact and I told you that we were liking this phone a lot, especially because the subject that we are going to deal with now is that of the screen, I think we have an exceptional screen 6 with 81 inches a huge screen amoled technology a lot of resolution we have w qhd 2 here we go 3200 x 1440 in a format 20 ninth 120 hertz refresh rate 480 hertz touch response and we find a brightness of 1500 nights or It is at the level of specifications that we are not very fans at the level of numbers, it is the [__] but then when you see it it is the [__] very good screen, one of the best screens on the market, one of the configurations that we will get used to because we are going to see in many flagship phones in many top-of-the-range phones it will have this new 2 every 120 hertz amoled very high brightness levels and it is one of those screens that seems to be suitable This above you do not see some planes that seem unreal even not because as it seems that it is set by software well the screen we love the viewing angles a very high level of brightness also hdr 10 a panel with 10 bits very well the truth is that it is also protected With gorilla glass we carry it in the case that comes in the box by the way we have not had any problem with scratches on the screen one of the most positive points of this phone that is very clear to you that it is very good in addition to the Resolution can be modified you can also change the refresh rate so that you know in relation to the issue of autonomy our tests have been at full speed of 120 hertz resolution 2 k and it has been efficient if you want to make sure you lower it to 1080 and you would not have more problems the screen very well next positive point and I say so let's report conclusions in the auditory section very well double speaker below and above signed by the people of harman kar Don with a lot of quality with a lot of volume a very resounding sound the sound of the emmy 10 was very good this one from lm ​​and 11 is also so, we are in luck and we leave you a clip the name asks taking for granted for a year we are going to continue And as you see the screen and audio section, we flip them to one of the most differential points of e-mail and we get to the back section, we turn it around and look at the back of this Chinese phone, we find three main cameras, one of them with An earring with a lot of predominance a 108 megapixel sensor that already or I had already been using a 13 megapixel wide angle and a smaller one that was the macro functions I repeat and as I said at the beginning this phone does not have a telephoto lens, it does have a digital zoom of which we will talk and I can imagine that this is what they save for the pro version that is not confirmed but obviously we all hope we will talk about the photographic result very quickly and be seen endo photographs in section one we have some very good photographs good color a good hdr we also have a quite natural interpretation of the scene we do not have fanfare despite letting artificial intelligence do its job we do not have very very saturated colors we do not have a very very image processed during the day I liked it now well and this sentence that I am going to say I think it is worth a bit to define the entire emmy 11 camera I think it is an 8 out of 10 camera I mean there are phones like the pixel like some generations of new phones like the iphone 12 in some situations it has like the may 40 pro that have a better camera than this medium now well this phone is also cheaper I think we have a camera that complies and drank very well we have a wide angle that is not bad at all anymore that correct there is not too much dispersion at night yes it is true that the quality dropped a little but it does not disappoint macro sensor I use it practically for nothing but Well, there are some photographs of some plants, the curious one we can bring it close enough to about four centimeters to be able to take the photograph and there are planes that are not bad and at night here if we want a correct result but yes that is where we find it to be a little step behind the super super super cameras of the super top 3 even so good conditions in practically any situation I can tell you a camera of 8 out of 10 anyone who buys the emmy 11 is not going to feel disappointed now, you tell me Carlos I want the best camera on the market I sincerely believe that there are some better ones, we talk about the zoom issue, we do not have an optical zoom, but the digital zoom with 2 is enough, what it can make use of, obviously, is the 108 megapixel sensor, it does not come activated by default It is a separate mode, you activate it if you want to have much more details we are going to follow some photographs we will make a crop in some photographs and see how it holds m uh well the ballots logically we do not have a resolution jet even if you want to make a club a cut out you will be able to do it to finish talking about photography also in portrait mode we have a very good portrait mode we have very good texture if we make a crop on the jacket a good interpretation of the skin shows us a lot of information in the beard, well because some Chinese phones that you already know that there are with the skin make the dick a bit a mess the cut is very good yes it is true that the blur is somewhat artificial se you can calibrate but I liked the portrait let's continue talking about the video section let's see what secrets and what is the performance that we have had with this phone on the one hand it supports recording 8 here at 30 frames supports 4k at 60 and then we have a lot of slow motion and a lot of frames recording also in hdr I really liked the same not serious the same with iphone it does not record the same as the last generations of samsung as the nou 20 another that records very well but the video is very good is super well stabilized good hdr we have a lot of modes dual video mode a clone mode a block mode to be able to put presets in good music they have worked it out at the software level The xiao camera interface to take advantage of it, I know that the video section I repeat the same is not the best but it is a very good video section and for people who are important as in my case it is very good. So we have recorded a small video for you so you can see how the microphones of the phone also behave, well, it is a recording test with the tsja omni my 11 to see how its rear camera behaves, recording 4k 8 each etc. etc. and also so you can see how the microphone behaves here in barcelona that it is cold [__] we got to continue with the front camera we have a single 20 megapixel front camera more than well yes it is true that we have We interpret a somewhat overexposed image a slightly more illuminated image although I believe that this is at absolute will that they raise the illumination of the photograph a little to have an image a little brighter you can modify it but you know it and it is not bad is the The end is more than correct and we also have a small vertical video recorded so that you can see how it records at high resolution and how it sounds good this is a test recording with the front camera of the new xiaomi m 11 we put ourselves against the light as you can see it holds very good if you continue to see my face in the correct way and still keep a little information from the window and also so that you can see how the microphone behaves more or less about 50 centimeters away, well guys, we are already finishing The analysis of lm and 11 as you can see we have talked about a lot of issues of the battery of the performance of the design of the security methods of the screen of the audio of the photography d The video shit me the milk a complete review but we know that it is an important phone and there were many things to tell in this case, let's talk about the price again thanks to the tech team for leaving us the device we will see what the official price is. The price that will not be far from the official 799 euros in the international version will arrive shortly the version, sorry, the Chinese version is in English shortly and the international version will arrive, which I think is the global one that will arrive in our country with Spain and demand we always see the Price no but 800 euros I think it will be the price and I think it is not bad we will see what happens in Spain with the issue of the charger understand that now we are a bit ambiguous when the information arrives we will leave it here below in the description but how we have received it as soon as we do not handle this information, we will talk a little at the end of the evaluations that I have with the medium 11 on a phone that I have loved and I will put the se River of recommended I already put it in front of the recommended man and now we will make a bit of an assessment is a super complete phone is a super balanced phone is not perfect and has details that I can imagine that in the pro version they will have the water resistance the Telephoto lenses are mainly the two absences that can be blamed on this medium 11 nevertheless for 800 euros I think it is reasonable because we have a nice phone we have a phone with one of the latest hardware with a decent battery we have an exceptional screen we have audio spectacular we have a camera of remarkable height we have a video that is also very complete it is almost perfect it lacks things there are phones where they improve some details but for 800 euros I think it is a more than recommended purchase and without a doubt a very good example in the high-end I already tell you, we will see what happens with the rest of the manufacturers, those phones that will presumably cost something more. What will happen with the version of the m-11 pro we will see if it is more worth one than the other leaving all that aside element 11 is a very good phone so nothing guys we hope from the heart that you have liked this video very much that you have found It is especially useful for us is the most important thing that here we try to solve some doubts and that when you want to change the phone you have as much information as possible because we are aware that there are more and more phones, more and more companies and it is a bit of a mess no so nothing a big hug see us here very soon then tomorrow's range a new video of course goodbye I love you family ah Hello guys, you are watching the camera comparison between the Xiaomi Mi 6 and the Huawei P10 Let's get started The Xiaomi Mi 6 is equipped with two 12MP sensors, an IMX386 with f/1.8 aperture, OIS 4-axis & an ISOCELL with f/2.6 aperture and ability to capture 4K video at 30fps and 720p at 120fps. While the Huawei P10 is equipped with Leica's second-generation dual camera, which consists of a 20MP monochrome and a 12MP RGB sensor with f/2.2 aperture, OIS and ability to capture 4K video at 30fps and 720p at 120fps. from the phone's screen i can see some issues with the auto focus on P10 the colors on the mi6 appear to be more flushed and more saturated and less natural on p10 the focus issue continues in p10 the colors are more intense, but right now the black in reality is not as deep as on p10 the mi6 colors are are closer to reality on the other hand the p10's colors are more pleasant to eyes let's try the autofocus to see how fast it be in the two devices from what i see is fast, you'll tell me for sure may i missing something the quality on both devices seems to be good, the dynamic range too for sure i can't judge right now from the screens of the phones this is your job i think it's the time to test the image stabilization we tried the ois so, enough with the video, let's move on, to some photo samples As you can see it's difficult to tell which device excels in good lighting conditions although the mi6 seems to have a little more noise and more natural colors, while p10 has more saturated colors although this is not necessarily bad, but is a matter of a personal taste In the 2x lossless zoom, the mi6 seems to do slightly better job While the bokeh effect is more natural to mi6 but on the other hand the p10 gives us more options on the effect, such as strength, but also the change of focal point after the taking of the photo Regarding the selfie camera, except the wider field of view, the difference is evident in favor of p10 As for the slow motion video, the differences between the devices are obvious as not only the quality of the video on P10 is much better, but it seems that mi6 doesn't record as many fps as it promised It's time to test the phones in low light conditions here, in theory the mi 6 has the advantage due to the bigger aperture at f/1.8 while the p10 at f/2.2 all that in theory of course but isn't the only parameter rom the screens of the devices i see that actually the mi6 has less noise and capture more details let's check again the auto focus it seems to be good in both devices although right now i see that mi6 struggles it have some issues i want to tell you that recently the p10 get an update who improved the camera performance i can confirm that is better than the time of the camera comparison with the S8 i have took some pics and in some photos in low light the p10 was better than S8 for sure i can't judge right now from the screens of the phones you'll do this job for me as regards the selfie, both devices equipped with 8MP sensor the p10 with f/1.9 and the mi6 with f/2.0 from the screens of the devices i see that that the colors in mi6 are more natural while in p10 are more yellowish I want you to tell me in the comment section which phone has the better selfie camera that's it for the selfie Let's look at some sample photos in low light conditions In low light conditions beyond the obvious that p10 has a tendency to yellowing the colors is difficult to say which of the two devices is superior since in some shots the mi6 excels, while in others the p10 excels Using the flash, things are clearer, as unlike p10, the colors on the mi6 appear to be flushed, which was not the case with mi5s and mi5s I had tried in the past. To summarize, we would say that in good lighting conditions the mi6 seems to have a bit more noise but more natural colors marginally better lossless zoom, more natural bokeh effect but without the options of p10. as well as better video quality due to the focusing problems facing the p10 in fast motion on the other hand the p10 has a clear superiority in selfies under all conditions and much better slow motion video quality. At low light conditions, is difficult to say which of the two devices is superior since in some shots it excels the mi6 while in others the p10 With the use of the flash, the p10 has a clear superiority with very vivid colors unlike mi6, which seems to be washed, something that don't happen with the previous company's flagships. What are your thoughts about the photographic performance of the two devices? Leave a comment with your opinion and of course if you liked my video please make a like, subscribe and click the notifications bell to never miss my new videos this is the new redmi note 10 pro from xiaomi and while we are only a few months into the year so far at least i think this is the best budget phone you can buy hey guys i'm tom of techchap and this will save you back just 279 when it launches in early april and for that you're getting a 120 hertz amoled screen a snapdragon 732g a big 5020 milliamp hour battery quad camera setup with a 108 megapixel main lens dual sim micro sd dual speakers even a headphone jack and an ir blaster so this is pretty jam packed with what you'd need but of course being a well mid-range phone we are missing a few bells and whistles that you get from higher end flagships such as there's no 5g or wi-fi six it has gorilla glass 5 rather than the latest victus fairly basic ip53 splash resistance although that's better than nothing and the snapdragon 732 g while more than capable is of course still a mid-range chip so yeah there's always room for improvement but keeping that price tag of 270 pounds in mind i don't think there's a better phone out there for that kind of money now it does kind of feel like xiaomi releases a new phone every five minutes it's kind of hard to keep up to be honest but the redmi note series has always been a highlight and now we have the note 10 pro this is actually quite a big upgrade over last year's note 9 pro lcd becomes amoled 60 hertz becomes 120 the snapdragon 720 g is now the 732 g and the 64 megapixel is now 108 and considering it's launching at the same price that's not bad at all and i also think it looks a lot more expensive than other phones at this price point for example the poco x3 is one of its closest rivals but i much prefer this more subtle styling so i do like the look of it if i can get that to focus in but firstly you can see it does pick up the odd smudge or fingerprint and also this onyx gray color well it's not the most exciting really i think i'd rather go for the glacier blue or the gradient bronze colors of this so on the front we're getting gorilla glass 5 with a plastic frame on the outside and a curved glass back on the right side we're getting a fingerprint reader built into the power button you also have the option for face unlocking but i still find this much more reliable than say a cheap optical in screen reader and it's just one press to power and unlock it as the youtuber cliche goes it does feel good in the hands but one of the highlights of the note 10 pro is this 6.67 inch screen it is full hd plus but unlike the note 9 pro it's 120 hertz and also amoled so we're getting much richer and inkier colors thanks to the higher contrast ratios along with much better viewing angles and actually diving deeper it turns out we're getting the same samsung made amoled panel that's used on the s21 and the xiaomi mi 11. so this is a very good screen i must admit though when i first unboxed and started testing this i didn't have the spec sheet with me so it was a pleasant surprise when i went exploring in the display settings to see this 120 hertz option although it doesn't appear we're getting any kind of adaptive or auto mode with the refresh rate so unlike higher end phones that can dynamically adjust the refresh rate to save battery here you pick 60 or 120. it makes such a big difference though especially combined with the 240hz touch sampling so whether you're gaming or just swiping around the menus and home screens because i know miui isn't everyone's favorite android skin but at 120 hertz it's much smoother and more responsive i really don't mind it and there's tons of options for customization but i think my only criticism would be that we're still getting lots of bloatware and pre-installed apps so there's actually three versions of this the entry level spec gets you six gigs of ram and 64 gigs of storage uh the mid tier one the one that i've got here uh also has 60 gigs of ram but 128 storage and then there's a top spec one which gets you eight gigs of ram but also 128 storage but don't forget we do have that micro sd card support so you can expand the storage on any of them so you could probably get away with going for the cheapest one now just a quick mention of the battery and it's actually the same 5020 million power battery as the note 9 pro albeit with air versus slightly faster 33 watt charging now i've only had a few days with the note 10 pro so i will need a bit more time to fully test the battery but so far i'm finding i have about 30 of my battery left by 11 pm of course the jump up to 120 hertz will have an impact on battery in the order of around 10 but then again we are getting a more efficient amoled screen along with a full hd resolution and a good size battery so the note 10 pro will easily get you through a full day and then some okay camera time and the 2020 trend of just chucking in macro and depth sensors to pad out the marketing so we can say it's got a quad camera set up is still going on but to my surprise they're actually pretty good i don't usually start off camera tests playing with a macro lens because well they're usually terrible but these 5 megapixel f 2.4 photos from the so called telemacro lens are actually surprisingly good plus in these couple of portrait mode shots you can see the edge detection and also that natural looking bokeh behind me it all looks quite good and it's presumably helped by that depth sensor a good start then but i think a proper telephoto lens would have been nice to see we're only getting a digital zoom here but the main and the ultra wide lenses are the most important and so far i like what i'm seeing so the main lens 108 megapixels although the nine into one pixel binning means we're actually ending up with 12 megapixel photos unless you switch to the full high resolution mode and importantly not only is this a higher resolution than the note 9 pro but we're also getting a new and crucially bigger sensor it's still not quite as good as the sensor used in the flagship mi 11 or upcoming mi 11 pro but that's to be expected given the price and with the f1 9 aperture photos are bright we're getting good dynamic range and close-up shots offer a really nice depth of field swiping over to the more tab and you'll see a whole bunch of different modes including night mode which i'd actually edit and put on the main carousel for quicker access xiaomi are calling it night mode 2.0 which uses and i quote advanced raw multi-frame algorithms so essentially multiple raw photos combined into one to give us brighter and sharper low light shots around the front we're getting a 16 megapixel camera although again that's pixel bin down to four megapixels with an f 2.45 aperture but photos portraits and even night mode selfies on the note 10 pro overall quality is very impressive cute or creepy what do you think so i'm shooting this at 4k30 i'm also using the microphones to well record my voice uh this is a little behind the scenes of my uh surprisingly small living room and uh desk office setup i try to cram in all my filming in this little space uh but this is being shot at 4k 30 and if i start walking you can really feel that jutter it's not the smoothest at 4k although in good light quality is actually really nice and also uh the focusing is pretty fast let's go from uh the flower to that uh british dog thing in the background whatever that is so let's switch to 1080p to see if the stabilization is any better okay same again now shooting at 1080p and even just looking at the screen as i'm filming this it looks a whole lot smoother than the 4k so i think most of the time you're probably going to want to stick with 1080p if you are walking or moving around so uh let's switch things around and now we're shooting this from the front facing selfie camera it tops out at 1080p there's no 4k selfie video option unfortunately let's go over to my desk where i'm transferring some files for actually editing this video i've just shot some b-roll uh i'm using premiere pro this is my desk setup which is a well crazy mess behind the scenes at the moment but yeah what do you think of the video also the microphones uh let me know in the comments below back to work so xiaomi's camera tech has well come a long way in the last couple of years of course this still won't compete with your galaxy s21s or your iphone 12s but for the price it's very impressive and the other nice thing is that not only are we getting a better camera than before but actually viewing your photos and videos back on this amoled screen is an even better experience downsides well phones like the poco x3 are very similar and actually about 50 pounds cheaper although you are missing out on that amoled screen also while the 732g chip is slightly faster than last year it's not a big upgrade it still doesn't support 5g so it would have been good to see something like the newer 750g which came out late last year and it's also a shame we don't have a proper telephoto camera lens but i think other than that there's not a whole lot to complain about so i think you can probably tell by now that yeah i really like this phone it does remain to be seen how the competition will stack up in this 300 price range because this is actually one of the first good budget phones to come out in 2021 so far but with some really significant upgrades over last year's model a fantastic screen a solid camera and also the same competitive price this is the budget phone to beat so far but what do you reckon would you be tempted to buy the note 10 pro or are you maybe going to hold out and see what other mid-range and affordable phones are coming out let me know what you think in the comments below and if you do want to check this out i will leave links in the description below and hopefully you enjoyed this video and if you do want to see more from me tap that subscribe button ding that bell all those annoying things and i will catch you next time right here on the tech chat cheers for [Music] watching [Music] to take [Music] you don't scare me don't trust the water [Music] you've been [Music] you don't scare me [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] so please check the numbers [Music] so [Music] you [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey what's up guys will here for gsm arena 5g connectivity at a low price that's something we're starting to see a lot of and the latest device with this sort of marketing is the poco m3 pro 5g this is a phone that might seem pretty familiar to some of you so let's see what it has to offer in our full review [Music] the poco m3 pro 5g is a new phone from xiaomi that's identical to another new phone from xiaomi can you guess which one if you said redmi note 10 5g then i'd be pretty surprised actually but kudos to you for being one of the special few that can keep track of xiaomi's convoluted project release and naming scheme the specs of these two phones are exactly the same the only major difference is the appearance both are made of plastic but the poco has a glossy finish that looks like glass and it also has that snazzy black accent around the black camera bump and if you're still confused at least it says poco right there in big letters it's worth noting that there's no ingress protection on either this device or the redmi and you can find that on some competitors even at this price the display of the poco m3 pro 5g is a 6.5 inch ips lcd with a 1080p resolution and is protected by gorilla glass 3. again no difference from the redmi as is the trend these days the display has a fast 90 hertz refresh rate which helps smooth out movement when you're swiping and scrolling this screen is quite decent for an lcd it's contrasty with impressively deep black levels and brightness is good we measured around 410 nits maximum with the slider which boosts up to around 530 nits in auto mode when in bright sun colors can be pretty accurate too if you tweak them in color settings there is no hdr10 support here though there's a single bottom firing loudspeaker for your audio and it scored a good mark on our loudness charts the sound quality here is good too for a budget phone with well-presented mids and highs but not much for bass [Music] you also get a headphone jack on the poco m3 pro 5g as well as fm radio support waking up and unlocking the phone can be done with the side mounted fingerprint scanner slash power button is super fast and responsive as you'd expect from xiaomi and you can opt for 64 or 128 gigs of storage on board which is expandable through microsd the interface of the poco m3 pro 5g is poco's version of miui 12 over android 11. the poco flavoring means that the system theme and icons are different by default and the app drawer is mandatory you can't disable it you do get the option to split the traditional notification shade into a notification center accessed from the top left corner and a control center which you'll enter by swiping the top right and since there is an ir blaster you can use the phone as a remote control for certain appliances just like the other budget 5g smartphones we've seen recently the poco m3 pro 5g runs on a mediatek demensity 700 chipset besides the connectivity it also provides acceptable performance for the class unfortunately benchmarks wouldn't run on a review unit just like we experienced with the redmi note 10 5g but the ui and apps run smoothly and although the gpu is a bit underpowered games run fine on lower graphics settings powering the phone is a large 5 000 milliamp hour battery and in our proprietary tests it was able to score a very good endurance rating of 121 hours the same as the redmi note 10 5g the poco comes with a 22.5 watt adapter but it only supports up to 18 watt charging we were able to charge the phone from zero to just 33 in half an hour the same as the redmi and not very fast now on to the poco m3 pro 5g's triple cameras there's a 48 megapixel quad bay or main cam a 2 megapixel macro cam and a depth sensor photos from the main cam come out at 12 megapixels and in good light they are excellent for this budget class they are rich in detail and nicely sharp with low noise mostly accurate colors and pretty good dynamic range the foliage rendition isn't great but we've seen worse from much more expensive phones portraits are taken with the help of the depth sensor and they have impressive subject separation and nice colors but for some reason these portraits aren't quite as sharp as the ones we got from the redmi note 10 5g 2 megapixel close-up shots from the pocos macro camera have lively colors and good contrast and the detail level is good enough for this resolution however since focus is fixed it can take several tries to get a photo to come out sharp photos taken at night with the main cam are again great for this budget class there's a lot of resolved detail the colors look saturated and stay true to life and the contrast is good too some detail gets smeared by the noise reduction though and you do see some blown highlights here and there night mode restores highlights and also brightens the entire picture but the processing is more aggressive and you end up with more softness and less fine detail you can take selfies with the 8 megapixel front facing cam and these are outstanding for this price range there's more than enough detail superb contrast and low noise the poco m3 pro 5g can shoot video with the main cam and up to 1080p resolution at 30fps there's no 4k recording here the footage has great colors good contrast and likable dynamic range the level of detail is ok for 1080p footage on a budget and there's support for stabilization too so that's the poco m3 pro 5g 5g connectivity on a budget is the name of the game you also get a contrasty high refresh rate lcd good battery life nice speaker quality and a dependable camera both in the daytime and at night if you've already seen our review of the redmi note 10 pro 5g you may have experienced some deja vu here but you do get a different design and in some markets the poco is a little cheaper than the redmi so that's something of course you should also keep in mind that if you're not especially after 5g then you can find nicer features at this price in a 4g device thanks for watching guys stay safe and see you on the next one

latest smartphones let's talk about exactly what you need and more introducing our latest x series the poco x3 pro now the key word for this smartphone is more we're going to talk about some of the upgrades it's gotten over its previous generation the poco x3 nfc first we have more performance now last year with the poco x3 nfc we global debuted the 732g a great mid-range chipset but some fans may think x-series is a mid-range segment we will most likely launch a better 700 series offering a better mid-range performance but actually for the pro we're going to take it up one notch offering flagship performance for the poco x3 pro we'll be releasing the leading 4g processor in 2021. the qualcomm snapdragon 860 the x3 pro is actually the very first model to use this processor and the snapdragon 860 maybe one the last 4g flagship chipset for a while as an 800 series processor it uses a flagship structure and only a seven nanometer process and this prime core has a pretty high 2.96 gigahertz speed offering a ton of power so when we compare the snapdragon 860 to last year's flagship a65 there are a lot of similarities the 800 series structure with one prime core three performance cores and four efficiency cores now 700 series usually do two performance cores and six efficiency cores it's lacking that big prime core it's also a octa-core cpu with seven nanometer process and the gpu is also adreno 600 series actually let's talk about the gpu the snapdragon 860 comes with the qualcomm adreno 640 offering smooth gaming and we did an fps test on this with one of the most popular games in the industry the gentian impact the result was quite amazing using the snapdragon 860 we were able to get a stable 50 frames per second on average and the settings were on high i can confidently say in the 4g processor segment there isn't many chipset that can perform this well but besides gpu the 860 have a great ai engine as well up to 7.6 trillion operations per second also won the highest in the 4g segment which allows photo editing and video editing faster and quicker the combination of a great cpu gpu and ai the x3 pro's snapdragon 860 gored a very high antutu benchmark of around 490 thousand among the 4g chipsets this is definitely one of the best scores if not the best to give you an idea of why this is impressive let's take a look at a few comparisons now if we take one of the most commonly used 4g processor in the market in the last year or two and compare the snapdragon 720 g has an average antutu score of almost 280 000 but that is 76 percent in difference compared to the a60 the performance difference is massive but not only that let's compare with another 700 series the snapdragon 765g which is a 5g chipset is one of the best processors in 700 series regardless if it was 5g or 4g but the difference here is still very obvious 52 better performance with the 860. now i know some fans across the stream may be wondering how come we're comparing against 700 series 700 series is a standard for mid-range smartphones on the market at poco we're raising that standard and showing our fans it's most certainly possible to put an 800 series in the mid-range segment so simple poco x3 pro offers flagship 4g performance but processor isn't the only part we made a change we've also added ufs 3.1 which is a standard in high-end flagships these days but still pretty rare in the mid-range segment having ufs 3.1 you can get write speed up to 198 percent faster than 2.1 it's the perfect combination with the a60 and for our ufs 3.1 you can now get up to 256 gigabyte of internal storage compared to last year's poco x3 nfc it's an upgrade from 128 gigabytes but we also have a shocking expandable storage up to 1 tb that's amazing you could potentially have almost 1.3 terabyte of storage space on the poco x3 pro now just think about that for a second that's more storage space than most standard laptops of course we didn't forget to upgrade our ram as well from a 6 gig option only for the poco x3 nfc we're giving more ram in the x3 pro up to 8 gigs of ram flagship level so actually we didn't just upgrade the 4g performance we did the whole package offering a complete flagship performance the snapdragon 860 the leading 4g processor up to 8 gigs of ram flagship level and ufs 3.1 up to 256 gigs and still kept expandable storage and pushed that to one terabyte all of these performance providing more speed and power for your daily usage now powering all this performance we still have a huge battery of 5160 milliamp offering easily two days battery i remember seeing a lot of great comments about how good the poco x3 nfc battery is and many people claiming this is one of the best battery phone out in the market and even with the 800 series processor we're still getting great single usage time 11 hours of gaming 117 hours of music 18 hours of video playback and almost six and a half hours of 1080p video recording and when you do need to charge it it really doesn't take long even for a big battery like this without mmt 33 watt fast charging the poco x3 pro can reach a hundred percent in just 59 minutes and i used to be the type person that likes to leave my phone charging overnight but now the battery can easily last over for two days i usually charge it in the morning when i wake up and i get ready for work by the time i leave it's all juiced up super convenient so poco x3 pro more performance with flagship 4g processor flagship 8 gigs ram option flagship ufs 3.1 storage up to 256 gigabyte that awesome 5 160 milliamp battery with 33 watt fast charging and of course we did keep the liquid cool technology 1.0 plus for sustainable performance this is exactly the performance you need and more now thanks to the performance upgrade the poco x3 pro can get even more creative than before using the 860 with the ai performance boost more software features are made available let's take a look at the x3 pro's camera now the x3 pro still features a quad camera setup a 48 megapixel main camera using the sony imx 582 a 119 degree ultrawide camera a macro camera and a depth sensor let's check out some sample shots first we have the main camera shot we took a part of a bike and shot the gear setup as you can see the focus and the coloring on the gear is on point how different the lighting in the background gives it the shade on the metal finish but actually if we go closer we could see something even cooler in detail when you turn on your macro camera and shoot closer you can actually see the water droplets on the gear super small details can be seen with macro mode then when you take a portrait shot with a depth sensor with this mode you can see how captured with great details and blurring out the background only focusing on the model and this mode is very easy to use and of course the 119 ultra wide angle camera which is great for architecture shots like this you can see how even the wide angle you can still maintain the brightness contrast on this specific shot but because we have the snapdragon 860 ai capabilities we can capture not just during the day but also at night in this photo with ultra night mode turned on when you're in a dark environment with some lights in the background it actually boosts the brightness contrast while maintaining the colors now this mode is honestly great when you're trying to take a nice scenery shot of cities as well but most importantly we do have the video features that's powered by the snapdragon 860 specifically video clones and dual video let's check out both video out right now [Music] so [Music] that was some awesome videos and to support our dual video we actually have a 20 megapixel in display front camera which we also added a new feature night mode selfie now i don't usually take selfies myself but when i do i often find myself usually taking it in a pretty dark environment whether it's restaurants or outside the street lights this specific mode helps increase the contrast while keeping the clarity this is poco x3 pro's camera with more software features powered by the snapdragon 860 and maintaining a quad camera setup from last generation you'll get a lot of versatile content to play around with and rule over the social media space make sure you go explore other amazing features in the x3 pro there are a lot of them to play around with and now for design we've also changed a little bit on the x3 pro the poco x3 nfc was a unique looking device but we want to make it even cooler than before first we still kept the poco reflective chroma design that still stand out and still looks very cool and we kept it symmetrical as well we called it the finish line design before but it wasn't perfect we actually saw some complaints about the back design such as a lot of fingerprints when fans aren't using the case for the pro we've made a change we've used a dual texture in the back so on the sides of the x3 pro it has a matte finish so it can prevent fingerprints but besides making these small details we've also added three new colors we have the phantom black the frost blue and the metal bronze all three colors are brand new and refined a more complicated coloring process than before my favorite is actually the phantom black it has a touch of purple under to it under the light but the blue and metal bronze is pretty awesome looking too it's very eye-catching let us know which color you like most in the comments now we talked about the back design let's actually briefly take a look at the front display for our x3 pro's display we kept the 6.67 inch dot display keeping it super immersive we still have that tiny tiny dot at the top same size as previous generation and it's still a flagship level display that features 120 hertz refresh rate and 240hz touch sampling rate still great for gaming and daily usage whether when you're scrolling through instagram or twitter and the x3 pro also kept dynamic switch an awesome smart tech that helps save battery by automatically adjusting each content you view to its most optimized frame rate i personally thought this was one of the smartest feature on the x3 nfc and the x3 pro had to have it overall the x3 pro still has an amazing screen but yet we still took it to the next level on the x3 pro we added cording gorilla glass 6 giving flagship level display protection for those who don't know how good corning gorilla glass 6 is it's the level between corning gorilla glass 5 and the latest victus to give you a better idea corning gorilla glass 6 is a true flagship feature phones that are priced above a thousand usd has it and so does the x3 pro impressive right so to sum it all up on the x3 pro's design we have three new colors phantom black frost blue and metal bronze all three looks really good anti-fingerprint size to keep it more clean a massive 6.67 inch dot display that still maintained 120 hertz refresh rate and 240 hertz to sampling rate all that protected by corning gorilla glass 6 in the front this is exactly the design and display you need and more so we've upgraded poco x3 pro to not only offer exactly what you need but we gave you more performance more creativity and more design but we did keep some other great features from the x3 nfc that's still worth mentioning the dual speaker setup with the x3 pro you're still getting a great audio no matter what you're doing gaming or watching videos or listening to music and i say it's a great audio with confidence because we actually got tested by dxomark audio for our x3 nfc speakers which is the same as the x3 pro we were able to get a dxo mark audio score of 63. now that may not seem super impressive just by itself but what about this let's take a look at one of the flagships from last year that was also tested for dxo mark audio the samsung galaxy note 20 ultra 5g scored 68. just a little bit above poco x3 and fc but look at the price difference it's fair to say we're pretty much on the same level as flagships and when it comes to touch we still have a great z-axis linear motor it's super responsive when you're gaming and giving you the ultimate view experience and this feature is still uncommon to see in the mid-range smartphone range and lastly the essential features ir blaster nfc and headphone jack features that we believe are still very much needed based on the demands we see from users poco x3 pro has it all so we kept some great features from the poco x3 nfc big battery of 5160 milliamp and 33 watt fast charge 120 hertz refresh rate and 240hz touch sampling rate on a 6.67 inch dot display the dual speakers the z-axis linear motor nfc ir blaster and headphone jack the features we had and exactly what you need and when it comes to more we gave you a 800 series processor the 860 leading 4g processor up to 8 gigabyte of ram up to 256 internal storage of ufs 3.1 and corning gorilla glass 6 and a quad camera with more software features this is exactly what you need and more now price i believe today we won't disappoint our fans at all we will be offering a great price but first let's do a comparison if we take a look at some of the popular mid-rangers in the market in 2020 until now we've highlighted our strong points flagship 860 processor big screen with high refresh rate and touch sampling rate huge battery with 33 hour fast charge now their price is roughly starting at 450 euros and more but let's just not compare to others there is an old saying that it only matters when you've outdone yourself so let's take a look at a comparison with the poco x3 nfc with the massive processor upgrade ran upgrade and storage speed upgrade and maintaining all the beloved features from the x3 nfc our six gigabyte plus 128 gigabyte option that time for x3 nfc had a retail price of 269 euros and we did do an early bird of 249 euros which at the time i believe shocked many fans i was shocked myself but for the x3 pro for our base variant of 6 gigabyte and 128 gigabyte we do have an amazing price it starts at 249 euros now i'm curious how many fans across the stream their jaws dropped or maybe even said how is that even possible but we still have an early bird price to show you for the base variant we have an early bird price of 229 euros now we did put a question mark here actually but remember when we had a shocking achievement that kevin mentioned a 4 million poco x3 nfc shipped in just seven months we want to use this time to thank our fans so we tweaked the early bird price a little we actually have a early bird pricing on the base variant for 199 euros now i'm confident many fans are commenting like crazy right now because i was hyped when i first heard this we were able to do this but what made me even more shocked was when i looked back at this if we take a look at this chart look at the upgrades then the retail price and the early bird compared to the x3 nfc can you see how amazing and crazy this pricing is if we break it down our retail price for the pro is 20 euros less than the x3 nfc and 50 euros less in early bird it's amazing and simply shocking but we wanted to do it for our fans as a thank you for supporting us all this time especially in our x series now for a higher variant of eight gigabyte plus 256 gigabyte we also have an amazing price that starts at 299 euros now this is truly great value of course for our high variant we do have an early bird pricing it starts at 279 euros now you see the question mark again because we would like to play fair here at poco we wouldn't just do it for the base variant and not for the high variant for the high variant we actually have a early bird price of 249 euros now with this pricing i'm going to make a stronger statement here this makes poco x3 pro one the most affordable 4g flagship on the market and one of the best value smartphone as well and when you look at this chart again see our early bird pricing or even the retail pricing we beat our competitors in most of the features and at our base variant we're more than half the price on discount this is how we do it at poco now to get this crazy price phone the x3 pro it will be available from march 24th to april 1st on early bird pricing specifically for these channels our new official poco website will be one of the first channels you can check out so make sure you mark your calendars don't miss out on this deal i hope all the fans will be adding this to the cart on this date now we'll also be coming soon on a lot more platforms so please follow our official accounts in your regions to stay up to date on when it will be available and we also got one more thing we will also be offering a free of charge one screen replacement within six months of purchase please check your local region and terms of conditions for more information so here it is in summary the poco x3 pro starting at 199 euros for early bird and 249 euros on a higher variant for early bird as well flagship 4g performance with awesome features and a crazy price this is exactly what you need and more now i know these questions are happening right now in the stream and has been happening over social media as well at poco we hear our fans and i can say it's here we understand how important f series is for our fans f series started the journey the series that caught the eyes and attention of fans and media in the industry disrupted the market and established what we're doing here at poco is very important today we will be launching the latest f-series the long-awaited poco f3 and the team came up with one term to really describe what the poco f3 is the real beast now let's get started let's talk about this real beast i know our fans can't wait performance the one spec i know our fans want to hear first and may be most important for f series for the f3 we have put in immense amount of consideration of which processors should we use and there was one choice that was perfect the snapdragon 870 won the latest qualcomm 800 series chipset in short i can tell you the snapdragon 870 offers b speed it's very fast and it's very capable now let me explain some of the details of this specific chipset and what makes it special first the snapdragon 870 uses an octa-core structure with three different type of cores a similar structure as last year's chipset the snapdragon 865 we have one prime core three performance cores and four efficiency cores a flagship structure and of course we're also seven nanometer process making this a70 very power efficient tiny but it's mighty but special i said special earlier and what does 870 do that is special for our fans and that is it's prime core this qualcomm snapdragon 870 have a leading prime core speed of 3.2 gigahertz if you take a look at other flagship phones with other flagship processors in this market the 870 takes the number one spot but what does prime core speed actually do for our users if you compare it to a65 again the a7d has improved by 12 in the single core cpu performance processing any apps with ease and offering true b speed and when it comes to gaming the gpu structure is using the adreno 650 by using this structure and paired with our prime core the gpu experience has also improved more than 10 percent improvement compared to the 865. now for some of you this may seem like a small number but i've used the poco f2 pro which features the a65 all year last year and i did some heavy gaming on it and my settings were always on high or max graphics and that handled it with ease to think that there isn't further improvement on this it's pretty wild but we also did a gaming test with one of the most popular games in the industry right now gentian impact and the result was amazing we ran the poco f3 on high settings with 60 fps max and played for one hour straight with the f3 you can get an average of 58 frame rate per second that's beast gaming to support that we needed to keep the beast cool we added liquid cool technology 1.0 plus which really helps with long period of heavy load usage time keeping the processor cooler allowing it to run longer and smoother but not only the pro performance the snapdragon 870 is great at when it comes to ai processing the f3 can reach up to 15 trillion operations per second and that's one of the best performance ai processing from a flagship chipset taking photos and videos with ease and making your overall experience just so much smoother and when you add cpu gpu nai the question of poco f3's antutu score it actually scored a very high score of 640 000 a true flagship level antutu a real beast comparing to last year's snapdragon 865 score that we got in the poco f2 pro as quite the improvement almost 60 000 points in difference to sum it all up it's simple the snapdragon 870 in the poco f3 is one of the best processors in the industry right now offering b speed to pair with that with such an awesome processor we had to also match up ram and rom technology up to 256 gigabytes of ufs 3.1 and up to 8 gigabyte of ram from lpddr5 offering beast ram and rom options and when it comes to connectivity the poco f3 is also 5g ready up to 23 times faster speed compared to 4g and it's also compatible with 11 different network bands the f3 also supports y56 which is 2.7 times faster than wi-fi five so when you're home or at the office your connection is super fast and more stable no lag during gaming no more time wasted on buffering videos be speed only now this is poco f3 the real beast performance snapdragon 870 which features a 3.2 gigahertz prime core speed one the best processor in the industry flagship ram and ram 5g and wi-fi six ready now we talked about how beast the poco f3's performance is i think many people may be asking what about display and i can tell you with all the confidence in the world we have a real beast display fans watching the stream you won't be disappointed what we had to make sure first is the screen's gotta be big a b screen size 6.67 inch comfortable for daily viewing and any sort of gaming or content watching then we decide to go with a flat screen now some of the poco fans know i'm a gamer and as a gamer i actually can't stand miss touches with the flash screen the chances of mid touches and edge is close to none and to guarantee a full screen experience we decided to go with a dot display it was a decision made by how many fans appreciated and really enjoyed the viewing experience from our x3 nfc well for the poco f3 we actually did a little minor change and took it to the next level the f3 has a 2.76 millimeter dot display that's super small and if we compare and take samsung galaxy s21s dot display for example it has a size of 3.61 millimeter our 2.76 millimeter tiny dot is an industry leading tiny dot making sure it's as immersive as it gets now we talked about how big and immersive the screen is but our screen is also amoled not just any amoled and i know this was an ask by fans on twitter and has been all over the media in the last few months and almost a year but our amoled is an e4 amoled flagship level one of the best screens out there to give some fans who don't know what e4 amoled is let me break it down for you it has a peak brightness of 1300 nits a contrast ratio of 5 million to 1 and the high brightness level is actually at 900 so the colors will be bright and vibrant even under the sun and compared to last generation's amoled material e3 e4 actually uses 15 percent less power which helps conserve battery in general a true beast display now this beast display also supports true color which is the tuning of the color of your content to the most realistic accuracy a must-have feature especially when you're watching a lot of content for me personally i love documentaries like planet earth and i've watched planet earth on this screen and it brings everything to life but as a flagship display it must also have hdr 10 plus giving our users crystal clear clarity for all their content let's take a look at the effect if you look at the comparison you can see that with hdr 10 plus the video quality is even more vibrant and clear it optimizes each frame to as best brightness possible even the parts of the video where it's dark now we also have memc this is an awesome feature let's check it out what memc does is intelligently analyze the video as you watch creates additional frames to give you a smooth clear video better than you would have had without it's amazing and on top of all the great features we have we also have a 360 degree light sensor it can detect the lighting environment around you and adjust the brightness accordingly actually we also have true display function this is to protect your eye sights and making sure when staring at your screen during different environments we have true display technology to ensure not just the brightness we're adjusting but also the color warmth on your screen when i use my phone all day and all night which i do a lot i really appreciate this feature it's a lot less stress on my eyes so with all these features the poco f3 display is not actually only just flagship level it's really one of the best displays out there in the industry with a 6.67 inch flat display featuring a 2.76 millimeter tiny dot an e4 amoled that supports all the optimizing features this is f3's real beast display well now we've actually got to talk about the gaming the real beast gaming experience having that awesome 870 processor a wildly good screen is going to be quite the combo for our gamers out there but we've got more optimizations for you first our screen is 120 hertz refresh rate on top of the e4 amoled we just talked about 120 hertz plus e4 amoled crazy good but 120 hertz is actually getting a bit more common in the flagship segment let's take it up a notch touch sampling rate the poco f3 features a super high touch sampling rate of 360 hertz absolute beast now 360 hertz is one of the industry's highest touch sampling rate available and it's a crucial feature for the gamers out there with this you can stay one step ahead among your enemies or with your friends to give you a reference of how good 360 hertz is we can simplify it like this 120 to 180 hertz touch sampling rate are usually found in the average entry to mid-range smartphones hitting 240 hertz there are some flagships and performance phones out there using it but 300 plus you're reaching a whole new level now let's take a look at a comparison against one of the flagship devices on the market samsung s21 which features a 240 hertz touch sampling rate and for our beast gamers out there we also have game turbo 4.0 on the f3 which has an awesome advanced gpu tuner that allows you to tweak your in-game settings in one place so it makes adjusting graphics settings much easier to take it up on a hardware level we also have a dual speaker setup on the poco f3 an essential for gaming and for daily usage in general honestly i've used a single speaker phone for a while and when you're wielding it horizontally you sometimes block the speakers on one side and the sound is just gone it's very irritating but with dual speakers you're getting a louder audio and it's less likely for you to block both speakers but this dual speaker is special it's got dolby atmos to make the sound even better making your audio experience better than you expect fully optimizing the serial sound from the dual speakers now we have a video from adobe atmos and let's take a look everyone my name is mahesh balakrishnan and i lead dolby's audio business globally we at dolby are looking forward to the launch of the poco f3 because not only are we thrilled to extend the extraordinary dolby atmos experience to smartphones from poco but we're also proud of the spectacular work done by poco in enabling a world-class entertainment experience on the f3 with dolby atmos available in the poco f3 consumers can access a robust library of movies and tv shows in the dolby atmos format from the most popular media streaming applications and expect incredible audio quality with unparalleled detail depth and realism no matter if you're listening through headphones or built-in speakers sounds will flow all around you in a life-like soundscape as you enjoy your favorite movies tv shows music and games in dolby atmos it really allows you to experience the finer details that the content creators wanted you to hear and with our intelligibility features your audio experience is elevated further with greater clarity even in noisy environments allowing you to stay engaged in your favorite content on behalf of dolby i wish poco a successful launch of the poco f3 and look forward to continuing to work with poco and bring groundbreaking experiences to more consumers thank you pretty amazing right but actually we have more other than adobe atmos we also have hi-res audio and hi-res audio wireless that works in harmony without dual speakers this is a real beast audio experience and lastly we can't forget the feel of the phone this is a huge part for the overall experience when how you feels when you click each button for a lot of influencers out there and tech enthusiasts this is one of the feature that can immediately identify a good phone and an average phone by using the x-axis linear motor you're getting a crisp feedback from every touch to sum up f3's beast gaming performance at the core we have the snapdragon 870 120 hertz refresh rate flagship 300hz touch sampling rate simply groundbreaking game turbo 4.0 that helps you optimize graphics with ease dual speakers that is working alongside with dolby atmos and high-res audio x-axis linear motor a flagship feedback hardware that makes the whole experience just so complete this is poco f3's beast gaming experience now we talked about how fast the f3 is how powerful how smooth but how beautiful because the real beast design i can tell you for certain there is beauty in this beast let's take a quick peek at the video so let's start off these two classy colors at first when you put them together simply elegant but let's introduce the f3 in knight black now being the real beast it is this elegant black is so stealth it's as if it's ready to hunt during the night absolutely gorgeous then we have the f3 in arctic white in a matte finish imagine this it was a beast running across a snow plane now personally i've always been a fan of darker color phone but this white really stands out and it's really special but we do have another color a different type of beast unleash the kraken now when we first came up with this color design we imagined it as it was a beast from the ocean let's take a look this is the f3 in deep ocean blue the great blue beast now this blue man oh man we pushed our id design to the limit because it's not just one blue it's three different blue all together with different tone and design i honestly think this is one of the coolest design phone i've seen for all these three colors we have arctic white night black and deep ocean blue arctic white is super elegant knight black simply stealth and deep ocean blue just very different let us know in the comments below in the stream which one is one of your favorites if you asked to ask me to choose one i'm having trouble choosing between arctic white and deep ocean blue but besides but making this beast beautiful we also considered how it feels how it weighs the f3 is super thin only at 7.8 millimeter making it our thinnest poco smartphone yet and it weighs only 196 grams so the overall feel of this device it's very light and comfortable to hold but what actually makes this even more impressive we managed to put in a huge battery of 4520 milliamp in the f3 which can last for two days on a single charge remember considering the fact that we have a 870 a 120 hertz amoled and a thin design and now a big battery to support it that's impressive right this beast is thin yet powerful 7.8 millimeter thin with a big battery of 4520 milliamp there's only very few devices on the market that is this thin with a battery this size beastly designed and built and on a single charge you can get up to 10 hours of gaming 14 hours of video playback and 149 hours of music and 23 hours of phone call and at one point when you do need to charge up we have the 33 watt fast charging which only takes 52 minutes to charge to 100 that's less than an hour and you're good to go of course we do include a 33 watt inbox charger as well but on the side of the phone we have actually further refined our side fingerprint sensor we flattened the usual fingerprint design and made this more seamless made it more elegant and clean to sum it all up we've got three beastly colors arctic white night black and a deep ocean blue honestly any of these three colors match any style only 3.8 millimeter thin and 196 grams paired with a huge battery of 4520 milliamp that supports 33 watt fast charging very few in the market and we also actually have corning gorilla glass 5 to make sure the f3 has a sturdy build all around a new refined side fingerprint sensor this is poco f3's real beast design and let's go on through camera for the f3 we have a triple camera setup a 48 megapixel main camera a 119 degree ultra wide and a tele macro camera that has auto focus between the distance of three centimeters to seven centimeters really allowing you to capture close and clear let's see through the eyes of the beast and see some sample shots when you use the f3 main camera you can get really detailed shots like this now if you take a look at this picture closely first you will see how detailed the architecture is but it also captured the light reflection of the metal perfectly as our model is holding the light sticks on the right side you can see the ratio of light bounced off the metal on the right is brighter than the left the details here are sharp then we also have night mode with ignite for the main camera with the lights around a model turning on night mode giving more contrast accuracy on the photo and overall this photo is just a very cool shot and when it comes to ultra wide which allows you to capture a lot more 119 degree more when you're at a distance and trying to capture something very large turn on that ultra wide to capture the full picture and now my favorite telemacro shot now at first you may think this is a

great mid-range chipset for the poco x3 pro we'll be releasing the leading 4g processor in 2021. the qualcomm snapdragon 860 as an 800 series processor it uses a flagship structure and only a 7 nanometer process and this prime core has a pretty high 2.96 gigahertz speed offering a ton of power the snapdragons 860 comes with the qualcomm adreno 640 go to very high antutu benchmark of around 490 thousand among the 4g chipsets this is definitely one of the best scores if not the best ufs 3.1 which is a standard in high-end flagships these days but still pretty rare in the mid-range segment

refresh rate and 240hz touch sampling rate on the x3 pro we added cording gorilla glass 6 giving flagship level display protection so to sum it all up on the x3 pro design we have three new colors phantom black frost blue and metal bronze all three looks really good anti-fingerprint size to keep it more clean a massive 6.67 inch dot display that still maintained 120 hertz refresh rate and 240 hertz to sampling rate all that protected by corning gorilla glass 6 in the front this is exactly the design and display you need and more so we kept some great features from the poco x3 nfc big

ponch we'll cut out cameras in the top left of the display on the back there's a camera bumped in the top-left corner these phones have a six point six seven inch OLED screen with HD at ten plus support and a screen refresh rate of ninety Haj to make content and motion lukovitch smoother the Shah we meet in and meet and probe both ran on the top and Snapdragon eight six five chipset we are with 12 GB of RAM and 512 GB of storage options that chipset has an adjacent 5g modem one of the most important feature of the Shamim Eaton Pro is the 108 megapixel main camera which take fantastic pictures and supports 8k video recording like the samsung galaxy s 20 series the shower v10 pro has a 20 megapixel ultra wide camera and two telephoto lenses one of these is 8 megapixel and supports

charging 30 watt wireless charging and 10 what reverse wall is charging which lets you use the device as a wireless power mat for other devices xiaomi has a reputation for producing quality phones at affordable prices and Shamim eaton pro 5 g is another example of that the me not turn pro brings all the features of the top-end phone but without the top-end price tag it's got a beautiful curved HD screen with a six point four seven inch Super AMOLED display that colors really pop max brightness is pretty high images loop textured and contrast is good at the top of the screen there is a small teardrop notch in the center which houses the front-facing camera there's a Snapdragon seven-30 G chipset here paired with 8gb of RAM which is a decent mid-range processor that's optimized for gaming the headline feature of the Xiaomi me notan pro is its camera the 108 megapixel main sensor is the first of its kind on a smartphone in the world and it's such an important part of the phone's identity and Sharma's marketing strategy there are five lenses on the back of the main camera is 108 megapixel an optical image stabilizer for the main lens is on board as is a flash the main rear camera is joined by a 12 megapixel sensor with 2x telephoto lens for the portrait mode as ii telephoto sniper this one with 5x zoom and 5 megapixel sensor for zoom shot another 20 megapixel ultra wide camera and finally a 2 megapixel macro snapper the main 108 megapixel camera takes absolutely incredible shots forget the iPhone 11 Pro Huawei P 30 or even real me X 2 pro this phone takes some of the best-looking pictures you will get from a smart phone everything here is on point colors are rich contrast is great and images are bright also you can report 4k video at 30fps on the front the Xiaomi me notan pro has a 32 megapixel camera housed in the teardrop notch and it comes with various filters and features selfies looked pretty vibrant and high-quality the Xiaomi me notan pro's battery capacity is five thousand two hundred and sixty milli ampere which is a lot bigger than what you get in most modern smartphones it also supports 30 watt fast charging the Xiaomi me Norton Pro is a powerhouse in so many ways and we can definitely recommend buying this phone Shami me 9 Pro 5g smartphone was released in September 2019 the phone comes with a six point three nine inch Super AMOLED touchscreen display with an aspect ratio of nineteen point five by nine it is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass six this device is powered by qualcomm snapdragon 805 plus seven nanometer processor it

thousand milliamp hour battery with 40 watt fast birthday charging support and 30 watt fast wireless charging support it was released in dream white and titanium black colors [Music] Shami meetin seemed to fit all the criteria of a premium flagship the display could impress many people this phone have a six point six of an inch OLED touchscreen with HD a ten plus support and a screen refresh rate of 90 Hertz to make content and motion look a bit a smoother screen cares' at the ages and there is also a punch from cutout camera in the top left of the display the Sharma me Jenny used the top and Snapdragon 8612 chipset coupled with 1gb of RAM and 256 GB of storage that chips that has an adjacent fargy model one of the most important features of the xiaomi meetin is the one hundred and eight megapixel main camera which takes fantastic picture and supports 8k video recording like the Samsung Galaxy s3 t-series there's also a 13 megapixel ultra wide camera our 2 megapixel macro snapper and a 2 megapixel depth sensor all of this different lens work is smoothly and delivers a stunning picture quality when capturing steel images target exposure is stable and accurate further Xiaomi has equaled the dynamic range over the last year's phone's retailer 20 megapixel front-facing camera which is a pretty decent resolution for the selfie snapper picture cell good enough for the price range in terms of battery the Xiaomi Wetton actually has the larger power packed on the May 10th row with the 4007 battery capacity so the meetin will likely last a bit longer it has 30 watt fast charging underwater wireless charging and a more diverse one is charging which lets me use the device and the wireless power map for other devices [Music] you so xiaomi is about to turn the cards xiaomi is doing what even samsung oneplus and apple cannot do right now see latest news from china say xiaomi mi 12 is now in the designing and development phase the me 12 is going to look like this this concept is made by chinese blogger who have seen the real design so yeah you can see a full screen display with no notch no hole we have a cord curved screen which looks fantastic like the me 11. now exciting part is xiaomi may use 4th gen in display camera design in the mid 12. we have seen the 3rd gen designer looks like a finished product but with the 4th and 5th gen design they'll fix all these issues and of course make selfie shooter take some great images some information from news drivers say xiaomi will use 1 hertz to 120 hertz variable ltpo display in the mi 12 something which the oneplus 9 pro features the me 11 series right now is stuck at 120 hertz that drains battery in favor of fluid experience so a mi 12 will use better and more power efficient ltpo display technology in this schematics you can see the mi12 might have a camera setup similar to the mi 11 pro and of course with some new sensors and changes now xiaomi recently showcased 200 watts of fast charging which can fully charge a smartphone in 8 freaking minutes xiaomi says it's not that bad for battery health it is however going to degrade 20 battery in 800 cycle count that is fine in my opinion xiaomi use 120 watts fast charging in the meat and ultra and some rumors are they may likely debut the 200 watts super fast charging in me 12 ultra sweat these are some insane level specifications and design not to mention xiaomi will be using qualcomm's 898 or 895 flagship cpu which is based on 4 nanometer fabrication process and we have adreno 730 gpu in there that is a massive performance boost so you can see xiaomi is about to do what no one else can do samsung s22 oneplus 10 and iphone 13 of course are coming with same control and notch display the mi 12 ultra however will be a different product which is going to take a step forward into the future some good news for those who cannot wait to see the me 12 like design in action xiaomi is all set to launch the mix 5 within display camera mechanism and ultra wide band technology and this will feature xiaomi's 3rd gen a 4th gen in display camera design yeah the mix series is made to showcase innovation and the mix so i won't disappoint you some of these specifications are confirmed by mix 5 certification 120 watt super fast charging is coming back last time we saw this in the meat and ultra 70 watts wireless charging ultra wide band which i explained is like a radar which works on radio wave to detect and connect with smart devices finally we'll have the gorgeous new full screen display so it is inevitable we are seeing xiaomi's innovation this year and for mass audience next year make sure to subscribe for latest news on mix 5 and me 12. thanks so much for watching your thoughts in the comment section and i'll meet you guys

of product marketing at xiaomi a happy happy 2021 to all of you and welcome to xiaomi's first online launch this year may the new year bring you new goals new achievements and full of happiness so i stumbled upon this photo from our me fan the other day and it reminded me that sometimes it is okay to live as a kid to dream big and let your dreams run wild and free and if you can dream it you can do it at xiaomi we never stop dreaming and more importantly because of all of your support xiaomi is currently the third largest smartphone company in the world we are super thrilled to have achieved this milestone our redmi and redmi note also made it to three of the top 10 bestsellers according to canalists and last year we launched the highly successful redmi note 9 series which was really well loved by our fans i'm sure there's truly a redmi note for everyone and in a span of just a few months redmi note 9 series has been well received from all over the world with 20 million users across the globe and in case you're wondering redmi note 9 series is still selling so make sure to grab yours now but redmi note series is more than just numbers it is also living for the challenge and to live for the challenge we first sent the redmi note 7 to space and next redmi note 8 we send it to antarctica and this year i'm super excited for the redmi note 9 series it traveled all the way to the deep blue hold in the bahamas stay tuned on our social media channels for the full video coming soon but living for the challenge is not just about being in extreme environments we can also live for the challenge by staying creative and inspired everywhere even at home and me fans took on the challenge to shoot like a pro at home so why don't we all check out this video [Music] is [Music] all right it is pretty amazing what people could do with their creativity wherever they are even at home so seeing so many incredible work from our me fans really inspires us to do better it drives our motivation to continue to do amazing products with honest pricing to everyone so which is why today we are super stoked to introduce several new exciting products to you are you ready so to start 2021 we are thrilled to bring another new member of the redmi note 9 series family the legend continues we'd like to say the redmi note series is about making the latest technology accessible to everyone so we ask you what you wanted most in your next redmi note 9. your responses have something in common and that is 5g so today we are very excited and very proud to introduce redmi note's first ever 5g smartphone redmi note 9 t ready set 5g redmi note 90 is ready for 5g it's ready to handle the speed of the present and the future so some of you might wonder how fast is 5g 5g on the redmi note 9t is so fast that it's theoretically 23 times faster than your average 4g speed and to put that into perspectives we tested downloading a two hour movie using a 4g and 5g smartphone under the 4g the movie took minutes to download but with 5g on the redmi note 9t it took only a matter of seconds to download the movie which is pretty fast that's gigabytes of download in just seconds well 5g is more than just speed redmi note 90's 5g is about smooth connectivity as well let's dive deeper before 5g typical mid-range smartphones had 2x2 memo what does that mean that's multiple input and multiple output with this data transfer is limited to two simultaneous data streams this results to average connection that often leads to lags and long streaming times when watching online movies i'm sure all of you have met this frustration of waiting for something to load still loading and having to wait for something for so long well the redmi note 9t solves this it has four by four memo which gives four simultaneous data streams for super smooth connection so whether you're uploading files working online or even having online video calls four by four memo will enable you to get more things done in less time four by four memo is actually powered by four antennas for a fast and responsive connection we've taken this even further by precisely deciding the four antennas to be symmetrically positioned for optimum 5g signal coverage with this design it also overcomes the problem of your hand accidentally blocking the antenna from receiving the 5g signals the antennas also switch automatically based on signal strength what this means is that you will always receive the strongest 5d signal reception we talk about the benefit of 5g speed and advanced connectivity and on top of that 5g is about bringing more convenience to everyday living redmi note 9t takes convenience to a new level with 5g plus 5g dual sim this is a rare find as only a few smartphones have this feature as of the moment with two different 5g networks you could maximize your network coverage to get the 5g that is always on so whether you're working or playing you could just use one phone but two separate 5g sim cards redmi note 90 is 5g ready it's ready for 5g speed 5g connectivity and 5g plus 5g dual sim and to meet the demands of the 5g we also coupled it with a super powerful chipset at the core of redmi note 90 is the mediatek demancity 800u it's a very powerful 5g chipset that is ready to meet all your 5g demands so you might wonder just how powerful is this chipset it is so powerful that even without 5g network coverage it outperforms a lot of the other mid-range chipsets so here's why first of all based on geekbench benchmark scores the mediatek demand demansity 800u chip alone achieves an astonishing 93 increase in overall performance compared to snapdragon 665. it also has a built-in 7 nanometer advanced process technology this is usually found only in flagship chipsets it also packs more transistors and components on the chip allowing your phone to do more calculations without getting too hot and ultimately they're delivering higher processing power while minimizing power consumption the chipset also sports an octa-core processor that features two boosted big a76 cores with a clock speed of 2.4 gigahertz and six power efficiency cores all of these combined to offer a fast responsive performance for gaming watching videos to multitasking using your favorite apps we also ensure that we have a powerful gpu to handle 5g speed the mali g57 gpu has a huge 280 performance upgrade compared to the redmi note's previous generation this delivers sharper video and gaming over 5g and in addition redmi note 9t will feature a brand new ufs 2.2 storage technology for selected variants that's up to 100 faster than ufs 2.1 this allows you to get things done even quicker like faster loading of apps nobody likes it when their phone gets too hot it amounts to problems like battery drain force shutdown and even long-term damage to your phone which is why on the redmi note 9t we've installed seven thermal sensors it uses machine learning to automatically adjust and control temperature of critical components on your phone this minimizes the chance of your smartphone from overheating mediatek dimension the 800u is also one of the first processor in the market to include an integrated 5g modem it is highly power efficient and thus extends your battery life of your smartphone so to sum up redmi note 9t is ready to give you unparalleled speed advanced connectivity and 5g plus 5g dual sim all this is powered by the blazing fast mediatek chipset one of the major concerns of 5g is how quickly it drains battery life but on the redmi note 90 it was made to overcome this problem redmi note 90 packs a 5 000 milliamp battery that allows you to enjoy 5g longer in fact that's more than two days longer and besides that long battery life we also upgraded the battery life cycle on the redmi note 9t so typical smartphones will have a battery that will run for two years before it loses 20 percent of its original capacity with the redmi note 9t you'll get almost three years of optimal battery performance and we didn't stop with just the hardware side of things redmi note 90's mu y12 also has powerful software features that bring out the fullest potential of your battery capacity redmi note 90 has enough power to enjoy 5g longer it gives you two days of battery usage plus it also supports 18 watt fast charging three years of consistent healthy battery performance and four different battery optimization features that you could easily enable in your settings so you have a powerful chipset and super fast 5g smartphone that is long lasting why not make a statement with redmi note 90's impressive design redmi note 9t features two colors to represent the new generation of 5g first we have my personal favorite the mystical daybreak purple it's inspired by the morning sky that symbolizes a new day and a new dawn next we have the redmi note 90 which comes in futuristic nightfallback it's inspired by the starry sky perfect for all minimalists out there so here's the two colors off the redmi note 9t we have daybreak purple and nightfall black redmi note 90 also comes with a unibody 3d curveback so it's really comfortable to grip it is also designed with a textured fingerprint resistant finish this means that it's fingerprint free and grease free leaving your phone looking really new and clean each time it's not only fingerprint free but also splash free a splash proof nano coating is applied to help protect against exposure to high humidity and accidental splashes we also brought back the two in one side mounted fingerprint sensor as many of you love from the redmi note 9 series only this time we made it even better it's more comfortable with no side ridges the fingerprint sensor also allows you to instantly unlock and turn on and off your phone wherever you are smartphones have become an integral part of our lives these days and so a crack phone can be very frustrating this is why we've included your favorite corning gorilla glass 5 as well to protect it against accidental drops and of course in case you need it still here is the headphone jack so you have the option to use wired or wireless earphones so here you go redmi note 9t adopts a sleek design that is ready to impress it gives you convenience with instant unlocking ease of mind with corning gorilla glass and splash proof nano coating all while looking new and clean with awesome stylish colors redmi note 90 is ready to impress and ready to capture the perfect moment as well and in case you haven't noticed we've adopted a brand new halo ring design that sports a 48 megapixel hi-res ai triple camera the 48 megapixel main ai camera is ready to capture all your memorable moments with utmost clarity or whether it is a night worth remembering with the night mode or using the depth sensor portrait camera to capture life's candid moments showing people at their most real like this one here and using the macro camera for unexpected captures from live simple pleasures and of course a front camera to let you remember how much fun you had so ready set and capture with the redmi note 90 it's truly an awesome phone next of course redmi note 90 is also ready to deliver an exceptional experience like no other you could enjoy seamless 5g experience we've included many many cool features so first redmi note 9t features a 6.53 inch full screen display so you can experience 5g high-res videos and gaming in full hd plus so what if you game or binge watch and tv for long hours redmi note 90 is also low blue light certified from 2 vineland this will help you reduce fatigue and eye strains coupled with great display is a great audio experience and for the first time in the redmi note series we're introducing dual speakers why we realized that dual stereo speakers today are mostly reserved for expensive flagship smartphones but today redmi note 9t is bringing dual speakers to the mid-range segment with dual speakers you can now enjoy audio that is both louder and more immersive dual speakers also got smarter with smart orientation detection technology the phone knows whether it's being held and so the sound channels will dynamically switch as you rotate the phone redmi note 90 also has many cool features that makes everyday living more connected so first we have the ir blaster this

macro lens of course you're going to turn the camera on yourself sometimes for selfies or for video calling now in this range typical competitive devices have a 12 megapixel camera it doesn't really cut it for people like me so you really can power up with redmi 9t's awesome 48 megapixel camera with the ultra wide angle to capture more and great software like time lapse it's clear 48 megapixel crystal clear in fact that redmi 9t's quad camera is a power up but i couldn't really say it's a power up without powering up your performance right not to worry this is going to be the most powerful

else is going to be really smooth and really fast now i'm proud to announce that the redmi 9t features the redmi series first ever six thousand milliamp hour battery 6 000 milliamp hours that's enough juice to power through two and a half days of use and if i break it down six thousand milliamp hours means 195 hours of bobbing your head to your favorite tunes 17 hours of binging your favorite shows

really going to love and really anybody who likes to use their smartphone will really really love but bigger battery bigger battery a bigger battery does that mean a bigger bulkier phone not today

note also made it to three of the top 10 bestsellers according to canada and last year we launched the highly successful redmi note 9 series which was really well loved by our fans i'm sure there's truly a redmi note for everyone and in the span of just a few months redmi note 9 series has been well received from all over the world with 20 million users across the globe and in case you're wondering redmi note 9 series is still selling so make sure to grab yours now so today we are very excited and very proud to introduce redmi note's first ever 5g smartphone you [Music] notes up guys mkbhd here so this is a fun one a couple days ago xiaomi gave me a first look at a prototype smartphone that they've been working on so similar to some things we saw at CES this isn't a real phone with a price tag that has a shipping date or anything like that this is just a functional prototype to show a cool idea they had and that idea is what would happen if you took those curved edge displays and just curve them right over the back all the way around to the back of the phone so you're just looking at full 110% screen and that is how we arrived at this the Xiaomi me mix alpha prototype also before we get into it shameless plug the merch is now permanently back so a lot of the stuff you can now just get whenever you want which is awesome shoptaw mkbhd calm first link below the like button that's pretty sick alright let's get into the phone so this is that xiaomi me mix alpha and it doesn't look like any other phone i've ever seen before and i've seen a lot of phones so you might remember there me mix line for a while has been that line of phones where they really push the design to the limits the first me mix was one of my favorite phones for that reason so that's why this one got the me mix name and it's definitely no exception the materials the specs and of course the display are pre next level so there's the frame of the phone which is this titanium alloy which is harder than stainless steel and the camera covers are all made from sapphire and the camera strip on the back here is ceramic i don't have a most pic handy or anything but i tend to believe that because this phone is heavy like it's clearly dense and has a lot of extra material extra glass for the screen etc and the specs not that they matter but they are pretty high-end which shows that they didn't have to sacrifice too much to make this form factor happened so snapdragon a 55 plus 512 gigs of ufs 3.0 storage 12 gigs of ram and a 4050 milliamp hour battery that's pretty good if anything you'd maybe want to see the battery even bigger but a lot of that space as you can tell is going to be taken up by the screen wrapping around inside the phone and it does have 40 watt fast charging which i will definitely get back to you in a second so clearly the focal point of the phone here is this screen i mean just imagine seeing someone in person using this display where you can see it from the front from the sides and from the back this is a 20 88 by 2250 OLED display with a very thin top and bottom bezel that wrap around to meet the camera strip at the back which is what I'll call it this houses a couple of things including the hundred and eight megapixel primary camera the 20 megapixel ultra wide with macro capabilities and that 12 megapixel telephoto camera and dual LED flash this one also even has an in display fingerprint reader impressively and it's 5g enabled and there's a whole bunch of optimizations in shammies me UI alpha software like the battery and status bar icons and notification counter are on the side of the phone here instead of at the top so it kind of cleans up the top to just be a notification pull down and not have to display all that stuff all the time which is kind of neat and it's also just like crazy no matter what angle you look at it it just doesn't look right like it doesn't look like a real phone it looks futuristic before you even think about any of the sort of practicality trade-offs also I told you I would mention the charging again I think probably the coolest part of having a wraparound screen like this is the charging animation so go ahead and plug this phone in with the screen off and the whole thing lights up and animates the battery starting to fill up the whole thing like liquid like liquid power flowing into the phone I love this and it doesn't stay on the whole time you're charging that'd be kind of annoying at night but it is pretty damn cool you got to admit and notifications will also do the same thing they'll sort of glow all the way around the screen which is super cool so seeing a stone on video is pretty sweet and that's one thing but actually holding it in person and considering using it is a total different thing and it brings up a lot of questions so now that I've actually held it and sort of used it I'm here to answer those questions so first off number one just what does it feel like to hold and use and so to that I'll say like I mentioned earlier it's heavy but what's funny is it isn't as slippery as some of those other glass phones like it seems like my finger is grippy with the display glass better than it is with some other materials and just overall it feels like well you're holding all screen so the immersion factor is very real and then you might be wondering hey wait a second where are the speaker and the selfie camera up at the front great question two different answers so there's a regular speaker at the bottom of the device still but for your phone calls that earpiece is replaced by an electromagnetic speaker basically that's vibrating through the glass to create sound we've seen this in previous mimics phones and there is no selfie camera at the top instead when you hit the selfie button you then flip around the screen to take a selfie with the main hundred and eight megapixel camera now weirdly that the selfie mode doesn't let you switch to ultra wide or do nearly as many things as the main camera modes which is a bummer but in theory this whole flip action takes your selfies to the next level because they're coming from the high-end main camera so all right then how good are those virtual side buttons on the screen okay I'll preface this by saying it's a prototype but they're pretty bad I mean the idea is fine in theory so there's a power button and a volume button on the right-hand side of the screen on the side and when you hit that volume button and you get it just right while it's rejecting the palm touch all over the rest of the screen but it's realizing that you hit the volume button it pops up this slider and then you can adjust the volume on the front no problem by sliding but it really only works for me sometimes like maybe there's a trick to holding it just right where you learn over time how to get familiar with the palm rejection whatever it is but I didn't arrive at this so this was a bummer but then there's the power button on the side that literally just puts it to sleep that one worked more often for me which is nice and there's also still a physical circular power button at the top of the phone for sleep wake that one always works but it's also more of a reach since it's way up at the top of the phone okay so how good is the palm rejection or recognition on a crazy screen like this it's hit or miss as you might expect so Xiaomi dropped off a little info sheet with this phone and on it they say they're using a combination of accelerometers gyroscopes pressure sensors and software algorithms to be able to tell when you're holding it versus when you're actually using it and to properly do palm rejection to me this seems like the biggest challenge for a phone with a wraparound screen there were definitely times that impressively works just fine but I also in terms of other times using the phone had of accidental presses not including that software volume button so it's hit or miss it's impressive when it works but it's really annoying when it doesn't and then what's the back display even good for what's the point well they've so far come up with a couple cool things that number one is the charging animation that I told you guys about already I think that's pretty sweet maybe the number one cool factor and then there's the fact that it takes the stuff from up in the top bar where it typically is and puts it on the sides to keep the front looking even more clean at the top that's alright the camera viewfinder is also a legitimate benefit so we've seen it before about using the main camera as your selfie camera typically gives you better selfies so you still get that benefit and then there's the special software mode where it detects when you flip over the phone and it activates this panel with some widgets that are a sort of a quick access type of thing so there's a timer in there the weather stuff like that that's pretty cool too and then just looking cool like that's that's mainly it it just it's pretty sweet to look at oh also another question is there a case for it yes there is I forgot to take video of it but I can show you this photo it literally only has a camera strip to anchor on and then it's sort of sort of protects the outside but not really I don't even know why you would put this phone in a case to be honest just except that you have a super delicate phone and then I want to point out that this display isn't flawless not to be a downer but just like when you were working with a prototype you naturally find a lot of things that could be improved and this was the biggest illusion breaker of the whole thing was the the edges of the display so right at the apex of those sides where it's rounding over the side there's a gap in the cover glass so it's not all one curved piece of glass there's actually three pieces that sort of connect together but when you run your finger over that apex you can feel it so it's not perfectly smooth and then from certain angles it even catches the light and rainbows a bit and you can really see it so that definitely takes away from the wraparound display illusion there's also a fair bit of yellowing at the very edges that you can sometimes notice if you're looking for it the camera doesn't pick it up as well as your eyes and also this sucker wobbles like crazy on a desk but that's I guess unavoidable there's no other place for it to lie flat the camera bump is literally just a stripe down the middle overall though I got to say I very impressed by this functional prototype a lot of the numbers on paper I don't know if I can really give them full credit like they say it's a 180 point six percent screen to body ratio but they're still bezels at the top and the bottom two point one five millimeters to be exact so I don't know if just because you wrap it around the sides you can say it's over a hundred percent screen to body ratio and also it's funny is on paper this spec sheet again they mention they say it's a 7.9 inch diagonal screen but it's not that big they're measuring it from around the back corner to corner of the display but really it's more like the size of a pixel four or an iPhone 11 Pro max but yeah that's about it in this world where we have crazy concept cars I'm glad that we also get to have these wild form over function concepts smartphones and maybe that idea turns into something someday so let me know if you think of a wraparound display concept in the comments section below would you grab something like this would you want a phone that's that crazy or is this completely over the moon form over function no reason to exist let me know what you think thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace you let's have a look at Xiaomi zahl new me 90 in the box you'll find some instruction manuals a protective case in sim ejector tool and a charging cable with 18 watt wall plug the me 90 has a notch list full screen design with a 6.3 9 inch AMOLED display which is great for watching video or playing games in this screen there's an all new and much faster optical in screen fingerprint sensor which feels really fast and snappy on top you're probably happy to find a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack next to the 20 megapixel pop-up selfie camera and because this front facing camera pops out it results in much more screen real estate while still being able to take your selfies also new is the ability to take panorama selfies with this you can take much wider photos with the selfie camera on the bottom of the phone you'll find a dual SIM card slot and USB C port supporting 18 watt fast charging of its 4,000 milliamp hour battery yes a 4000 milliamp hour battery that's right as it could give you about two days of battery life it means more usage time and less of this also you'll find a larger speaker that is a lot louder and gives a much fuller sound experience back at the phone has this really cool looking holographic layered design here you'll find a three camera setup with a 4 megapixel high resolution lens a 2 times optical zoom photo lens and a hundred and twenty four point eight ultra wide-angle lens and that's very cool it's kind of like having this but then on this new on the me 90 is the easy switching between the three lenses from the camera and it's super easy to switch to shooting high resolution 48 megapixel photos the me 90 is powered by the Snapdragon 730 providing increased performance over previous generations and faster is well better this is the all-new Xiaomi me 90 you can find out more at me calm Hello, how are you very good to all, welcome to your house, welcome to the top of the ranges and that state within these days to the channel you will have seen that we have published the network of the who 11 ultra and when publishing it something quite curious happened and that is that a question flies over a little to this terminal and the question is not another that is worth buying a lot of friendship very well buy a lot or me of 500 of 200 of 800 of 300 euros is very good but people will buy a boy measuring 1,200 euros like this my 11 ultra yo I believe in the review our position and our idea about this terminal was quite clear but what if we face the android phone one of the most expensive and one of the ones that sells the most units, such as the galaxy s 21 ultra against the sound m and 11 ultra There will be differences, which is better, these 1,200 euros are justified, we go with the video of the torn eggs and we begin with this comparison, an interesting comparison, especially for that, not to see at what level you are tm and 11 ultra, we already saw that It is a great phone but it can be compared against the best of the Korean firm Samsung well today we are going to see where the differences between these two phones are and at the end I tell you that I am going to get wet and I am going to choose the one I like the most That said, we start with the design, the truth is that we find two large phones, quite heavy phones here in this sense, it is true that they share quite a lot of feeling now that they are both very premium I think very beautiful with a slight curvature on the screen quite a bit Well-made ergonomic ones, I really think that they seem to me to be two very very beautiful phones that fit very well in the hand, it is true and this must be said that the mi 11 ultra is more different, not especially the inclusion of the second screen, you know It has a second screen on the back next to the camera modes, it is true that this makes it somewhat less comfortable, in some situations the camera module of the Samsung are better integrated but of course it does not include this second screen but hey this also makes it something different and differential that some users will say today because I like the eia more or me because it is cooler because it is more different because it has a more wow effect although other users They will say hey, I prefer the Samsung that is more balanced, it does not have this crazy thing in the protrusion to the camera so here I leave it to your liking but it must be recognized that both are very great phones in this sense, important things both have resistance to water and dust ip68 both have a fingerprint reader on the screen obviously and facial recognition although I must say that the one from sao me appears a little faster than the one from samsung as I tell you, both are quite heavy practically around 230 grams and for the rest of the land that obviously both terminals can be customized at the color level, you already know that they already omit in this finish that I like quite a bit And as a marble roll that I think it fits very well and is something quite differential Samsung has opted for quite traditional tones but with the roll this more matte which makes it a fairly clean phone in the design I think that the two are two of the best phones that we find in the market and there and each one of you who chooses the one you like the most based on power with this we are going to go through the hardware and here are some important differences we find on the one hand with Samsung with a processor that you will already know the oldest of you on the xxi about 2100 it is no longer what I would prefer you already know that I would always prefer which with 12 or 16 GB of ram memory 128 256 and 512 of storage efe that 3.1 already or my post has the triple snapdragon 8 which for me is the best processor that we find today accompanied by 8 or 12 gigs of ram a little less this must be said samsung has a bit more ram than a higher configuration of 16 and then p For storage we have 256 and 512 also with fs 3.1 batteries we have 5000 milliamps for both the truth with very good batteries for both but this is where one of the most glaring differences of this comparative 67 watts of fast charge for the xiaomi 67 watts of fast wireless charging for the sao mi 10 watts of reversible wireless charging while samsung only keeps 25 watts of fast charging has 15 watts of reversible 4.5 watts of dynamic wireless charging to this we must add that the samsung does not come with the charger in The box with which here the victory by a landslide belongs to sao me because obviously it has a lot more fast charging and also at least the unit that we have tested includes the same charger when Spain is not like that but at the moment it seems that it does so I think that in the hardware the winner for me is the sao mi first for the triple snapdragon 8 and then for the loading speeds where there is no color between one and o They are both 5g phones, latest version of bluetooth, we find nfc very good, dual sim, so in this sense, great connectivity and performance have not seen big differences either, I insist, I prefer snapdragon, obviously, if this does not mean that the samsung is going bad or that You are going to notice big differences between one phone and the other because I can assure you that they both fly and are really fast we got to talk about the software here I am not going to not investigate too much because I already commented on the network of my 11 ultra that we We are with a terminal brought from China with which it has the rom from there so I do not think the final experience of the software that it has to analyze, so I am going to go very far above in this section android 11 with me and 12.5 for the sao I will like some more or less but it is clear that I am going to reach a very very high level and on the other hand we have samsung with android 11 also with white white 3.1 which has also ll At a very good level, I particularly like it a lot and if I must say that I think that Samsung always has this little point, but not because of Samsung decks of Samsung pay of the ecosystem, not that it has been more worked than the rest of the Android brands with what Which here I do believe that it has a point of more Samsung for this compatibility and for the entire ecosystem that it offers us that is not an ecosystem like Apple for example that I think is the top but it is greater than that or my greater than practically All the firms that we meet today and with this we are going to talk about multimedia and here well I tell you that there is good news because they are two incredible phones, a multimedia section for the screen, we find few differences and I tell you from now on because I have really noticed very little the differences for the sao we have a 6 panel with 81 inches amoled with the glass victor 3200 x 1440 120 hertz refresh rate hdr 10 plus and 515 pixels per inch est The specifications will sound a lot to you in the galaxy s 21 because they are practically loaded also amoled technology in this case Samsung calls it dynamic amoled but hey more or less the same resolution 2 k we also find 515 pixels per inch exactly the same pixels that we have in the sao we also have 120 hertz we have the same size we have 1500 nits of brightness come on, they are two screens practically traced in theory and in practice because you will be seeing it now comparing one next to the other and I honestly find it difficult to find differences They are not the same screen but they are twin brothers, that is, in this sense there are very few differences, they both have curvature on the screen, the fingerprint reader is also integrated into the screen, I don't think they are two spectacular screens and for me all of the best of the market without a doubt both the sami and the samsung so spectacular and here for me it is a tie for ecause if differences are so small that I'm just able to notice with which these are very good news and excellent for both phones and is also very good audio positively surprised me there is no big differences have lost my samsung heard a bit louder but but the sao is also heard very loud and very well and very round with nuances I think the multimedia covers are two very good phones and it shows when you pay more than a thousand euros for a phone in details like this is Where do you see that really there they have spent a little more than what is spent on the speakers phones of 700 800 or 900 euros the truth is that very well there is an example and nothing double speaker for both and without a 3.5 jack I want and Now it's time to talk about photography, I'm going to try to go fast with the specifications because there is a lot to say and I'm going to try to summarize what the cameras have seemed to me, the first thing if we go with the sao and find ourselves se nsor of 50 megapixels in the main 48 megapixels for the wide angle and then a telephoto lens of 48 megapixels that allows us a by 5 optical allows us a 120 by digital and allows us to record video up to 8 k by Samsung we have 108 mega pixels in the main sensor 12 megapixels in the wide angle and then two more lenses for the objective with one by five and one by 10 that allows us a digital zoom of up to one hundred so that said, let's get to the point and my general summary is that there are very few differences and I already anticipate that whoever says that here one phone beats up the other, it seems to me that directly environment because it can not be said in any way that one is much superior to the other there are details in the more traditional, more normal photographs . What they have noticed is that in some points I liked the dynamic range of sao more, I think it is a little more worked and that in some situations especially the highlights where Samsung burns a p oquito already or it brings out a little more light and also in the dark areas but well now that they are not very many different I have gone very into detail but I do have the feeling that the dynamic range of sao is slightly better for me, now the Level of detail I think it is a little better than Samsung but I insist it is a very fine thread between both devices because the photos really are very similar until the interpretation of the color I would tell you that most of them look quite similar although there are small differences there are no differences huge and I have noticed a little difference in the night photographs where something curious happens I liked the night photography of Samsung more even though I know that many of you will like the one of sao me more and I explain now or I think it gets a a little more light the night photographs are a little clearer and the lights are more raised but it also has a little more noise samsung I think it gives it a little less light but controls the sound much better noise and it also controls the highlights better where it already burns me a little in this case night photographs then on the other hand the white balance I think that makes it more beautiful because in night photography it tends to yellow everything a little but it is that many Sometimes it must be yellow because there are yellow elements, see the lights of the street lamps in most cities where we take photographs, they are yellow, so the photograph has to be yellow already or it turns it more whitish which makes it It is prettier but it is a bit false because it really should show that color which is still noticed that Samsung does then it is true that the zoom I think the Samsung is slightly better than the Yao I think it is a bit sharper trying to match the Same type of zoom but it seems to me that the Samsung one is a tad sharper and I also like the macro of the galaxy s 21 the iaa a little more and as it does a better job that said insi This differences are very small, we are in front of the phones practically traced in terms of photographic experience and they are two of the best in the android panorama of that there is not much doubt and with this we go to video, they can both record video at 8 k They can record video at 4k 60 frames per second, a very top quality and here it has already surprised me or me because I expected Samsung to win or Samsung makes a spectacular video but I liked the stabilization of yao me at a level that I did not expect or It is really a very good job for the video and I would tell you that it already or I beats Samsung in this case in the video of the rear camera and with this we go to the self and a self and where there are differences obviously we find 20 megapixels for the sao me camera that can record at 1080 60 while that turns out to be a 40 megapixel camera that also allows us to record at 1080 60 here it does seem to me that the end cell is better clearly the one from samsung than not The one from sao me now well important asterisk already omits one thing that has a screen in the back a second screen that allows you to use the rear camera to do the fis because because it allows you to frame yourself with the screen and that changes everything of course If we compare taking a self and with the front camera of the samsung with the rear camera of yao ming yao beats me because of course it has this functionality that gives it added value now well if we use the front camera of both for me it is better the self and the galaxy s 21 ultra as you have also noticed a little more in the video although there are no big differences and that is why I have recorded a video with each one so that you can see the difference of blogging with a galaxy of blogging with an md- 11 ultra and also listen to the microphones of both because as always there is the test that we do with the front camera of both devices and also so that you can listen to the microphone as you can see I am walking with both of them. It is true that moving a little because they have been given quite quickly so that you can see a little the stabilization of the camera in different situations and compare the self and of one with the self and of another good one at the end we are going to talk about the price then look at the The price of l & m jon ceuta is not officially in our country but it will be around one thousand two hundred euros more or less the approximate price at which we can find it when it arrives today you can import it for a little less but well above a thousand euros without a doubt while the galaxy s 21 ultra has an official price of 1,259 euros although it will probably start to drop in price a little because it usually happens a lot in the samsung with which the price does not really make a difference are two Very expensive phones and with very little price difference between the two and having said that I'm going to get wet, I said and at the beginning of this comparison that I was going to get wet and what to choose one of the two phones Well, my reflection is the following, if I have to choose between the my 11 ultra and the galaxy s 21 ultra, I prefer the sao my I prefer the my 11 ultra I like its hardware more I like it much more especially for the load fast I think it is differential this aspect I like the processor more it seems to me that the design is more differential I think the second screen is curious to be able to use the main camera to do selfish and I would choose xiaomi now well I must also admit that a Many people would recommend them before the Samsung because because Jaume is a very particular phone, not everyone likes it, the second screen is a little heavier because someone like this is not very cool with this large camera module, I do not know, I can understand that it is not such a massive phone and as much for everyone as the galaxy s 21 ultra can be, that also the company a greater ecosystem etc. etc. but if I had to buy it for myself I would stay with him my 11 ultra and now I would like to know which one of you would stay, you can leave it down here in the comments and I will not be reading it and see who wins, leave when someone puts and beyoncé ultra or galaxies 21 ultra give him a like a see which comment has more likes and one from xiaomi or one from samsung see you tomorrow with more than this you already know that it does not stop and there is a lot of work to do we are not going to fool you see you tomorrow a hug bye hey what's up mr. YouTube it's a favor Italian here with another video and today we're looking at shadow Mimi been to or how others call it me feeds band here and as always this is going to be in harness review as it's not a sponsored video exactly as all my previous videos because I'm buying all this stuff on my own money and I don't owe nobody get it back to this gadget I must say that this is a great looking device and it works pretty well as the beauty x-ray item as well because by the annotate you need to be honest with yourself this thing will not help you get rid of your fat or make you live healthier for the same old reason because you're lazy as like I am you know this is true and we can't do anything about it unfortunately but and I say like overall it does this cool things like tracking your steps calories kind of it has a heart rate monitor and finally the greatest thing about it it shows time and date is that cool it's kind of old school now right so for a long time I was wandering and struggling to find the reason to buy this kind of a gadget and as you know one of the additional factors on getting this particular one was obviously the price now let's get to the unboxing part real quick I like the compact and nice design bug it's somewhat similar to iPhone one here on the top is the my feet itself looks shiny and expensive underneath you'll find the rubber band it's made from a soft rubber you like the feel of it to extract this device you can read down this clip like so great boss design decision on the back you'll see the heart rate monitor here are the charging connectors on the side and the last thing you'll get here is a USB charging cable no power bridge though so probably you have to charge your connecting to a PC or laptop you [Music] just immediately throw away all this paperwork as it comes only in Chinese which confirms that it was made for the internal Chinese market mainly you can easily find the app in the App Store in the Apple App Store and it works great with with iPhones it connects via bluetooth and what I like is that it connects and measures information with the Apple natives heltah after playing around with it I know this it has a pretty handy option which is call and messaging notifications I found this very helpful so thumbs up for that now let's get to the heart rate monitor it's based on a photo electronic sensor and it's not so accurate to be honest so if you're getting this gadget for serious sports or how prison your way wrong okay well hold on now there's not everything so bad here I like very life it took me about 15 days to squeeze all the juice from this little hardware it's amazing when you have a device that doesn't require to be charged every other night like your goddamn phone nowadays it is ip67 wire resistant so you don't have to worry while getting it wet you definitely can take a shower with it no problem but no professional scuba dive how it goes okay the display is a great update from previous me band generation you don't necessarily need the app in your smartphone to check on how many steps you made today you just get on this from button and they're going to show you right away the quality of this display is not bad it can be readable outside in Sun as well one of the best features I like is the alarm the beautiful part is that you get to wake up from a general vibration when your wrist no more annoying morning songs that make your life miserable right it was great for me and I woke up happier than usual at least for the first couple of times you should try another useful thing I see with this device is the little alert or idle left if you choose to the band will vibrate if inactivity lasts for one hour so if you're resting your ass and doing all day this will remind you to stand up and do but you can also ignore it and continue ain't doing apparently there's a lot to like here like in general what I like about me or shower me company is that they constantly update the firmware and in the apps and this makes you feel support and confident with their gadgets which sprinkle hey to conclude all this I must say that this was a farm purchase it can be a great gadget for your kids as well this could motivate them to get more involved in sports just to push them move more you know I think it looks nice and can be a great fashion accessory for you as well and I think this is all I had to say if you like this video don't forget to support me with like and subscribe for more to come see you next time P what's up and welcome back it Tierra's

so yep that is it guys for our redmi 90 so yep that is it guys for our redmi 90 quick review or first impressions video quick review or first impressions video again if you're attacker mary and see again if you're attacker mary and see you on my next video bye you on my next video bye So, probably the reason 
why you clicked this video is because of my thumbnail or because of my title. And maybe you're saying
that you're just being hyped by Mary. But, to be honest,
this is the kind of smartphone that is worth hyping up. Hey guys! 
It's your Tech Girl, Mary. And welcome back to my channel. If you guys remember,
we did an unboxing of the Xiaomi Mi 10 Ultra 
last year. I think that was just 
seven months ago and it's already been followed
by this brand new Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra. This is not the global version. Obviously, what I have 
and what I bought is the China ROM. And I as able to buy it
for Php59,990. This is so we have
a disclosure of the price. And, it also has a 67W 
power brick that has a USB Type-C cable inside. So, what makes this phone "ultra"? What are its specs,
so that right from the beginning you already know
and you have an idea. This phone has 6.81 inches
AMOLED display with 120Hz screen refresh rate. It also has the 
Corning Gorilla Glass Victus. Dual speakers Harman Kardon. With 5,000mAh batter capacity, capable of 67W wired fast charging, and 67W wireless charging. It has the latest Snapdragon 888
with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of internal 
UFS 3.1 storage. With 50MP wide angle camera,
a 48MP ultrawide angle camera, and a 48MP telephoto camera. And lastly, the 20MP front camera. And other than those,
it also has an IP68 water and dust resistance. And I think this is the first time
that there will be this kind of feature
in a Xiaomi smartphone. So, let's not waste any time.
Let us now unbox the Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra. (entertainment music) As you can see,
it's still in plastic. It literally just came
from the Lalamove driver. You know what?
I'm the type of person who bought something
but don't know what color I bought. Obviously, I was too excited
to, to buy this. I didn't even think
what color will it be, but I'm really hoping
that this is white. You know that this is China ROM,
so I won't understand the text in the back. So, moment of truth. (gasps) So it comes with another box.
And inside of this, it has the poking tool
or our SIM ejector tool. We have the manual.
And a transparent jelly case. This is it. Actually, it's kind of... What is this? This is a flagship, but the free jelly case in it
is kind of disappointing, because of course,
if you'll remember with the Mi 11, the free case that came 
with it is good, right? Of course, we have the phone
and nothing more. There are no included power brick,
USB Type-C, or whatsoever. And now we have this. It has a free 67W power brick.
And I do think it's really included
if you will be preordering or getting the Mi 11 Ultra
in China. I just want to say
that the Mi 11 Ultra has a global version unlike last year
when the Mi 10 Ultra came out. So, all those who plan
to buy it should celebrate. We have the 67W power brick. And guys, it's head 
is kind of big. And unfortunately, for me,
it's not Type-C. But to some, this is good news. Lastly, a USB Type-C 
charging cable. So, let's remove the plastic. Oh my god. Oh my god! 
Look at that camera bump. Guys, wait. Wow. That's insane! Sorry guys for my reaction.
This is really my first time to see this phone.
And if you're going to see this kind of smartphone
in person, you'll feel what I feel. (entertainment music) For a closer look, 
this is it guys. This is in ceramic white. And, it's also available
in ceramic black. Actually, I'm not sure
if my camera is given justice, but it's not just pure white. It's actually not a type of white
that I'm expecting when I first saw it. The ceramic is like
in the P40 Pro Plus. It's not just all white.
It has a kind of a marble design. If you want a better description, it's like marble tiles. So guys, I'll be setting up
the device first. Of course, let's put Play Store
and all that stuff. And I'll be back 
for my first impressions. Okay. So, I am now 
done setting up the device. We now have a Google Play Store,
Gmail, YouTube. While they are now downloading,
let's now talk about the device. Let's first take a look
at its huge camera bump. Is it really that thick? Yes, it's thick.
And I do think that it's double the thickness of an ordinary 
camera bump that we usually get from smartphones. And when I say "thick",
as in thick... as in three "c" guys. One of the thickest camera bump that I saw is in the S21 Ultra
and let's compare them. This is them side by side. And this is them if you'll look
from below. Anyway, I'm sure you won't
see them properly, so I'll just be 
inserting a b-roll. But, one of the advantages of this,
since it literally took the whole space
in the surface of it, if you put it on a flat surface,
for example on this table, it won't wobble. It's not noisy, you won't also 
have a hard time texting. But of course, expect
that its weight distribution won't be balanced. It will really be heavier
on the upper side, so just be careful
when you're holding the phone. We have a weighing scale here,
so let's try how heavy it really is. Okay. So, it weighs 237.1g or just 237. This is the heaviest smartphone
that I've handled so far. Just a full disclaimer.
If you guys will be getting the global variant,
which is I'm not sure if it'll be released here
in the Philippines, you will be getting
all the accessories— the power brick, USB Type-C cable. Wait a minute, guys. I was actually reading
the specifications online. Guys, it's included 
in being a tech reviewer, wherein you have a script, because I'm not gifted 
where I can memorize everything. Anyway, I'm just saying
because someone may attack us again. This smartphone
that I have right now is the limited edition marble. The 512GB... Wow. I didn't know this.
That's why it's so expensive. Anyway, at least now
we all know what's happening here, why it's got a marble design. Anyway, if you'll be getting
the regular ones, it doesn't have the marble guys
that I'm talking about here. I mean personally, 
like what I always say on my videos, 
I will prefer it if it's matte. But, since it's ceramic
and it's white, it's not that obvious guys
when you have sweaty hands. But anyway, 
additional information, front and back it's made
of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus. And the frame is made of aluminum. So build quality wise,
it's definitely for an "ultra". On top it has the speaker.
And again, we have the label "Sound by Harman/Kardon". It has a single microphone
and of course, its IR blaster. We have the volume rocker
and the power button on the right side. The left side is clear,
without having any buttons. Below, we have the SIM tray
which is actually dual SIM. And again, it's not expandable
via microSD card. USB Type-C port,
another microphone, and another speaker. I'm not that disappointed
if it's not expandable via microSD card, because, guys, I bought the 512GB,
so I'm good with that. Sadly, no headphone jack
but this is already expected from a flagship from Xiaomi... or any other flagship phones
that you will be getting in the future. So yeah, we have dual
stereo speakers, and I also noticed
we have larger set of speakers here if we were to compare it
to the regular Mi 11. (entertainment music) Now, let's talk about the display. Actually, if you'll look
at the display, it looks very normal.
It's like you're just looking at the regular Mi 11. You'll just know that you're holding
the Ultra phone when you look at its back. Peak brightness
can reach up to 1,700 nits, so it's probably
the brightest smartphone you can get right now
in the market. And of course, a WQHD+ display paired with 120Hz 
screen refresh rate. So even in the display guys,
it's also definitely ultra. Actually, so far, 
this is still for the first impressions, but when it comes 
to color accuracy and how bright the phone is,
you can really say that it's not just good in paper,
but also in real life. Just for reference, the peak brightness 
of the iPhone 12 Pro Max can only reach up to 1,200 nits. The S12 Ultra can reach
up to 1,500 nits. And, as I said earlier,
this one can reach up to 1,700 nits
of peak brightness. Insane guys. Promise. Actually, we have 
the brightness on maximum right now which is why it's kind
of overblown in our camera. (entertainment music) Another reason why this Mi 11 Ultra
is an "ultra" smartphone is because, guys, this is actually our first time
to encounter this kind of technology. As for me, they said
that it's not that new. Because, of course,
if you'll remember it, we have phones before
that has a screen in the back, especially the flip Motorola phones
that we had. But, of course, it's different
with the one that we have in the Mi 11 Ultra. And this is the reason
why we have a really huge camera bump. So, yeah. We have the 20MP
for the front camera, but guys, are you going
to use the front camera if you can selfie using
its 50MP main camera? Yes. That's possible,
because guys of its OLED screen on the back. So, for the main wide lens,
we have the 50MP. We also have 48MP telephoto lens, a 48MP ultrawide angle lens,
and of course, its 1.1 inch AMOLED display. It's obviously just
my first impressions video, but I will be doing
a camera test right now so you guys know what 
to expect on its camera application, and how to really use its cameras, on what you can and cannot do. So once you open the app,
of course we have the capability to use the ultrawide, wide,
and of course the 5x. If we will be going
to the more options, this is where we'll see
the access to the 50MP camera, night shot, short video,
panorama, documents, vlog mode, slow motion,
time-lapse, sticker avatars, movie effects, AI watermark,
long exposure, supermoon, and multicam, and a clone. First of all, I want to say
that all the cameras that we have in the back
of this phone are capable of shooting 8K video recording.
Now, that is "ultra". From the telephoto to the ultrawide, 
and to the main camera, we can definitely
shoot 8K, 4K, 1080p. Sadly, we cannot shoot videos
while using the screen at the back. So we won't be able
to vlog using its cameras. So, we can still video guys,
but using the front camera. So what is the purpose
of the screen on the back? Of course, you can see the time,
you can also play or pause your music,
you can take selfies using the main 
and ultrawide camera only. So yes, those two cameras
are the only ones we can use now, its telephoto lens can't be used. But, I do hope 
this can be improved on its upcoming updates,
so we can take videos using its three cameras at the back. So yes, you cannot vlog yet
using the back cameras. So, the main cameras
is using a Samsung GN2 sensor that has dual pixel pro 
auto focus and OIS. And for the ultrawide,
it is using a 48MP Sony IMX586. Now, for the periscopic lens
that has 48MP, it also uses the Sony IMX586
with OIS and 5x optical zoom, and 128x digital zoom. Actually, its main camera
has the biggest sensor out of all the smartphone yet, so I really do have a lot
of expectations on this phone. So yes, those are 
the specifications that you guys need to know
for this phone. I'll be flashing some photos
that I took today. I'm sorry there isn't that much,
since I just got the device. But, surely guys,
on the following days I will be giving you
my review video. (entertainment music) So yeah, other than those,
when it comes to charging, be it wired or wireless,
it's capable of 67W fast charging. And as advertised,
actually according to Xiaomi, you'll be able to fully charge
this phone from 0% to 100% in just 39 minutes. Again, be it wired or wireless. And of course, it already has
the latest MIUI 12 based on Android 11.
Do take note, it's not yet the MIUI 12.5 (entertainment music) And of course, for the chipset,
it's also "ultra" guys. It has the latest 
Qualcomm Snapdragon 888, so you won't be having
any problem in terms of performance. And of course, 
paired with 12GB of RAM. Actually, I've seen a lot 
of articles saying that it reached 800,000 
AnTuTu score. So, we'll also try it out now. So, yeah. That is actually it
for my video of the Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra.
Again, this is just my unboxing and camera test. We have yet to find out
what more can it offer and if I ever missed something
on our coming videos. I just want to say guys
that we have an ongoing giveaway that I posted in our Facebook page,
Mary Bautista YT. So guys, go to that
so you can join our giveaway. Disclaimer, 
it's not the Mi 11 Ultra. Have mercy on me. Anyway, that is it guys.

20 [Music] [Music] and i already near flagship when i hadn't guys mentioned flagship chipset now qualcomm snapdragon 865 a flagship camera specs 108 megapixels as a main camera better than you guys know 5 000 milliamp hour battery capacity with 3 to 3 watt fast charging and of course a 144 hertz screen refresh rate yes all of those specs guys can be found on xiaomi's newest device the xiaomi mi

with the samsung galaxy s20 ultra atmosphere [Music] [Music] displays a seminar flagship but this time xiaomi opted guys for a flat display which is very obvious and gets good then you'll recent combat initiative display because obviously i'm xiaomi mi 20 pro 5g po i mean ips lcd panel which is why guys some people i don't know it categorized it as a flagship device because of its display but i don't think that's the case for me guys i'd still consider this as a flagship phone from xiaomi this is not display again i mentioned 144 hertz screen refresh rate which usually guys they can only be found some gaming monitors gaming smartphones like from asus so yes every time that we will be hearing 120 hertz 144 hertz smartphone and also don't worry about the display case 2400 by 1080 pixels resolution so expect a really good quality comment guys every time that you will be watching youtube videos [ __ ] watching movies on netflix casino again full hd plus nato also okay if you feel like 144 hurts it's kinda too much for an everyday use to support 144 hertz you can always go down to 90 hertz and 60 hertz but disclaimer 144 hertz palladi xiaomi 20 pro i adaptive meaning it will apply only depending on what application or what you are doing on your smartphone all right guys so focus upon an attending camera which is the 108 megapixels main camera with f 1.69 aperture and again this camera can shoot up to 18 videos megapixels ultra wide camera and lastly guys landing on a 5 megapixels macro lens i won't go that deeply guys in a sample photo snapping since this is just my unboxing and first impressions so for now guys photos nothing [Music] [Music] which again five thousand milliamp hour and do take note that whenever i am you know testing guys or reviewing my smartphones average level hardcore or heavy usage detox so you'll have to look forward to it guys i think full review also just to add people wireless charging devices actually guys before timing procedures the last part which is the chipset which we will be discussing guys adding full review now that performance qualcomm snapdragon 865. 8gb of yam with 128 gig of internal storage actually guys your kind of storage sheet is a lot faster now latest ufs 2.1 i mean it may not have the latest and highest chipset which is again the qualcomm snapdragon 865 plus in terms of performance indigo can notice a volume difference plus 865. so yes expecting that guys performance pro 5g focus on you guys solid build quality stereo speaker setup but yes stereo speakers foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] chipset

into the comment section below that which one I am making false and get
bench for this one comes fast for buy that one and modern combat 5 so let's
see again it's a game and when it comes to game this one basically rocking and
these are hoping the apps like lightning speed so we have two different quality
between these two devices now let's see which one rockin into this sector so
this one sees this one finished loading and this one still loading now it's
finished so guys that's the thing okay now messenger same nearly same so guys you have seen
when it comes to the opening application these aren't xiaomi redmi v plus is
really really fast and rockin but when it comes to that game and opening a big
application this one on our nine light we beginning six five nine processor
this one really rockin so now let's download an application
from google play store and let's see which on finish the game downloading
fast for example we are downloading this one
wish okay now let's install these two apps together and let's say so this one
i have to click fast because it's showing and this option like this so
proceed and install together so this is connected to the same Wi-Fi and same
distance so let's see which one install this apps for the very first time this
one finished 100% and this 100% so which one comes first we are gonna see right
now so this one comes fast followed by that one so downloading an apps from
Google Play Store and finish it early Xiaomi is number one so now let's check
some RAM management if it's still there by yeah asphalt 8 no no no it's not
there so RAM management is really bad into
that sector then whatsapp this is in the memory but that one was not Chrome
nothing is in the memory it's loading okay unto the benchmark it's loading
both of this device they are really loading so Instagram it's loading Drive
they are also loading Twitter this one didn't load and this one loaded okay
Spotify no loading Facebook this one is not loading that one loaded right now so
you guys can see translate Oh No the RAM management is somehow 50/50 so
they are loading altogether Gmail they are loading nothing in the memory Maps
that also not inside the memory YouTube no they're all loading Shadow fighter still loading
so guys no RAM management is not that acceptable you guys can see but there is
another thing guys we don't play four or five games or
together on the background that's really point so I'm opening all those
application I had once so we have but still it's ok this one not loading this
one loaded okay so gig bench for now they are loading basically come modern
combat they are all loading basically so yeah messenger no they are all loading
so guys you have seen the RAM management between these two devices so I can say
here my opinion this one is opening the application and downloading the
application really fast than that one and this one on our line like this one
opening that games in lightning speed than that one
so both devices have its pros and cons this one is Snapdragon 625 this is
application oriented device and this one is big game big things oriented device
that you guys can understand and another little difference between these two
devices and it has dual camera here in front and it has single camera and back
side it has single camera and it has two your camera and other things you guys
can see the screen also over here so yeah that's the difference between these
two and the price would be the same as I
think and the honor 7x this one xiaomi redmi v plus and honor 9 light the price
would be same between this between these three devices or so so you can feel free
to take any phones like the way you want and I show you the systems over here in
my device in System Info you guys can see it has miui 9 it has the EMUI 8 and
android version over here 8.0 and here Android version you can see 7.1.2 so
that is this is the things I'm bringing in front of you so according to your
wish you can decide which on suit for you best I'm showing you everything
possible between these devices so it has also 3gb of RAM and it also has 3gb of
RAM. so guys thanks a lot for watching I hope you really enjoyed this video and
many things are clear in front of you between these devices and let me know
what do you think and don't forget to subscribe see you guys in my next video

marketing at xiaomi indonesia [Music] i'm started reading creative conspiracy really because i am trying to lead a marketing team and just trying to see how we can have a better creative output as a team so how teams can come together brainstorm basically some of the examples actually validate some of the things that i was thinking about whether um you know how can i effectively run the team [Music] my team actually i often tell my teammates that their success is actually my success and their failures are naturally my failure at the end of the day right if you don't share with another person right it's actually nothing and the thing is that if you see somebody achieving something that is more meaningful than your own achievement yeah that's my take maybe a coronary consultant like a professional organizer since i actually enjoy throwing out things that you don't need in you know that you have not used in a year i do that a lot [Music] oh the fear of not trying i don't want to look back in regret and say that like oh if i've done this the outcome would be xyz my biggest inspiration is actually my grandmother the difference between her and other grandmothers is that she's on youtube spotify instagram she also has a lazada and uh shopee and taobao account she has this growth mindset that i look up to very much i mean at the age of 91 she's still learning i look at her every single day and i'm amazed at every single thing or the attitude that she has towards life [Music] i'm proud to be me because i believe that i'm in a position to impact lives of people who have

evening and i'll see you very very soon have a blessed ramadan three makassi oh hey kelvin hi gracia alpaca bike welcome hi guys it's frankie from frankie tech good to see you guys again and here i'm sharing my top xiaomi phones so far of 2021. we've had a number of great releases but which is the best xiaomi phone in each segment let's have a look [Music] alright guys so no doubt that xiaomi has released a lot of phones so far this year in fact i would say they've released too many phones but within all those releases there are definitely a number of phones that just stand out in my opinion and so far as of may 26 2021 i want to share with you guys in no particular order my favorite phones from xiaomi so far this year so starting with number one the best budget phone or the under 200 us dollar phone so far in 2021 well you can see here we have a few contenders in this grouping like the redmi note 10 5g and even the poco m3 pro which i've recently reviewed and this phone for the price does deliver quite a lot but when i thought about it there was one phone that i think just did it better than both of these two and that was one i reviewed very early on in the year january 7th to be exact the redmi note 95g now unlike the note 10 5g right here and the poco m3 pro which went for a dimension 700 chipset the redmi note 90 i think struck the perfect balance with what you want in a budget phone offering 5g the mncd800 chipset and yes it did not have the high refresh rate of these phones but i just think now for the price that redmi note 9t 5g is just the better option now don't get me wrong i do think this poco m3 for the price and they nailed the price by the way guys is a terrific option but in my opinion if you're looking for the best budget phone and in this case a 5g budget phone look no further than the redmi note 19. now talking about mid-range devices and we've had quite a lot this year from xiaomi in this area like the redmi note 10 the poco x3 pro also a terrific phone and there have been many options like the mi 11 lite the mi 11 lite 5g that has offered terrific specs for the price but there's one phone guys that i think just stands out from the bunch and my best mid-range phone so far of 2021 from xiaomi is the redmi note 10 pro now what can i tell you about this phone that you don't know already guys this is the easiest recommendation of any xiaomi phone i can make this year with that gorgeous 120 hertz refresh rate the 108 megapixel camera and an amoled display just overall specs for the price are incredible now yes there are options that do offer a little bit more power and this is not a 5g phone but coming in at the price point it did this redmi note 10 pro just shocked the world and i feel we almost got a poco f1 vibe when this redmi note 10 pro was released of course i have it in this gorgeous gradient bronze me fan festival edition but no matter which color you get there's no denying that when it comes to a balance of specs display performance camera performance battery life and just the overall package this redmi note 10 pro is the best mid-range option from xiaomi so far in 2021 and now we go to a segment what i call the best affordable flagship now when it comes to this segment there have been a number of phones released from xiaomi and is probably the busiest of all these segments you can count the redmi k40 the k40 pro the k40 pro plus now the k40 series even this mi 11i does offer quite a bit of value but there's one phone that has an affordable flagship offers even better value and that's none other than the poco f3 and the poco f3 to me guys represents just sheer value in the upper mid range or near affordable flagship level segments now you could say oh frankie is not a flagship but yes it is because the snapdragon 870 is through and through still a flagship chipset but beyond that you're getting incredible design yes the main camera could be a bit better than the 48 megapixel but there's no other phone when you look at all the specs that i could really say is the best affordable flagship than this poco f3 and i do think in many ways this poco f3 is the spiritual successor to the poco f1 that was xiaomi's real first flagship killer and i think this poco f3 definitely fills those shoes very well now going into the flagship segment now xiaomi has released a number of phones in this segment as well like the xiaomi mi 11 and then we had that mi 11 pro that was released china only now i do want to pause here and say that the mi 11 pound for pound is still an incredible device and of course now with miui 12.5 on board it's only gotten better and if this was the only flagship phone xiaomi had released so far this year i would give this the award but that's not the case guys and we know what the best flagship phone from xiaomi is and in my opinion is one of the best xiaomi phones ever released the me11 ultra with the incredible rear display 48 megapixel triple camera setup an absolutely gorgeous 10 bit 120 hertz amoled display solid battery life with a 5 capacity and let's face it guys this is the pinnacle this is the best phone that xiaomi has released this year maybe ever and because of that if you're looking at flagship phones and you just have all the money to spend this is easily the best choice for you to consider the mi 11 ultra is the best flagship phone from xiaomi so far in 2021 so we've given out all the awards but i do have one last award to give out and that for me is the best overall phone and what do i mean by best overall phone it's the one that hands down if you come up to me and say frankie tech i need a new xiaomi device which one should i pick up without question there's one device of all these that i can just go to and say buy this it will make you happy you will love it the best overall phone xiaomi has released so far this year is the redmi note 10 pro i told you guys when i said it this is the easiest recommendation phone of any on the market and even as a flagship user someone who wants something like a me11 or even a me11i i think this redmi note 10 pro should still be on your radar this phone hits all the marks like i mentioned before but what makes this so incredible and easy to recommend is the price in that 250 to 300 us dollar price point a gorgeous 120 hertz display with a look and bezels that are pretty much identical to most of these other phones with that gm2 108 megapixel main camera i mean guys this is truly the poco f1 of this generation and is hands down in my opinion the easiest phone to recommend of the bunch and i do want to shout out some other honorable mentions like the black shark 4 pro like the k40 game enhanced edition those are great gaming phones personally guys i don't think we've seen the best gaming phone for my global audience yet and that's going to come with that poco f3 gt and that will probably be for me the best xiaomi gaming phone of this year and so there you have it guys my top phones from xiaomi so far of 2021 and of course the year is still halfway done but i'm sure that a number of these phones will still be here at the end of year awards when i give out the best phones 2021 so we shall see you guys we shall see but hear me up in the comments what are your top phones so far of 2021 from xiaomi and did any of yours make the list hit me up in the comments i'd love to hear about it and that's it for this video if you liked it give me that thumbs up and if you love the content of frankie tech subscribe to the channel hit the bell icon for future updates and guys i will be doing a very similar video but for the best phones so far of 2021 a more general look at phones coming later this week stay tuned so that's it and this is where i leave you by saying this is frankie tech signing off have a good one such an easy recommendation oh yeah you what's up in today's episode I'm gonna try to explain how all the Xiaomi smart products work in the Xiaomi smart-home ecosystem we're gonna look at how DS work and how you can set them up so I started off buying the Xiaomi air purifier earlier this summer this connects over Wi-Fi so you can control it with a mobile app which is great so you can turn it on when you're in the taxi back home for example the Xiaomi home app also contains their mobile store so I was quickly ordering product after product after product you can kind of call it Xiaomi smart home invasion by now my coffee machine is turned on the moment I get out of bed in the morning when I get home after 5:00 p.m. the door sensor automatically turns on the lights in the hall and as soon as I walk into the kitchen the living room or the bathroom the motion sensors there will tell the lights to turn on my air conditioner can automatically turn on when the temperature sensor notices that it's too hot or too cold I've removed all the old power strips for new Xiaomi strips with fast charging USB ports I know when the plans need water because of the Xiaomi plan monitoring device and I can turn on the cooker when I'm on my way home and all of this can be controlled as setup from within a single app the Xiaomi me home app this app is like the mothership of all the Xiaomi devices as most of them can be controlled and automated to it I noticed there's a lot of people wondering how these devices work and how you can set them up which is actually quite easy most devices work standalone where the switches and sensors do need to connect to a sort of a base station called the gateway this gateway works as a hub for the switches and sensors but it can also function as a nightlight it can be set up to be your door bell ringer alarm clock and home alarm and it even plays Chinese internet radio well if you wanted to that is you can easily install it by plugging it into a socket and setting it up through the Xiaomi home app the sensors and switches can then connect to the Gateway and they used to control all kinds of devices how this is actually set up is quite simple all the switches and sensors communicate with the gateway through their own network gateway itself is the only device in this group that is actually connected to your internet router any other shall be smart home devices can be connected to the router as well I've receive commands from both the sensors as well as the app true to app we can control all these devices and set up their automation this allows you to set up all kinds of rules and parameters and seeds we could for example set up this door in the window sensor in our window and the program a rule that the air purifier needs to be turned off when the window is open let's first look at all the different sensors and switches that Xiaomi has to offer at this moment the door and window sensor can perform a task when a door is opened closed or when it's open longer than a minute the light switch or doorbell unit can perform three tasks on a single click double click or long press it's a portable device but it can be attached to a wall with the included double-sided tape the motion or you and body sensor can perform a task when motion is detected or when no motion has been detected for a certain amount of time the cube is the most gimmicky one of the sensors it's a controlling cube that can be programmed to perform six different types of tasks turning at 90 degrees 180 degrees shaking it tapping it on the surface moving it and pushing it or always to control your devices like I said it's pretty much a gimmick but it actually use it quite often as it sits on my desk right in front of me I use it to turn on the AC by tapping it turning the lights on or off by turning it 90 degrees dim the lights by moving it forward turn on the air filter by shaking it etc the temperature sensor tells you what the temperature and humidity of your room inside the app it can also be used in conjunction with other devices to perform a certain task when a certain temperature or humidity is reached this brings me to the AC partner or AC control gateway this device can be plugged into power socket where your AC is connected and connect your AC with this gateway this is not just a Wi-Fi enabled power socket as it can actually fully control your AC over infrared and even monitor its actual power usage it also behaves as a base station and has much of that functionality it can act as your doorbell home security alarm and yes it also plays internet radio and then there's also this built an electrical switch this light switch unit can be built into your wall and functions as a regular light switch with Wi-Fi making every light a smart light works as a regular analog light switch but it can also be controlled and programmed to the app and completely integrate in that smart home environment this can be great if you have existing lights you want to be able to control with the app and it also comes with a Wi-Fi only version of that switch this pretty much has the same functionality as the round switch that we just saw but then it's got a different design all of these input devices kind of behave as an on-off switch and they're pretty easy to setup first you got to make sure that you've got two Xiaomi app installed and that you've added the devices to the app you can go to my devices in the first app click the plus symbol in the right corner to add a new device then select the device from the list and input your Wi-Fi network name and password to set it up when you've added all your devices you can go to profile automation click on the plus symbol in the right corner to add a new task in the first row you can select a starting condition and in the second row what task needs to be performed when that condition is met so a starting condition could be that the sensor in my hall detects motion so I'm going to select that and I'm gonna say that motion detected but I only want this to happen after 5:00 so I'm gonna right swipe on that and I can select the time period there I can set the time period at which I want this rule to be active so now in the list below I'm gonna select the task that I want it to run so I'm gonna select my whole light and I'm gonna say turn it on I'm going to select second hall light and turn that one on as well now I'm going to save it and that means that from now on between five and one if motion is detected in the hall the lights will go on now I would add another rule so that if no motion is detected by that sensor after two minutes the lights will go off again we might need certain rules just to apply on weekends or just on Mondays for example we can also set that up under the time span and make these rules perfectly aligned with your personal preference as you could just see we can set up multiple tasks to run per rule including sending a notification to your phone or running a whole scene of different tasks at the same time most part of the app is translated to English but there are some small flaws here and there but for the majority of the home devices the translation is already there so what products does Xiaomi have well shall be went all out over the last two years from their air purifiers water purifiers smart Kendall robot vacuum cleaner rice cookers scale power sockets remote controller you mean if I your webcam headphones earbuds sneakers bags and scarfs clothes fitness trackers smartwatches just lights light bulbs tower banks or others gain control dirty box for notebooks that wastes bytes t artifices a washing machine it by

out! Don’t disturb… Don’t disturb me It’s your dad’s interview now. Get out from here. It’s very important. And please tell that singing sensation To stop with all the... (peepdi) Or else I’ll come there and give him two tight slaps!
Go tell him. Hey Srikant… Hi, how are you? You appeared out of nowhere…  Hello, Hello… 
I'm fine. Thank you, thank you. It’s great to be doing
this meeting with Jhiaomi head. Thank you. Thank you, Srikant. But I must correct you. This is not Ziaomi or Zee-o-mee… The way to pronounce the name of our company is Xiaomi (Shaa-o-mee) … shh… Xiaomi (Shaa-o-mee) Xiaomi (Shaa-o-mee) Xiaomi (Shaa-o-may) Yes, correct! -Hey Dhriti, it’s not Ziaomi… it’s Xiaomi (Shaa-o-mee) Yes, I’m talking to his head. Yes. Get out from here. Yes, sir. I went through your profile, 
it’s very different. So, tell me, why would
you like to join Xiaomi? ‘Xiaomi’ is a great company, Manu. Great company. And everyone has your phones. And your company’s TV is also great. My wife, Suchi, watches a series on PatchWall The Family Man.... and she tells me that 
the hero looks like me. Might be so. Okay Srikant, I know you have 
applied for analytics profile But unfortunately, that position has filled up So, I was thinking wouldn't you be keen
for something else, some other profile. Yeah. I can be a Junior Analyst also. No Srikant. We are not talking about 
Junior Analyst. Um, we are looking for a Senior Analyst 
who will handle all the Junior Analysts. We have quite a lot of Junior Analysts. And since you have the experience, we
thought maybe you can come as a Senior Analyst. Okay. Srikant, your voice is breaking. 
Can you pardon, please? Yea, I’m telling. Actually, my WiFi is very cheap. so, you know, you know, salary problems. But I can manage any position. 
I’m curious to know,  if it’s a senior position then 
the compensation will be good enough, right?   I mean the salary must also be good… Srikant, don't worry about it. It will be a lot higher. It will almost be double salary. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Actually, it doesn’t matter on which position I am, Manu For whom I’m working is more important. Who’s better than ‘Xiaomi’? So, tell me, Srikant… If a rival company offers you more money, Will you go there? Never, never.
-Why? I’ve already cross-checked. Nobody else is giving 
more package in the market. Thank you, Srikant, for your honesty. Uh, can you tell me about your last job? What were your roles and
responsibilities over there? Well, there, I was working
as an analyst. What all things you used to analyse? everything, everything....  whatever came across. the projects and the analysis and the, 
and the challenge. Yea, everything. So, did you have a lot of teams under yourself? yeah, so many projects and so many
teams, but I was, I was the go-to person. You know, go-to person, for every project for all the teams that it was, there was one Srikant 
who was heading everything… I was working in Balochistan. You know, I was getting calls from my domestic
team to solve their problems on every level. I didn't know there was an Indian company
doing all the analytics work. That’s the problem. 
Nobody knows about the work we do. You’re right, Srikant.  You know, Corporates are the real unsung heroes. Yes, sir. Who was your client over there? My client was Moosa and Sajid Pvt. Ltd. (MSPL) MSPL… I’ve never heard of them. Yea sir. There needs to be too much security…
too much secrecy in our work. So, I was the one who was handling all these,
managing and handling all these operations. Uh, very good. We need an experienced leader like you because in today's world, you know, Srikant,
you have to go at a breakneck speed. Yes, yes. Break neck, break leg,
Break chest, break hand ... I mean, when I worked, I broke all of these. I'll give it all that I have. Very good, Srikant. That's what we're looking for. That's very, very wonderful. So, I'm looking forward to working with you,
but since this is a senior position, we want one more thing from you. Can you please create a case study 
on your experience and your work, your project with MSPL? Well… No, no problem. No problem, sir. I’ll make the case study and email you. 
Will that work? Yes, of course. You’re quite active on social media, Manu. I can DM… DM! Yeah. That’ll work too. Thank you so much, Srikant. I'm looking forward to working with you. Uh, have a great day. Nice meeting you.
Bye. Bye. Now how do I make a case study? Hey peepdi, please shut up. so it really feels like there are two types of flagship phones nowadays you've got one type where the company's kind of decided eh phones are capable enough already let's focus on design or software or marketing but then you've got the other type who are like screw that we're putting everything in it enter the me11 ultra this isn't trying to be a good phone it's trying to be the best phone money can buy the box is nothing special but also more importantly nothing's missing it comes with a usbc to headphone jack adapter the standard clear case and below the phone we get a usbc charging cable and a 67 watt fast charger let's get one thing out the way not everyone is going to like the way this looks i've showed the m11 ultra to seven eight people now and the reactions have ranged from that's the coolest phone i've ever seen to why are those so big to it kind of looks like it's trying to take over the world and i think the reason it's so polarizing is that this is confident design it's not trying to be a halfway house it's not trying to please everyone it knows what it wants to look like in this case a technological behemoth and it's running with it the mi 11 ultra openly leaves elegance and sophistication at the doorstep in place of an i eat samsung's for breakfast type aesthetic and i think it works it proudly flaunts its specs the lenses are enormous the camera module itself takes up a literal quarter of the phone and it actually isn't as much of a nuisance as i was expecting it to be yes it collects dust you can probably see some up top here but because the camera module doesn't stretch down that much it's surprisingly out the way of fingers and because it's so wide instead of worsening the wobble problem like a lot of these big cameras do it solves the wobble problem also this is not glass they've actually ditched it in place of ceramic which is often considered to be v-pro material but i'm not actually completely sold on that i think i just prefer the convenience of matte glass versus fingerprint city over here and this phone was already going to be heavy the density of ceramic pushes it further into one of the heaviest phones i've ever used it's not been an issue for me but it has been for some of the people who i've handed it to and god help whoever accidentally drops this on their face one night but more importantly is what this phone does when i first started using the mi 11 ultra i laughed because after months of phones that just could not match the samsung galaxy s21 ultra and who each deserve to cement how special of a phone that is all of a sudden we have a device that isn't just trying to trade blows and be comparable xiaomi is trying to kill samsung so i'm going to show you how and then i'm going to tell you why to preface this whole thing though they're about the same price aka a lot of money okay have a look at the s21 ultra's display i feel like the word phenomenal gets thrown around a lot but i can't think of many things more deserving of that title in fact samsung's phones have had such good screens that it's kind of just become a bit of a tradition that every time they release a new s-series phone that becomes the best display of the year until their own note series phone comes six months or so later and improves on it so it's pretty cool that i can sit here and say xiaomi's me 11 series of phones break that cycle ironically using a samsung made panel these are both a plus 6.8 inch amoled quad hd plus 120 hertz gorilla glass vectors hdr 10 plus adaptive panels how many times did i just say plus but xiaomi's is even brighter maxing out at 1700 nits instead of 1500 making it the brightest phone display possibly ever it's got a 480 hertz sample rate versus 240. that's how fast it's scanning for touches it doesn't have that slight blue shift as you tilt the phone and xiaomi can display 10-bit colors versus samsung's 8-bit it's not actually a 10-bit panel but it uses a technology that simulates having a greater color depth it is also quad curved so it slopes off on both the top and the bottom as well as the left and the right i guess to make gestures feel a little more seamless but equally because the only bits that aren't now curved at the corners i can't shake the feeling that my phone just looks like it had a really bad haircut more fundamentally though xiaomi has two amoled displays so you might have heard of the me band 5 their last generation activity tracker they basically taken the screen of that and slapped it on the back of this phone and on one hand this little thing doesn't really do much that we've not already seen before from those proper dual screen phones but a it's still impressive that it can do many of those same things whilst only actually being a side feature instead of the primary gimmick and b by having it on this phone in particular it enables something that that i think has the potential to be a complete game changer but i'm getting there it does also have an amazing customization suite you can have the time and inspirational quote you can have your face on there but it's just strange that they've made it so that it turns itself off after 30 seconds maximum because am i ever actually going to keep my phone screen down just so that i can check the time by fiddling around to try and double tap this mini display on the back to wake it probably not but yeah providing you're okay with the bunny ear corners i think xiaomi's killed it with the display but what about battery because the fact that the s21 ultra has got 5 000 milliamp hours of the stuff it's just meant that i stopped thinking about it and that's a good thing it's not like we ever get positive battery reminders like congratulations you're still on 90 so the less that the battery is on your mind the better the battery is doing its job and using this same scale xiaomi goes further because it charges faster and i've said this before faster charging is not necessarily a good thing it can degrade the battery it can mean they've got to split one cell into multiple cells giving you a lower overall capacity but they've kind of done fast charging here in a way that circumvents its main drawbacks like you're still getting the same 5000 milliamp hours of capacity and roughly the same six hours of screen on time in a normal day with all settings maxed out but instead of having a thicker battery to enable that fast charging we've actually got a thinner battery thanks to apparently new materials and as for how much faster it charges well instead of 70 minutes on the s21 ultra i'm getting 40 on xiaomi and while with xiaomi you can also charge roughly at the same speed wirelessly too that takes 120 on the samsung or three times longer now you might know that i'm not a huge wireless charging advocate and you would have to specifically buy xiaomi's proprietary wireless charger to get those speeds but it's tough to argue in samsung's direction here even though in all sensors its charging is slower they still don't give you a charging brick xiaomi does oh before i forget i did check my stats the other day and 49 of you watching are subscribed 51 of you aren't so if you are enjoying this video then a sub to the channel would be electrifying let's try and tip that balance okay you're probably starting to notice a theme here it really feels like with the mi 11 ultra xiaomi has taken samsung's phone as a template and then literally tried to one-up it in every aspect even its speakers sound basically the same just a tiny bit louder which is subtle but it's actually just enough of a difference for this phone to be one of the few that can pass the shower test i.e can i take it to a shower and still clearly hear the voices in a video that i'm watching xiaomi's even made it a faster phone i run the latest antutu benchmark five times back to back and you'll notice a few things firstly that xiaomi's display does start dimming itself extremely quickly and you can't turn the brightness up yourself when it does that but also that in every benchmark xiaomi is very clearly ahead and this is against the better performing snapdragon version of the s21 ultra xiaomi does reach a higher internal temperature but it doesn't seem to affect its ability to sustain performance can i tell the difference when playing normal android games no not really but i can imagine that anyone who's looking to buy an ultra phone will probably appreciate the extra three months or so of future proofing that you might get with higher overheads like that besides while both phones do come by default with 12 gigabytes of fast lpddr5 ram xiaomi comes with twice the fast ufs 3.1 storage here's the big news though the number one thing that has kept samsung in the lead is its cameras i'll link my last comparison using it up here but the crux of it is that samsung's combination of reliability and versatility are currently uncontested till now see it's easy to look right past the mi 11 ultra cameras okay not that easy they're half the size of my face but the point is it's only three cameras we've got four on the oneplus 9 pro and that's not exactly considered top tier but the thing with these three cameras is that each of them is extremely specialized like this main camera has the largest sensor that we've ever seen on a smartphone almost 20 bigger than samsung's already enormous sensor and this means three things one incredible separation of foreground and background it's not day and night over the samsung but it's taking great and making it better two more light if you go into a super dark environment you will find that its shots look cleaner than the s21 ultras and three cinematic video this is really more of a byproduct of the background blur but the point is the benefits of it are far-reaching as you can probably see i could spend a long time talking about this camera system because there is so much going on but the high level summary is this for the most part the xiaomi mi 11 ultra cameras trade blows with samsung this thing can shoot 8k video on all three of its lenses even if that is more for bragging rights than anything practical it's slow motion is not just twice as slow but better quality and its ultrawide camera is supremely wide noticeably more than that of its counterparts but samsung's colors are more consistent and for my tastes better xiaomi just takes too many liberties with it and so sometimes shots look spot-on and then other times i'm like wait did i do something wrong xiaomi can often crush darker areas and whilst having this enormous sensor does mean bright nighttime shots and beautiful blurred backgrounds in most night scenarios i wouldn't really say it's better and its plane of focus is so narrow that it can sometimes also mean that part of your foreground is blurred samsung has better macro shots with xiaomi's macro mode barely able to focus closer than its main camera and for now at least it's still the zoom champion and to be honest it's far enough ahead that it kind of makes xiaomi zoom feel a little misleading because i mean technically any camera can be any zoom i want it to be i could pull out a passion fruit and okay not that i could pull out an iphone 4 and zoom in 200 times if i wanted to i'd only be seeing like two pixels but the point is xiaomi marketing their phone as a 120 times makes it sound like it's better than samsung's 100 times when actually all they've really done is been more flexible with their definition of a quality photo or in other words to get the same quality image that samsung can get at 100 times this can only really get to about 60. so that's what it should have been labeled as based on 2021 expectations of quality however there's one wild card one thing that is both eureka moment genius and punch yourself in the face frustrating xiaomi second screen allows you to use all three of these main high-end cameras for the front too so while with most phones you're stuck with a single b-grade camera for selfies with the xiaomi phone you get the entire rig so you can take face shots with not just the largest sensor you can get on a phone right now this might just be the highest definition i've ever seen myself in but also the ultra wide camera which compared to how narrow most front-facing cameras are feels extraordinarily wide you get unprecedented low-light performance and crazy zoom too if you wanted that but because of how it's configured you can't take portrait mode shots with this it doesn't really work in social apps and the only way to take video is through a bit of a workaround and it's capped at 15 seconds it's 15 glorious seconds don't get me wrong but why would xiaomi limit it like this why would xiaomi spend all that money designing one of the greatest phone camera systems ever spend all that time developing and improving these software modes give you that second screen to be able to utilize them on the front but then prevent you from doing that everything's in place the hardware is here the software's here you just can't and so whilst this would have been a tipping point for me this probably would have been enough for me to say okay i think xiaomi's created a better camera system than even samsung as things stand it's about a draw siding slightly with the s21 ultra because the actual front-facing camera on the mi 11 ultra that you will end up using for a lot other things it's pretty meh i did talk to a xiaomi rep about this and she said that they're pushing for these features internally so fingers crossed but i can only review what's actually been confirmed and delivered however as you can see from this very rough tally we've been keeping xiaomi has kind of won and that's amazing the galaxy s21 ultra was the phone to beat and it's now beat but i'm also not in the least bit surprised by this result because i'm convinced that the only reason this mean 11 ultra exists is to beat the s21 ultra it's as if the entire philosophy behind it was to match every specification and then go further wherever they realistically could oh you've got a 6.8 inch amoled screen with a 1440 by 3200 resolution so do we but ours is brighter oh you've got a five thousand million power battery capacity would you look at that so do we but ask charges faster you've got 960fps super slow motion well that's cute we've just doubled that you zoom 100 times we zoom 120. you get the idea this is why my review of the xiaomi phone has basically just been a comparison to the samsung but why why is this phone so squarely targeted at them the answer is huawei two years ago huawei was exploding huawei was breaking boundaries they were on track to become the smartphone superpower of the world but then the us ban happened and as soon as the implications of that and no google services started to come into effect huawei fell and that's left xiaomi with the surprising opportunity to scoop up this enormous chunk of the market that huawei is leaving behind to become the global number one their only obstacle being the more established samsung who's trying to do the same thing and so all xiaomi needs to do is to make sure that they're doing what samsung's doing but either cheaper or better and by most metrics it's working apart from camera zoom which i feel like is mislabeled here the byproduct of xiaomi's targeted approach is that of course you're going to end up with an even higher end even more extreme phone i know some people don't like xiaomi's miui software skin but this is android providing you can put aside like 20 minutes you can just uninstall all the bloatware and you can set up your home screen pretty much how you want it it wouldn't make sense for me to say don't buy this phone because i have mixed feelings about me wise icons the important things are that it's fast which it is it's stable which it has been completely bug-free and ad-free in my experience and that you get good software support which you generally do with xiaomi flagships you'll probably get two years of major android updates and then quite possibly four years of me ui and security updates i've talked about miui a lot in my past xiaomi reviews so i'll link one of them up here but fundamentally if i would summarize it in like one word i would say options there is so much you can do in miui like even just the display settings are nuts you've got sunlight mode for really bright scenarios anti-flicker modes sliders for color temperature and even screen texture you can actually turn it into a paper-like experience if you wanted to so yeah me 11 ultra this is the new benchmark but i do think the galaxy s21 ultra still does enough things better that both have a place samsung has a more sophisticated aesthetic and i'd argue a nicer finish it's fingerprint scanner is not just faster in detection but also more forgiving and i would still say that this has the more reliable camera system okay subscribe if you enjoyed thank you so much for watching my name is aaron this is mr who's the boss and i'll catch you in the next you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you Hi all the internal storage space on the xiaomi cellphone, of course it will interfere with the performance of the cellphone itself, for example being slow or unable to run the apps, now to free up the storage on the xiaomi cellphone, the method is very easy, please watch the video and don't forget to subscribe first first on the syam kapuk channel, thank you, yes, for doing it here, of course, don't use any additional apps, yes, I only use the file manager apps on the Xiaomi cellphone, this application is the official default apps, so it's not a download from the Play store, yes, now I just open the apps then here I select the folder icon on the top then select storage okay next here will display the statistics of the usage data from the internal space on our cellphone, like here there are other files that take up 17.65 GB of space then apps and data, audio video images and other files, well here now I will do the cleaning one by one, starting from files that are not in use to removing other files on this cellphone , yes, now I just select for Apps and the next data here will be displayed apps that take up internal space, starting from the largest apps until The smallest example here is the largest there is a gallery apps here, it takes up space of up to 2.25 GB, yes, to clean it, it's very easy, I just have to select the gallery then select delete all data, don't worry when I delete data, for videos or photos it won't be deleted, yes and later you can use the gallery apps as usual then look again for apps that take up space, namely the piscart apps, yes, just like earlier, I did delete data, yes, for the piscart apps, you delete data, so for photos it will remain safe, then please do data deletion for some apps but remember for more game data OK, don't you delete it because later you are worried that your game data will be deleted, okay if you have deleted the data in the next apps, I are back now, you can see that the data apps has decreased, from the beginning, the use of 17 GB is now only 11 GB and if you want to delete it again then Please do it so that it is cleaner then in addition to the apps and data here I choose video again, now I choose videos that are not in use or videos that are large in size, it's easy to just mark them one by one for these videos which videos I really don't need yes, I just have to delete it, just mark it one by one like this, okay if there are many videos that have been marked as deleted, then I select delete if it's back then yes for some of the videos I have deleted and here you can see for the number 6,51 earlier 10 more yes now only 6 GB then now I will do the deletion in other files, these other files are files that are not detected or are not categorized in the files below such as apps videos or images so I have to search for them manually, how now I go back first then now I click on the three dots on the left above, then select settings, then after that, now I show hidden files on this cellphone, check it here, then I return next, now will show hidden folders on this cellphone, this hidden folder is marked with a dot on the front, like this There is a point then I open it one by one if a large file is found inside, then just delete it, like in this Facebook case, I found this large file, the file is 1/2 GB, so big, then if there is something like that, I just delete it then to do the deletion back to the other files now I scroll down then look for the MIUI folder here it is MIUI then I select the gallery, then select the cloud, here, select the case again, okay here, you will find lots of files, yes, these are very many hundreds maybe thousands, yes, I just delete everything, yes, here I just delete it on the cloud then select delete next now I look for junk files by name, well on the search icon then type apk hereI will look for an apk file that might be on your cellphone, now like this here you will find lots of apk files that I don't need, yes, if you don't feel the need for this file then please mark then delete yes mark all then I select erase okay now it's clean then now I look again for the thumb file type thumb yes here next I will find a large number of files, this is the same I delete, don't worry this will not erase any data it's on the cellphone yes I delete it next I look for the pic file again, just type pic then I click here you will find junk files below you can see I just mark everything then I delete it okay if all the methods have been done now I restart for this cellphone to optimize it okay it's back to life then now I open the file manager apps again I check again, click here, now you can see for the storage space again, I are relieved to click again here, okay, you can see for the difference if earlier the storage space was taken up 90%, yes and now it's not up to half so for storage space on my xiaomi cellphone, it's back relieved, okay friends, he is a short trick to relieve internal space on the Xiaomi cellphone, hopefully this is useful, thank you very much for those of you who have watched Wassalamualaikum [Music] [Music] [Music] subscribe

smartphone of 2021 but how most premium smartphone of 2021 but how does it stack up compared to the other does it stack up compared to the other big hitters in the android space so far big hitters in the android space so far this year this year the likes of the samsung galaxy s21 the likes of the samsung galaxy s21 ultra the oneplus 9 pro for example ultra the oneplus 9 pro for example and also is it worth spending the extra and also is it worth spending the extra money money on the standard me 11. i've been using on the standard me 11. i've been using on and off for the last couple of days on and off for the last couple of days and these are my first fairly detailed and these are my first fairly detailed impressions and spoiler alert impressions and spoiler alert this phone is incredible intriguing this phone is incredible intriguing weird and wonderful all rolled into one weird and wonderful all rolled into one but it might just be the smartphone to but it might just be the smartphone to beat right now beat right now if a couple of things don't put you off if a couple of things don't put you off you'll see what i mean you'll see what i mean and if you enjoy this sort of content and if you enjoy this sort of content make sure you are subscribed to the make sure you are subscribed to the channel with your notifications turned channel with your notifications turned on so every time i post you are notified on so every time i post you are notified no to fold no to phone notified no to fold no to phone notified what a good start to a video what a good start to a video so the first thing that jumps out at you so the first thing that jumps out at you is literally this mahusive is literally this mahusive camera rig at the back it's not for the camera rig at the back it's not for the faint-hearted that's for sure faint-hearted that's for sure the appearance will certainly not be for the appearance will certainly not be for everyone but what's under the monstrous everyone but what's under the monstrous bump bump is something pretty unique but more on is something pretty unique but more on that and the overall camera experience a that and the overall camera experience a bit later bit later elsewhere on the back you have the elsewhere on the back you have the xiaomi logo at the bottom and the mi 11 xiaomi logo at the bottom and the mi 11 ultra comes in either ceramic black ultra comes in either ceramic black like i have here or ceramic white i like i have here or ceramic white i personally would probably go with the personally would probably go with the ceramic black because ceramic black because i just think the camera bump blends in a i just think the camera bump blends in a little bit better little bit better on this model because unfortunately on on this model because unfortunately on the white model the camera array is the white model the camera array is still black so it does stand out quite a still black so it does stand out quite a lot lot had that have been white i may have had that have been white i may have actually preferred that model but actually preferred that model but that's personal preference if we flip to that's personal preference if we flip to the front we have a gigantic the front we have a gigantic 6.81 inch 120hz quad hd plus amoled 6.81 inch 120hz quad hd plus amoled display display and its peak brightness is 1700 nits and its peak brightness is 1700 nits 200 more than the s21 ultra 200 more than the s21 ultra crazy the glass is also the strongest crazy the glass is also the strongest from corning gorilla glass victus from corning gorilla glass victus so combined with this ceramic it should so combined with this ceramic it should be just about as durable as you can get be just about as durable as you can get on a premium smartphone right now on a premium smartphone right now punch i'll cut out the top left hand punch i'll cut out the top left hand side which i personally prefer to the side which i personally prefer to the center cutout subjective of course and center cutout subjective of course and this house is a 20 this house is a 20 megapixel shooter and i've got some megapixel shooter and i've got some examples of its performance in a second examples of its performance in a second and talking of performance this is and talking of performance this is another area where this phone is an another area where this phone is an absolute absolute beast the high refresh rate the max 12 beast the high refresh rate the max 12 gigabytes of ram the qualcomm snapdragon gigabytes of ram the qualcomm snapdragon 888 chipset 888 chipset the ufs 3.1 storage make the 11 ultra a the ufs 3.1 storage make the 11 ultra a true goliath true goliath so spec for spec this phone goes toe to so spec for spec this phone goes toe to toe with the very best toe with the very best so the only real difference in so the only real difference in determining how fast and smooth determining how fast and smooth a phone feels at this level is of course a phone feels at this level is of course software software and miui the skin that xiaomi create and miui the skin that xiaomi create over the top of over the top of android has always been a bit of a mixed android has always been a bit of a mixed bag for me some great things bag for me some great things and some things that bug me miui 12.0.3 and some things that bug me miui 12.0.3 is what comes pre-installed here but the is what comes pre-installed here but the all-new 12.5 will soon drop on the me 11 all-new 12.5 will soon drop on the me 11 ultra and it definitely feels like an ultra and it definitely feels like an incremental step but a fairly big one incremental step but a fairly big one and in the right direction new and in the right direction new animations have been introduced across animations have been introduced across the board including the board including new startup sound and power on and off new startup sound and power on and off ones to name ones to name a few you can opt to have your recent a few you can opt to have your recent apps displayed in horizontal order now apps displayed in horizontal order now more like stock which i prefer more like stock which i prefer and one great new feature of 12.5 is you and one great new feature of 12.5 is you can remove and uninstall can remove and uninstall many of the pre-installed system apps if many of the pre-installed system apps if you wish to really cut down on bloatware you wish to really cut down on bloatware something that older miuis have something that older miuis have definitely struggled with i love the definitely struggled with i love the fact you can now swipe easily between fact you can now swipe easily between your notifications and settings pull your notifications and settings pull downs downs it's far more seamless and me ui plus it's far more seamless and me ui plus which is kind of which is kind of xiaomi's equivalent to huawei share and xiaomi's equivalent to huawei share and you can seamlessly you can seamlessly connect your xiaomi phone to a xiaomi connect your xiaomi phone to a xiaomi laptop with screen mirroring laptop with screen mirroring instant sharing of files etc and instant sharing of files etc and checking of messages and notifications checking of messages and notifications now a couple of the disadvantages of now a couple of the disadvantages of having such a having such a chunky phone is number one it's chunky phone is number one it's usability for one hand and also it's usability for one hand and also it's sheer weight it's it's a pretty hefty sheer weight it's it's a pretty hefty device device but one of the advantages of it is the but one of the advantages of it is the fact that you can fit a fact that you can fit a larger battery 5000 mah in here is the larger battery 5000 mah in here is the same capacity as in the s21 ultra same capacity as in the s21 ultra and it really is an all day and it really is an all day it really is an all-day battery if it really is an all-day battery if you're an average user i've been getting you're an average user i've been getting roughly around roughly around five hours of screen on time five hours of screen on time it's okay it gets me through the day it's okay it gets me through the day fine fine not incredible one thing to note there not incredible one thing to note there is a special second is a special second screen on the camera module at the back screen on the camera module at the back which we'll get to its uses in a second which we'll get to its uses in a second but if you have this but if you have this on your battery will not last quite as on your battery will not last quite as long the same can be said for long the same can be said for the high refresh rate and resolution the high refresh rate and resolution options if you do run low on juice options if you do run low on juice thanks to its quick charge 4 plus thanks to its quick charge 4 plus technology and the 67 watt fast charger technology and the 67 watt fast charger that comes in the box that comes in the box the 11 ultra will charge to 100 in just the 11 ultra will charge to 100 in just about 35 about 35 minutes with fast wireless charging in minutes with fast wireless charging in around 40 minutes which is around 40 minutes which is some feat i will be posting some more some feat i will be posting some more in-depth detailed battery drain tests in-depth detailed battery drain tests over on my twitter and instagram over on my twitter and instagram if you're interested in that go and if you're interested in that go and follow me over there so up to now i'm follow me over there so up to now i'm sure you'll agree that this phone sure you'll agree that this phone is pretty substantial indeed it takes a is pretty substantial indeed it takes a hell of a lot of boxes hell of a lot of boxes but if you're going to be spending the but if you're going to be spending the extra cash on the meat 11 ultra over say extra cash on the meat 11 ultra over say the standard me 11 the standard me 11 then chances are you're probably gonna then chances are you're probably gonna be doing it for those camera be doing it for those camera upgrades so let's see exactly what we upgrades so let's see exactly what we get with the absolutely get with the absolutely mammoth camera module firstly it's a mammoth camera module firstly it's a triple camera setup comprised of a 50 triple camera setup comprised of a 50 megapixel megapixel primary sensor a 48 megapixel ultra wide primary sensor a 48 megapixel ultra wide angle lens and a 48 megapixel angle lens and a 48 megapixel periscope telephoto lens with five times periscope telephoto lens with five times optical zoom the mi 11 ultra is also optical zoom the mi 11 ultra is also capable of 8k video at 24 frames per capable of 8k video at 24 frames per second second and 4k and a max of 60 frames per second and 4k and a max of 60 frames per second so there isn't the crazy so there isn't the crazy higher frame rates of say 120 higher frame rates of say 120 fps that we've seen on some other fps that we've seen on some other flagships that are currently out right flagships that are currently out right now like the oneplus 9 pro for example now like the oneplus 9 pro for example but that will only really benefit you if but that will only really benefit you if you're going for the you're going for the ultra high end high speed action ultra high end high speed action shots or you wanted to slow down shots or you wanted to slow down something in edit and wanted it to be something in edit and wanted it to be ultra smooth 60 frames per second is ultra smooth 60 frames per second is still pretty good for that still pretty good for that 120 frames per second is obviously 120 frames per second is obviously better that's the main real difference better that's the main real difference there the overall camera scored there the overall camera scored 143 in dxo mark 143 in dxo mark really i think it's the best currently really i think it's the best currently right now right now on that specific measuring system and it on that specific measuring system and it excels in pretty much excels in pretty much every area it's a well-rounded rig one every area it's a well-rounded rig one thing i did notice if you take a thing i did notice if you take a portrait shot of portrait shot of more than one focus point next to each more than one focus point next to each other like two people next to each other other like two people next to each other and they are positioned at slightly and they are positioned at slightly differing distances to you the m11 ultra differing distances to you the m11 ultra is still able to keep the objects is still able to keep the objects furthest away nice and sharp and in furthest away nice and sharp and in focus where some other phones might focus where some other phones might struggle struggle brilliant dynamic range providing great brilliant dynamic range providing great details in both the bright and dark details in both the bright and dark areas of the scene areas of the scene both on the primary and ultra wide both on the primary and ultra wide lenses and the zoom is pretty stable lenses and the zoom is pretty stable with excellent clarity with excellent clarity early on with only the furthest early on with only the furthest distances within the 120 distances within the 120 times zoom range lacking in any real times zoom range lacking in any real detail detail which is to be expected now xiaomi will which is to be expected now xiaomi will claim to be claim to be the best in this department being 120 the best in this department being 120 times zoom times zoom higher than the 100 for example in the higher than the 100 for example in the s21 ultra but in reality s21 ultra but in reality the offering from samsung has 10 times the offering from samsung has 10 times optical zoom optical zoom to the five times on here so to the five times on here so presumably you're actually going to get presumably you're actually going to get slightly sharper slightly sharper and better looking photos in those and better looking photos in those zoom ranges as the meal 11 ultra will zoom ranges as the meal 11 ultra will have to do more digital enhancement have to do more digital enhancement compensation compensation due to the lack of the higher optical due to the lack of the higher optical zoom i did notice on portrait shots that zoom i did notice on portrait shots that the phone was the phone was able to snap some really nice sharp able to snap some really nice sharp images with really nice natural images with really nice natural background blur background blur i was impressed on most occasions by how i was impressed on most occasions by how well it dealt with moving subjects well it dealt with moving subjects keeping keeping faces etc nicely in focus but i did faces etc nicely in focus but i did notice there was a slight issue notice there was a slight issue with the shutter button sometimes almost with the shutter button sometimes almost sticking if you're taking more than a sticking if you're taking more than a few photos in a row few photos in a row it sometimes kind of freezes and the it sometimes kind of freezes and the processing of shots can also take a processing of shots can also take a while while as well one advantage of the primary as well one advantage of the primary sensor is you can actually sensor is you can actually get some really nice depth of field get some really nice depth of field almost portrait feeling shots almost portrait feeling shots in standard photo mode as well still in standard photo mode as well still maintaining a blur background maintaining a blur background and the processing seems to be a fair and the processing seems to be a fair bit quicker and now bit quicker and now for the money shot you can also use the for the money shot you can also use the real ends for selfies etc as well real ends for selfies etc as well if you want thanks to this wicked little if you want thanks to this wicked little second display second display it has been reused from the xiaomi mi it has been reused from the xiaomi mi band 5 smart band i believe band 5 smart band i believe and it provides you with the ability to and it provides you with the ability to view time set images of loved ones view time set images of loved ones get notification updates and use it as a get notification updates and use it as a viewfinder to take selfies using the viewfinder to take selfies using the better quality rear camera better quality rear camera they could have just made the front they could have just made the front camera which is decent by the way camera which is decent by the way they could have made that just a little they could have made that just a little bit better so that you don't have to bit better so that you don't have to do sort of that um but i love the do sort of that um but i love the innovation and i'm really excited where innovation and i'm really excited where they're gonna go with they're gonna go with this actual second display idea and what this actual second display idea and what about price about price well there's nothing being confirmed as well there's nothing being confirmed as of right now of right now but we presume it's going to retail for but we presume it's going to retail for 1 000 1 000 plus pounds dollars euros in that sort plus pounds dollars euros in that sort of wall park putting it in of wall park putting it in direct competition with the s21 ultra direct competition with the s21 ultra and the iphone and the iphone 12 pro max i think everything considered 12 pro max i think everything considered the mi 11 ultra is a the mi 11 ultra is a monster of a phone in more ways than one monster of a phone in more ways than one cutting edge technology packed to the cutting edge technology packed to the rafters with features and it might just rafters with features and it might just be the phone to beat right now be the phone to beat right now if they can get the price right and if they can get the price right and possibly possibly just undercut samsung and apple it will just undercut samsung and apple it will be be expensive but i think you get what you expensive but i think you get what you pay for there's an ongoing narrative pay for there's an ongoing narrative that smartphones are just simply too that smartphones are just simply too expensive now expensive now and i i kind of agree with that but also and i i kind of agree with that but also disagree as well there's no denying the disagree as well there's no denying the mid-range mid-range sector with the sort of flagship killers sector with the sort of flagship killers have done have done really really well over the last couple really really well over the last couple of years the quality of those phones has of years the quality of those phones has increased dramatically increased dramatically while still being able to keep the price while still being able to keep the price respectable but there is still a market respectable but there is still a market out there for those who want out there for those who want and can afford the very best and even at and can afford the very best and even at the premium flagship level the premium flagship level phones have got incrementally better to phones have got incrementally better to the point the point that's just scary like this phone can that's just scary like this phone can literally do everything literally do

nice rammie rammie rammie no.9 bro Remy Remy Remy damnit revving oh my [Music] Ramy no.9 show me how to install haluwa os or henthai os on the poco f3 the xiaomi mi 11x or the redmi [Applause] [Music] k40 hey peeps what's up munchie here back with another video and in this video i'm going to show you how you can install hentai os or helluva os on the redmi k40 the xiaomi 11x or the poco f3 do note all these three devices are the same just sold as different names in different regions so i do have the poco f3 which is running me by 12.0.5 stable based on android 11. now what are the prerequisites for this video well for starters you need to have an unlocked bootloader next thing you need to be on the stock mini ui for your variant of the redmi k40 the me 11x or the poco f3 how do you unlock the bootloader how do you install the factory firmware videos for those can be found in the description of the video next thing make sure your battery is charged at least 50 to 60 percent do not do this process if your battery is at 20 or 30 percent another thing make sure you have a backup of all your pictures videos anything important which you have on your device because you are going to lose them and your phone is going to be factory reset so again make sure you have a backup of all your pictures videos anything important which you have on your device next thing you need is access to a computer preferably an intel computer you do need to have the drivers installed and you also need to download adb and fastboot now drivers again are linked in the description of the video it is a zip file unzip it execute it as an administrator reboot your computer and you should be good to go those of you who are on amd computers and when you connect your phone to the computer in fastboot mode if you get the error of press any key to shut down we do have another amd fix archive file in the description unzip it run as admin reboot your computer and you should be good to go another way to fix the press any key to shut down error is to try a usb 2.0 port another pro tip is make sure you have turned off all your battery saver and hard disks turning off settings on your computer you don't want your computer to shut down in the middle of flashing a custom rom those things out of the way let us first go into settings and then you will go into password and security remove your screen lock fingerprint and face unlock once that is done go back go into me account and remove your me account once that is done go into accounts and sync and remove your google account once you have removed all the accounts and security measures make sure you reboot your device once why are we removing all the accounts and security measures we're doing this because we are going from one rom to another and i don't want you to be locked out of your own device now once you have rebooted your device next thing we need to do is we need to boot into fastboot mode so the first step is always to turn off your device and once you've turned your device off press and hold volume down and power button at the same time till you see the fastboot bunny and once you see the fastboot bunny all you need to do is connect your device to the computer using a usb cable and for the next steps let us move over to the computer so here we are on the computer which brings us to the question that what are the files which you need now all the files are linked in the description of the video along with the telegram group for this custom rom wherein you can always find the links to the latest downloads and the latest manuals so for starters you need a boot image file then you need the manual this is your flashing manual in case you want to use that then you need the rom itself this is again hentai os or helluva os whatever you want to call it this is for the poco f3 redmi k40 xiaomi 11x and the build which we are using in this video is known as fury then you need adb and fastboot do not we have downloaded this from the official google website and that is what i prefer and i recommend use the official websites when ever possible because they are trustworthy and secure next thing you need is the vendor and boot image file so everything except the adb and fastboot links to those can be found in their telegram group as well first thing we need to do is extract this platform tools do note this is an archive file i am using winrar you can use whichever application which you want to so all i'm going to do is extract to platform hyphen tools and wait for the process to finish do note the path here is without any spaces because spaces sometimes do create issues next up if you go inside this folder you will see we have another folder called platform tools and inside this folder we have our fastboot and we also have our adb right next up we will go back to the main folder where we have all the files so we are going to select the boot the rom itself which is hentai os and the vendor boot then make sure all three are highlighted and selected right click and say cut once that is done go to the platform tools folder where you have adb fastboot right click and say paste so basically what we did was just moved everything from the main folder to the platform tools folder because this is where they need to be next up press on the status bar or your address bar or the location bar whatever you want to call it make sure everything is highlighted type in cmd press the enter key this is going to open the command prompt again verify that you are in the correct folder so we can enter the command dir space slash p press the enter key again you will notice that we have fastboot here we have the rom here then we also have adb over here the boot.img file is here and vendor underscore boot.img file is also present over here next up let us open the pdf so we can have a look at the commands and here are the commands on your screen right now now unfortunately i'm a noob at windows so i could not figure out how to copy paste from there so i'm going to type it in so the first command we are going to do is fastboot devices and fastboot devices is going to check whether our device is being detected in fastboot mode or not so once you've entered the command press the enter key and as you can see our device is being detected in fastboot mode which means we are good to go if your device is not being detected over here again drivers are not installed linked in the description of the video unzip execute as admin reboot your computer and you should be good to go next command we need to enter is to flash the boot image so the command for that is fastboot flash boot underscore a and the name of the file so here it is the command on your screen fastboot space flash space boot underscore a space boot dot img and then press the enter key and as you can see it was finished successfully without any issues the next command is to flash the vendor and the command for that is fast boot flash vendor underscore boot underscore a2 vendor underscore boot dot img so here it is i have entered the command and next thing we're going to do is press the enter key and as you can see vendor underscore boot underscore a was also flashed without any issues now in case you get any errors make sure that the file names match so boot.img vendor underscore boot.img you will see over here we have the vendor underscore boot dot img next thing is we need to set the active slot as a so the command for that is fast boot space hyphen hyphen set hyphen active is equal to a so there it is we have entered the command fastboot space hyphen iphone set hyphen active is equal to a press the enter key and we just got a message setting current slot to a now for the next step we need to move over to the phone so we need to enter recovery mode do note that the phone is still connected to the computer no changes have been done with respect to the connection to the computer herein you need to press and hold power and volume up until the phone turns on so press and hold power and volume up and keep on holding it till you boot into recovery mode so that's what i am doing right now pressing and holding power and volume up i see the poco logo i felt a vibration bam here it is i am in recovery mode now i am getting a message of no command now you need to press the power button and while it is pressed then you need to press the volume up button again press and hold the power button press and hold power button press volume up bam we are in recovery mode herein you need to use the volume rockers to navigate through the different options let me bring the phone a bit closer so here it is i hope it is visible to you now and next up when apply update from adb is selected again use the volume rockers to navigate through the different options and once apply update from adb is selected then we press the power button once you do that you get a message on the bottom of the screen now send the package you want to apply with adb side load so we need to move back to the computer now now once we are back on the computer we are still in the command prompt we did not close the window we are going to type in dir space slash p press the enter key again you will see we have our rom over here we have the adb command and next up all you need to do is execute the command which is adb side load and name of the file so adb and space side load and then drag and drop the file so we can go to our folder over here go to the command prompt window let me go to the actual path here it is and just drag and drop this file over here it is going to plug in the full path name over here and once you have the full path name press the enter key as you can see it is now pushing the rom to the device and of course the process will take some time now while the rom is flashing i do want you to note something very important which they mention in the manual it says that flashing progress stopped at 94 so you might have a situation wherein it stops at 94 percent now they do say that it is harmless as long as the message followed by it is failed to read command no error so that is something which you should keep in mind do not panic if it fails at 94 percent as long as you get the message which they have mentioned and another pro tip is that if you have a look at the screen of your phone right right now it is saying verifying update package once it is flashing it it should change and you should get a different message so there it is you will notice that the message has now changed we got a message that verification took 114.6 seconds next up we are getting installing update step 1 slash 2. so we are at 93 let us see if we get the error at 94 percent or not i had 94 right now nervous music all right so it switched over to step two of two and there it is you can see we got the error of 94 percent failed to read command no error and as the manual says no need to worry about it because we also get step two by two on the phone and installed from adb completed with status as zero so i guess it is safe to assume that there were no errors at this point we can disconnect our phone from the computer so we are now on the phone itself it has been disconnected from the computer and after side load was finished without any issues here it is you can see installed from adb completed with status as zero we are still in recovery mode or android stock recovery now press the volume rockers again navigate through the different options and the option which we need to look for is called wipe data slash factory reset once that is highlighted we are going to press the power button and it is going to confirm so it wants us to confirm that we are going to factory reset again all your data would be lost make sure that factory data reset is highlighted use the volume rockers to navigate through the different options and let me try to get the focus working here it is we are now going to press the power button and there it is formatting data formatting metadata data wipe completed without any issues next up make sure that reboot system now as highlighted if it is not again use the volume rockers and then just press the power button to select the option and there it is we do have the poco logo back and let us now wait for the boot animation bam there it is fireballs hentai os hello os boot animation in the building which means we are booting into hentai os or helluva os on our redmi k40 or the poco f3 or the xiaomi mi 11x the first boot up of course will take some time so we have to be patient in fact that was real quick anyways this has to be like a pretty fast boot up let me skip the initial setup real quick they want to know whether we want to use dark or light for visibility purposes let us choose light for now bam here it is let us go into settings and then we can go into about phone note phone will be recognized as the pixel 5 because you do get the pixel 5 exclusive features on this rom so let us go into about phone and now if i tap on the android version bam here it is android version is 11 the kernel they are using is disrupt kernel and there it is peeps that is how you install hentai os or helluva os on the poco f3 the redmi k40 or the xiaomi mi 11x and that will do it for this video hope my video helped you likes shares

speck of dust [Music] in the future quality controls will be handled entirely by intelligent machines [Music] in the future a smartphone will be produced every second [Music] the future needs our imagination but more importantly it means our action this is xiaomi's one small step towards the future the future has just begun xiaomi smart factory [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] action my name is olivier hero dressen i'm from belgium i'm a me creator my name is kirtan i'm a cameraman from the netherlands there is a really good photographer and i like this that i always say the best camera you can have is the camera you have in your pocket since the phone is a very small camera really makes it easy to attach it to objects or attach it to people i can easily put it high i can easily put it low without too much rigging without too much going on it's a really nice breath of fresh air to use a phone to tell a story with this new phone the me 11 we was really inspired by the night mode so it gave us an idea of creating some content that is based between night and day so different shooting environments require different settings so for example if i'm shooting outside in the daytime because there's a lot of light coming through the lens onto the sensor and that's usually too bright so the iso setting needs to be very low and the shutter speed needs to be very high just to deal with uh the amount of light whereas if i'm shooting during the night time that's a totally different environment obviously the light levels are much lower so i want to higher the iso level and lower the shutter speed to allow the sensor to receive more light pro mode from xiaomi gives me these options but sometimes that is not enough in the last room that we shot the diamond room for example it was particularly dark so in that situation there were mirrors everywhere around we didn't have the possibility to add our own lights as they would come back in the mirrors so in this situation the xiaomi night mode was very helpful since the whole film is axed around this character and the way she she saw the world in a different very different and very original specific way we use a lot of shots that we made in macro and we go really close to our eyes when you're using a this phone is that because the sensor compared to the regular sensors of our bigger cameras are smaller that means that we can focus very closely mi 11 actually have a lot of capacity for using ai and one of them is the magic zoom we call it actually the each effect usually the the way you use this to really create a very strange thing actually happening in the in the films so what that does is the camera moves into the subject while zooming out or it moves out from the subject while zooming in so what that does it keeps the framing the same size but the relation between the foreground subject and the background subject changes for passing from a world to another we basically use a very i would say traditional way to do it we just open the door so the door represents the transition between our personal world and the real world so we chose to create a lighting effect this lighting effect that we made was a sort of water reflection shimmering effect to really draw the audience in and really draw the actors in as well so usually when i want to make a story very clear and very understandable i use a rule of keys basically the way we do it because our hero never sleeps and she always have this this vision we're using the same beginning the same ending so we totally understand there is a loop creativity for everyone for me it means that be able to shoot anything you want at any time whatever level they are if they are like student or if they are professional or if they want to learn and the best camera is the one you have in your pocket amazing right in such low light me11 can still capture such clear videos but do you know how much technology is needed to achieve this a one second video taken in low light is actually the equivalent of 30 photos if you want to take amazing videos in low light using a smartphone you need both great hardware and software first the one over 1.3 3 inch large image sensor of the mi 11's main camera has a larger light input second when taking photos in low light this image sensor will combine four pixels into one this is like combining four small windows to make one large window it allows a greater amount of light to enter the picture giving you more details and a higher dynamic range third the mi 11's main camera supports ois this means the camera can remain balanced even when it is shaken extending the shutter time and increasing the amount of light this allows your shoot in low light to be more stable and when you combine this with eis you get clearer images one of the most important things we've done with me 11 is at a new night scene video algorithm that combines software and hardware with the snapdragon 888 to give you an amazing videography experience even at night me11 can perform ai real-time calculations on raw level real-time brightening and noise reduction for every frame of your videos raw refers to the unprocessed original video information which has plenty of room for adjustment by leveraging such a powerful algorithm me11 is able to provide you with excellent low light video quality when it comes to night videography me 11 has no boundaries you'll be amazed by the high quality low light videos that you can create with this new smartphone smartphones have now entered the era of computational videography and xiaomi is committed to providing you with the ultimate technological solutions so that we can dramatically improve the quality of your videos maybe in the future you'll be able to shoot the next big blockbuster movie with just the smartphone in your pocket night or day me 11 allows you to create amazing videos xiaomi i've been a mi fan for one and a half years i am an english teacher and in my free time i also like to make a movie i also believe in the future of smartphone filmmaking [Music] it's coming to boost independent films and give chance to people who wouldn't have the chance before having that little bit of free time and committing it to something i feel really strongly about it makes me feel like i'm at my very special place to which i was born for if you believe in passion and never give up you will be surprised by what you can achieve [Music] what you see here may feel a little like science fiction but this is not fiction this is technology this is where smartphone communication performance is tested all global mainstream operator networks are tested here this is the sar lab it simulates the effects

thank you very much we've got a lot of content for the new product launch therefore we divide it into two parts today is the second day of the new product release in a couple of days we are going to celebrate the 11th anniversary of the founding of xiaomi today compared with 10 years ago xiaomi has made radical changes and we've been thinking how should we step into the journey of the next 10 years and our marketing colleagues suggest that perhaps we can develop a new set of brand identities maybe we can start with the logo honestly we have used this logo for 10 years and we feel so close to it if we need to change the logo this is a very difficult thing to do in 2017 the marketing department has started the preparation for the change of logo they found many famous designing companies to be part of this project and we heard many proposals from them and finally we find a great proposal and now we have officially decided to use the new logo from today please take a look are you disappointed at this logo we just make our original logo rounder maybe you can take another look at it this time the designer told me that he didn't just change the shape from square to round actually the internal spirit as well as the mentality of the brand will be changed i think you all know the designer of this logo he is mr kenya mr kenya is the world famous designer he has a lot of great women and when we talk about the change of the logo with him i think he proposed some great ideas to us one is very important he said xiaomi is a global company that comes from china and in the brand identity of xiaomi we should infuse philosophical thinking to xiaomi's visual identity and this touched me greatly and he said another idea he said the mission of xiaomi is to enable everyone to enjoy a better life through innovative technologies if we elevate this idea from the relationship between life and technology and if we rethink the visual identity of xiaomi then he proposed a new a brand new design concept so like we said it seems we only changed the shape of the logo but actually this is also an elevation of spirit due to kovi 19 mr kenya hara couldn't make it today but he prepared a video to explain how he designed his logo along with us including his thoughts and his design concept please enjoy the video you know my my after watching this video and then you look at this logo how do you like it [Music] actually the first time i look at this logo i was not familiar with it but after listening to the explanation by the master i understand why he designed it like this if you try it you will feel this logo is outstanding this time the logo can be combined with xiaomi's product it represents the intelligent technology in the future it's like they have a life and they can change along with the environment and this logo will not be fixed at a certain position it is freer it is more dynamic i remember once i talked with mr hara he said logo this logo is like a vivid emoji in different environments emoji can even change the logo can change so it makes the logo full of life so this is the design concept of mr kenya hara alive alive means the design that is full of life and the mr kenya hara has given us a careful and detailed explanation and my understanding is simple that is technology serves people and people are alive therefore technologies should also be alive and the new logo of xiaomi should also be alive so this is quite simple to understand therefore mr kenya designed the logo for xiaomi it is full of life at the same time mr hara also maintained the color of xiaomi because this orange color is so familiar by hundreds of millions of me fans around the world and he added silver gray and black color as supplementary color to it and silver gray is used for the alphabetical logo of xiaomi it will also be used on the product as well as in scenarios that is futuristic so this is how we are going to apply the logo of xiaomi very soon we are going to update the brand visual identity at our flagship stores the logo at xiaomi's science and technology park has also been updated recently later you can take a look at it in order to show up the application of this new logo mr kenya hara also designed a product for us this is a very small product but it has dedicated design it can represent the design concept of master hara let's take a look this is the first project with our latest logo this echo bag is made of the legendary dupont tyveks such a small echo bag mr hara has made multiple modifications to the design in terms of the position the size of the logo at the end of the day this mi echo bag fully represents the concept design concept of mr hara alive let's look at what is the dupont tyveks it looks like paper but it is not non-woven fabric its official name is called dupont tyvec it is the name on the dupont company it has the feature of both fabric and paper it is a mix of durability and beauty is as durable as fabric it is softer than paper and 50 lighter than regular paper so it is definitely high-tech material and most importantly juice is green and environmentally friendly this new material does not have any chemicals added in this production process it can be 100 recycled and reused also after being burned it doesn't have any other residue apart from water and carbon dioxide it is definitely a amazing new material and also you can wash it with water it is very interesting material it's a very simple and when you go out where the eco bag is fashionable and also green and environmentally friendly and that is on the ecoback designed by master hara and was that the ecoback we want more friends to really start to see our logo and understand our logo let's take it our new logo one more time how do you like it xiaomi's mission is to make the world in life a better experience with technology in the past few years we have created the most comprehensive smart ecosystem we started with just smartphones and now we have extended to over 100 categories with various products and they feature amazing user experience and a lot of new fans tell us when they enter me home they just close their eyes and they don't have to think what they need to buy because everything is amazing and now i would like to um invite mr chuhan to the stage he is the gm general manager for asami ecosystem he's going to show you the model room our showcase room [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] sugar foreign [Music] champion [Music] foreign [Music] m [Music] foreign foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] change it to [Music] environment you probably already saw some new products and you're right we have three new products for you and they are high-end aircon and high-end vacuum orbit and a high-end humidifier let's first look at the me smart ac with ventilation this is what it looks like you see the sun here's the legacy of the simplest simplistic design of the mini home products the details are also fantastic another angle still very stunning mounted on the wall you see how it melts into the entire environment and space and this aircon actually won the red spot award the german design award so what kind of aircon is it first off it saves energy and that is because we have the full dc inverter and it meets at the national new first class energy efficiency standard and one year that can actually save you 251 kilowatt hour also it supports 3d circulation so the wind does not directly gets blown onto your skin it is very soft and comfortable to your skin and we have an amazing name for this kind of breeze it is called natural breeze feeling like a carpet and feeling like wind from the sky and so the carpet breeze is for the warm air and the sky braces flower for the cold air and you can quickly brings you comfort of the ambiance and people usually have a misconception about aircons because aircons are often linked with a tube and there is a part of the aircon data is mounted on the wall on the exterior on the exterior but actually the problem with the traditional air conditioner it may actually stop the natural circulation for the indoor space which may decrease the level of comfort and also furniture may give off tvoc and formaldehyde and humans living in the indoor space may breathe out carbon dioxide hence compromising the air quality that is why our aircon actually comes with a ventilator so the aircon plus ventilator enable air exchange between indoor and outdoor space and you can always enjoy fresh air from outside and we also have the dual hybrid turbine system and it can support 60 cubic meter per hour of the air inlet which is definitely the peak value for this type of aircon and also you can use an edge just as a ventilator because we don't need aircon all the time throughout four seasons well for spring and autumn when you don't need aircon you can just use the machine as a ventilator as a stand-alone ventilator it only consumes 0.3 kilowatt per hour a day and of course you can use both functions at the same time and we also said this aircon plus ventilator can help with the air exchange sometimes outdoor air quality has been so great and in beijing right now we see a lot of poland in the air so even when air quality is good there may be pollens that is why we have these four layers of purifying function of the air to ensure that you get the cleanest air possible in the indoor space and everyone is health freak these days everyone wants to live healthily and we already thought about that for you and we have a uvc on a sterilizer which can sterilize and the residue bacteria in the aircon and also the aircon itself has self-cleaning system featuring high temperature and actually prevents secondary pollution by the aircon so with just one machine you solve nine health concerns that give it to voc format hide and carbon dioxide concentration or bacteria all of them are solved by our air complex ventilator and it's very difficult for us to know whether the air is good or not but we want that to be visualizable for you that is why we have a spring on this machine and on the display you not only can see the status of the filter but also the concentration of the carbon dioxide at home and there is a study that shows when the carbon dioxide concentration is above 1 400 bpm your decision making power actually reduces by 50 so when you are making major decisions please first to check the reading on the display to see whether the concentration of the co2 is too high in your room also it combines three functionalities in one so it's a three in one aircon an aircon that does not support ventilation is not a good aircon at all that is why it is a three in one machine and i believe that is the future trend and in the future there will be more and more air cons that support ventilation and air exchange now without further ado let's look at its price pier some peer prices well these are relatively competitive on pure products well first look at a specification we're definitely leading in the industry and the most important parameter is that the volume of fresh air which is uh way above our peers and the pure products are about 5000 rmb so quite expensive but what is the price for our high-end product was 3599 and there's more it includes some premium installation services you can make employment for installation to your door in our app it's important to have a good aircon and it's also important to install it well and with this premium installation service you don't have to worry about that at all so that's the first product from the ecosystem and the second one is our on a vacuum pro me robot vacuum pearl let's first look at this beautiful appearance then again with rose black and in the home decor black blends with everything and on the floor it always saw that it appears to be a natural compliment and why do we make high-end a vacuum rope it people may say but actually since the first product we have sold a lot of models and this product has been very very popular we've received a positive feedback and we found that our pure products on have certain issues so the first issue is that for the small objects on the floor they cannot handle them very well because for the robot vacuum they are not afraid of the big items but they are afraid of the charging cables all your slippers for example the charging cable we have a lot of digital devices at home and sometimes the cables are just on the floor so the the robot vacuum will be jammed by the charging cable moreover even though most of the robot vacuum can avoid the furnitures however for the legs of the furniture they cannot handle it or avoid it very well so for most of the product they have to hit the leg first before they can avoid this obstacle this is another pain point and this is a vacuum and mopping integrated vacuum machine so for mopping i think we all feel that maybe this machine will mop the carpets and make the carpet wet so these are the three pain points for the robot vacuum so how do we resolve these pain points first we use the binocular multiple dimension subject recognition system this looks like a very high level name but it is like me pro there is a top module in it so tough and rgb modules are integrated together to provide nanometer level obstacle avoidance experience it's like there is an autonomous driving vehicle at home with greater recognition system it raises higher requirements to the computation computing power this is the first time for us to use the dual processor system we not only have a quad core cpu we also have a bi-core npu to provide powerful computing power with great computing power let's see how they can resolve the pain points when the mini robot vacuum pro encounters the charging cable this is how it avoids it even though the cable is small the machine can still avoid it what about the table legs you see right in front of the table legs the meat robot vacuum pro will change direction then let's look at the carpets in the mopping function it can automatically change direction when it encounters the carpet so now we're talking about flows we can not only recognize carpet we can also recognize different materials of the flow be it the marble flow or the wooden floor so according to different types of flow you can decide your the your own humidifier capacity and the suction power you only need to do it once and the machine will remember your option and we have another great feature that is smart scene detection many people say this feature is not very new because in the previous edition it they also had the similar function but for the previous edition we need to draw the map of your home but the machine doesn't know which one is the living room which one is the study room which one is the bedroom you have to you have to mark them manually however this time the machine can mark your home automatically so the machine knows where your bed is and it knows where your bedroom is so you just need to say to the cli ai assistant that you want the machine to sweep the floor in the living room and the machine will do the job automatically after that let's we just said this is a premium robot vacuum so in terms of vacuum and moping we have the best configuration in one word big we have a 4 000 suction power 5 hundred million our battery and a 550 milliliter dustbin what about the price is 2999 chinese run so much about the second product let's look at the third product it is the meat humidifier problem so this is a standing vapor humidifier it inherited the media's design style it is a great match with your home with your furniture so this is a front view why do we want to develop a premium humidifier because we have developed humidifier for a long time and we noticed for ordinary and regular humidifier there are some pain points as we said this is a vaporizing humidifier most of the humidifier use ultrasonic for vaporization therefore they have high requirement for the water quality if you use tap water then the impurity will also be vaporized into the air and this could impose negative effect on your health this is why you need to use pure water to those kind of humidifier otherwise there might be dust and dirt on the floor but this time you can add any type of water to the humidifier and we also designed the air duct and fans and we there is only 32 db noise even though you put the humidifier by your bed it won't affect your sleeping and we also made some innovation to it this time we used an oled smart display on it like other humidifier it can show informations like the community and other information this all that smart display can also show the water volume in real time so whenever i have to add water to my humidifier i always afraid that i might add too much water but with the display of real-time water volume you don't have to worry about it it also makes the behavior of adding water very ceremonial and with such a great humidifier its humidifier capacity must be great and for me humidifier it can reach 600 milliliters per hour it is just the volume of a bottle of water so in just one hour we will be able to vaporize the entire bottle of water and we also have great battery life i think just one water tank should last for one day therefore we use a ultra big water tank which is five liter another interesting feature i would like to share with you many people say that after using the humidifier for a while there is a bad smile that is because there are bacterias in your tank so this time we use the triple anti-bacterial technology just like the ac with ventilation we have the uvc lamp for disinfection this time the filter cartridge is suspended filter cartridge so it will not be soaked in the water and this will prevent the growing of the bacteria and also the filter cartridge is used silver iron which is antibacterial and we are not using the humidifier the filter cartridge is still wet but there is a dryer system inside our humidifier which can dry up the filter cartridge this can also prevent the growth of bacteria and there won't be any uncomfortable or unpleasant smell of it so such a great meat humidifier pro what is the price of it 899 chinese one other three new products i would like to give to you and we're approaching the me fans festival and we'd like to give you some gifts when we launch the me robot vacuum pro the price will be 2 699 chinese region don't miss this offer and the humidifier we're also going to start the crowd funding and after crowd funding the price will also be reduced all three products are compatible with me home application you can use your mobile phone to control it you can also have a voice interaction with the product via xiaoi assistant just like in the showcase room of xiaomi these three products can be connected with the other xiaomi product so the whole your entire room can respond to your requirements and demands since the me fan festival is approaching we have prepared a lot of great product from xiaomi ecosystem department but due to time limits we cannot go through all of them you can go to our official website to see them they are all great products in addition to the official website you can also use wechat to search for xiaomi smart live and follow the official account of xiaomi smartlife there are also the latest information about our product and i heard there are also bonus and great offers special offers to you don't miss them these are the new products i would like to introduce to you now i'd like to turn it back to mr lighting thank you thank you i hope you can have a chance to go to the uh me store to have a look next i'm going to give you the me mix this time i'm going to give you the me mix fold let's take a look [Music] this large display it is stunning at the back there is also a red display and it also boasts the flagship camera system and we have all these fine processes this is a picture of the actual device very beautiful so this is the me mix fold i've been using this product for a while and i truly feel that this product is powered by a large foldable display and the user experience is magnificent a display like this we wake it up that very moment is magnificent and stunning this is a true fall display without any cut out or dots on it this is a true full display and this display is 8.01 inch very large so a very good viewing experience when you watch the video and for the viewing experience for me nick's fault we also support the adobe vision technology in terms of brightness color and the contrast ratio this technology will give you astonishing experience therefore it is very good to use it to watch videos and it feels even better when you play game with it [Music] so this is the gangster impact they told me this is a great gaming experience and i downloaded the genji impact and i played it for two hours honestly i've been busy recently so i don't play mobile games a lot because i always think that this place is too small but this time i use me mix fold and i played games in impact for two hours it feels like i'm playing the game on my pc or laptop so the gaming experience is incomparable with the foldable display this display is 2.01 inch big this is also a wqhd plus display it has 387 ppi and this is a foldable amoled display so these are the specs here very powerful it is supposed p3 color gamut with 1.07 billion color the true color display and hdr10 plus and i will not dive into details when we talk about foldable display i thought maybe we can make a comparison between our device and a tablet so i found the ipad mini it appears that our photo screen is smaller but let's wake up the screens what about now actually the displays are not so different from each other in size actually the next display is even larger i was also surprised and now this box for ipad mini is lcd display and here are these baths it seems like there is a gap from our and perhaps you want to try watching the movie with our device that's what i did i actually went on to ige and watched a few dramas and movies and when i watched movies i was stunned and that's the viewing experience that you get because the content of what you see it's 75 of the display and now we have the bullet screen and you see the bezels the bezels are perfect for the bullet screen the comments of the internet users you want to read but feel how true the the experience is and we compared our product with another two pure products and i think their sizes are probably not the most ideal for movie building and this one is 70 percent if not and the other one is 63 percent of the screen to body ratio i think for foldable phones what matters the most is how you feel when you encode the phones why do you collapse it all the time if it is a foldable phone so we want to give you the best experience of a foldable and expandable screen and we have a quality speaker to go with it as a stereo speaker i think this is probably the first smartphone that supports four or quad channel stereo speakers and we also are tuned by harper hayman [Music] if you only use it to watch movies and play games it seems to be quite a waste i think the best scenario is to use it as a productive tool in a business scenario actually now a lot of times i've used i've been using cell phones instead of a laptop so i read documents and powerpoints using my cell phones most of the time and let's try a financial statement and if you use a regular phone this is very difficult to see all these figures so usually my colleagues would print out to the financial statements for me to see the paper copies because it's very difficult to see all the details with regular display but now with food how does that feel with such report and it's very easy to use in comparison you see that display does not go to waste for those that don't want to bring laptops and ipads and tablets with you all the time well you can use the foldable phone and you can see documents and see the shares market and i hear some of you are checking well right you shouldn't be speculating in this stock market during office hours and so this is a tool for productivity and for that reason we really value privacy and data protection in the past few years we have endeavored tremendously on data protection and privacy and for our mix fold we have a special feature it is called one button one click stealth feature and just with one click you close all the speakers and gps locations and screens and that way it offers optimal security for the business people and some business people still miss the feeling of using laptops that is why we have what we call desktop mode three finger swipe you enter this desktop mode we can also call that pc mode in the palm or at your fingertips and this is uh the menu that you are all very familiar with that is lunch and here the command center that you all know very well it also supports multiple windows at the same time and you can operate these different windows at the same time these windows can interact with each other and when you have mixed fold with just a three finger swipe you can use it as a pc at your fingertips and we really invested into the big screen experience there a lot of the interesting ways to play with it when you um serve on weibo the chinese twitter just one tab to the left you still can see the feed and to the right you can actually watch video clips comments you can share it with your friend on different social media and when you go through an album you can just select all photos and drag them and drop them in reach out so with a foldable large display there are much more scenarios indications that that you can play with and when people see a foldable phone the first to have a question is it good and second is it durable for a foldable phone in the past one year or two years we've seen amazing technological breakthroughs and the level of sophistication in terms of technology really soared and the first time i saw a photo phone i was worried that it could break easily so in design we really devoted a lot of efforts to quality and i was told that the mixed vote in extreme conditions can be bent do you know how many times one million times so no worries at all and it has sophisticated precision based hinges and it is so precisely crafted that it can reduce the weight by 27 and also all the hinges have been bent for premium quality we have a non-magnetic durable steel plate behind each and every hinge so it's almost impossible to break it and the displays are as smooth as ever with this foldable large screen we have in mind how business people need to use it so we have 5200 mah battery [Applause] 1520 for a foldable phone is definitely the ceiling because foldable displays take a large space already and in order to fit 50 20 a battery into that space is definitely no joke and we also support a 67 watt of quick charge and let's look at our peers one of them supports the 4500 and plus 25 at the others 4 55 watts such a large display you would say definitely it consumes a lot of battery 5000 mah is just the threshold barely meets the threshold when you don't need to unfold it you collapse it and it's just a 6.0 inch of ammo light display this is also very good it's back compared to regular phones it is actually much thinner so with just a one hand you can hold it easily and comfortably it is a large display equal to a tablet and when you collapse it it is a flagship phone speaking of flagship you want to know those facts and performance so what is its performance like it always supports a qualcomm 888 the most advanced processor mobile processor we also support the butterfly pulling system which really utilizes each and every component for cooling we have another new technology which is it can accelerate the cooling process and the video and camera system is also a spectacular it supports a 108 mega pixel and for each pixel it can actually reach 2.1 micro meters and with such large pixels you can definitely excel in dark mode and low light and other challenging scenarios look at the landscape beautiful and spectacular mountains and these were also taken with our film beautiful glasses in a dark bar and see how transparent the classes are and the quality of the image and this was suddenly taken also with our phone this is a lamp and you can even see all the details on the lamp cast what about the outer wide angle also spectacular it supports 123 degrees and that's the beautiful sky that is shot this is a courtyard in beijing phone also supports 30 times of talon micro lens a pavilion at the center of the leg and sakura it also supports jelly as well as a mackerel photography it's a glass of juice like when we zoom in we can even see all these juice on the outside the exterior of the glass and this is a sponge perhaps you've never seen the porous structure of sponge at such close range and another photo that really stunned me was cotton swabs i've never seen q-tips like this when they are zoomed in they remind me of coal actually so the camera system of mexico supports a four core functionalities and they are supported by three lenses our triple lens system but how does this triple lens system achieve the cam functionality that is because of liquid lens technology liquid lens technologies based on bionic technology and it is at the future futuristic camera that works just like the crystals and human eyes that can quickly switch between telephoto and microwaves with just one lens it can support jelly and macro at the same time it is so much for the liquid lens and it is the first product that's supported in the in the me system and also the uh photography is just breathtaking and that thanks to a self-developed in-house chip this is an image processing chip that we developed in-house surge c1 and it it is independent from soc and the sun soldered onto the motherboard here it is this time what are the performances and functions of search c12 and both high and low frequencies can be processed at the same time along with our independently developed algorithm it greatly improved the aaa performance of image aaa stands for af awb and ae so this sensor can greatly improve the autofocus for small objects and low life mode and even in a complex light environment it can also handle the information it also has great awb therefore this chip greatly improves the image quality and camera capability of a mixed fold i know you are all concerned about the chip of xiaomi from 2014 we started our project for the development of search in early 2017 we launched search s1 today is the debut of search c1 so it is a seven year journey honestly we have gone through all kinds of setbacks and difficulties and we have devoted a lot of passion to it we have never stopped our endeavor the search c1 is only just a milestone of the journey of the chief development it is a milestone for xiaomi's image quality and it also bears our ambitions for the future image and camera capability of xiaomi i know this is a long journey and we there is a lot of all in our hearts there are also difficulties along the journey but xiaomi has always been perseverant and patient and we want to climb the high peak of innovative technologies in order to provide better user experience and we will not stop our exploration and the surge the wave of the surge will never be stopped so this is me mick's fault for such a fine foldable display what how do we price it let's look at our peers honestly smartphones with a foldable display is equivalent to two smartphones and the large photo display is also very expensive because they are two amoled display after a long time of r d we have invested so much in it this time mixed fold is a little expensive it will be 9999 we hope mixed food can be within 10 000 chinese rum so that all the me fans will be able to enjoy the fun of foldable display and we have two editions one is 12 plus 256 gb 9999 12 plus 512 gb 10 999 chinese one we also have a special edition available this is a ceramic specialization this is also a latest processing with a 3d ceramics we try to simulate the texture of a kevlar this is a high-end and edge cutting processing and we developed the first 16 gb mid device 16 plus 512 gigabytes for this top level configuration mix fold its price will be 12 999 chinese run and we also provide several types of cases for me makes fold [Music] fiber case maybe we can use an actual device to show you [Applause] let me show you let me unfold this display magnificent isn't it do you believe it now this display is even bigger than the ipad mini whether you're reading the financial statement whether you're playing the game or watching the video the viewing experience will be great and also the characters on it are also large so if you have difficulties reading small characters you can also use the foldable display i don't use it i don't need it and the grip in one hand is also great the cases we're going to provide include for example this case so this is a case with a kevlar texture and we also have a flip case i really like the flip case so you just need to open the case and unfold the display and you can also use it like this and the color of this case is also great later you can go to the experience booth to take a look i think this is a very practical smartphone with a foldable display thank you very much okay um will be produced a hundred percent at me smart factory so a great achievement for me smart factory it has very strong capability in many in manufacturing and production of smartphones and devices and there are also other premium services for mixed fold because when we get into the high end market we are also improving our level of service first we have dedicated assistance customer service and we also have on-site repair and we also and you don't need to pay any logistics phase please if you need to change the display you can also enjoy a 50 discount for the first time display exchange so we do have a lot of premium experiences three months in this year xiaomi has completed its deployment in high range market from 3299 to 12 999 chinese one we have launched five smartphones meeting s me 11 mi 11 pro me ultra and me mix folds while we get into the high range market what is the next goal that is to get into the high-end laptop markets today i'm going to be introducing the mi laptop pro today i'm going to give you the mi laptop pro 15. this is a beautifully designed laptop it is also ultra thin and lightweight with powerful performance it is only 15.9 millimeter feet so it is very light it is also dedicated it adopts the top level processing technologies for example we use the six series aerospace grade aluminum the cnc unibody manufacturing process and the 170 ceramic sand blasting process this time the laptop comes in two color variants gray and silver let's take a look so [Music] [Music] civil [Applause] it boasts the latest intel core processor processor the 35-35 w processor with i5 and y7 i7 it is also boosted by nvidia geforce mx450 this discrete graphic card it is also boosted by the advanced cooling system it is also upgraded to wi-fi 6. it also sports 100 watts fast charging a laptop like these we also got the intel apple platform evo platform certification maybe you don't know the evil platform but the product manager told me that this certification is very strictly down we have to pass 100 tests and this is the highest level certification in the laptop market and i searched on jd.com only less than 20 laptops have evil certification and for 15 inch laptop me laptop pro has the evil platform certification therefore in the laptop market evo certification means you can just buy this laptop with your eyes closed and we also used master display for this laptop we used the best display for the mid laptop this is a 3.5 k display it is a retina display it supports 261 ppi the precision is even higher than the macbook and each display is co collaborates it upon shipment for a true color display for such a fine display it is also protected by the corning gorilla glass therefore it looks beautiful [Music] and also the four bezels are narrow and its screen to body ratio is 93 percent and this is also the golden proportion for the laptop market which is 16 to 10 and we also add light sensor to this laptop brightness of the display can be adjusted according to the ambient light therefore one hearted design do you like this display this is already the top notch display in the laptop market but as we are moving into the high range market we actually have higher ambition and we want this display to be an oled display [Music] in the smartphone market all led has been popular it feels like it is not a big deal but for a large oled display therefore in the tv market and in the laptop market you rarely seen the oled display i also searched on jd.com i only found two or three results and all of them are over what 10 000 chinese one very expensive therefore we determined to use the oled display for our high-end laptop and this is the laces the e4011 display brightness can reach up to 600 units it also supports 100 p3 color gamuts 1.07 billion color and the contrast ratio is up to one million to one [Music] our display actually has it stands for video electronics standard association and in the industry it is the most influential industry for industry standard setter and we actually are certified for vasa 500 which is the highest level for a laptop and this display not only that also is certified by tube for hardware grade low blue light sometimes we sit in front of the laptop for 5 hours 10 hours and staring at spraying for that long time means you really need to protect our eyes and we also support dc light dimming function that is sun the xiaomi laptop pro that we have for you the best laptop we have ever produced how does the

planned for our 11th anniversary on tech talk please come and celebrate our birthday with us and for that we have a lot of interesting activities and events planned for you [Music] i really want to talk about the word alive my colleagues prepared a video to show you the new brand profile featuring a life and then i'll tell you the story behind it uh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] just a few days ago i talked to someone who's really knowledgeable and cultured we went for a run together in olympics park and that person is we really hit it off and had a great conversation we're actually very different people we came from a completely different background and after a long time i've finally found something in common which is he also studied computer science back in university and then we finally could talk about something that we had in common so i asked him why did you decide to become a journalist after wars computer science is such a great major [Music] a lot of changes and he wondered why did i make so many different choices so i told him that indeed i've made a lot of different choices along the way well you can understand this my rom rom has been refreshed quite a lot of times and these are the transformations that i have gone through what uh the first transformation happened when i was still at kingsoft i was only 28. [Music] and i'm the second person from left i was a passionate programmer and back then i thought that's my life career in 1998 mr chill asked me to become the ceo perhaps you don't believe me when i tell you that i actually said no and then mr chill persisted i thought well let me give it a try maybe when they find someone better i could go back to become to continue to be a programmer but something happened a colleague was actually helping me organizing my backup hard drive accidentally he formatted my entire hard drive all the programs that i had written was gone overnight i still remember his name leo guangmi so there was no option i couldn't go back to be a programmer anymore so i started to study sales marketing commerce and my life changed i started to embark on a completely different life journey it was probably a choice that was forced upon me you could say the second transformation happened in 2007 when i decided to become a professional android investor it's sort of related to my experience on of launching joeyo.com i don't know how many of you still remember that website which was actually established 21 years ago in the year of 2000 and it was the largest e-commerce back then but it was a very difficult journey we couldn't get enough finances so we sold it to amazon it was very difficult for entrepreneurs back then we had no idea how to be entrepreneurs we had no idea how to get money so after king soft became listed i left and became a dedicated and professional full-time android investor because i wanted to help more entrepreneurs with my contribution so that their dreams that could be realized that's why i became an android investor i wanted to aid their dreams and wanted their efforts and their dreams to be realized easier than mine even until now many people ask me do you regret selling joyo.com and determinedly i answered no after saying this very few people can understand how painful it is for an entrepreneur to sell his own business three years ago i went to seattle and visited and when we met he told me that sorry i didn't take good care of your joyous.com at that moment i feel so much pain in my heart and the third big change to me was in 2016. in 2016 xiaomi encountered a great challenge sales of xiaomi's smartphone drops drastically and also the reputation of the company was also declining at that desperate moment we decided that i will be in charge of the smartphone business of xiaomi at that time i always got off work after 12 o'clock pm this is why it is so influential to me think about it as a person with background from software and computer and i had to be in charge of a hardware department there there were a lot of makeup i have to do so on one hand i had to learn on the other hand i had to urge the whole team to learn for we started with just 100 people and step by step we come to today so in the past five years i always talk about making up things you don't know we have to know what you're capable of and you have to know the gap between us and the bigger companies in the world but i am sure that we can always learn and we can always do it as long as we want to do it we will be able to do it in five years when the sales of xiaomi smartphones went back to top three in the world do you know how excited i was we have already had a powerful engineer team and i believe this team will become stronger and they will develop better products in the future therefore in the speech on the 11th august last year we mentioned three rules in xiaomi technology is the foundation and we have to have the honest price and we have to develop the coolest products we believe xiaomi will present more better product to all the me fans who have supported xiaomi along the journey and you will see we became more become more successful on the journey of technology i feel that i can be called a preliminary expert on hardware and more and more i know how difficult it is to develop hardware but i still believe the integration of hard end software should be even 10 times more difficult than just focusing on hardware or software therefore i became an investor and from the software industry i came to the hardware industry all these are radical transformations of my life all these major changes in my life some of them are forced upon me some of them are choices i made but when i recall no matter what kind of change change it is it always needs courage strong will as well as strong ability to learn as well as the resilience to overcome the pain after all when you are getting into a new world the reputation the pride your network and your knowledge in the past will be gone the only thing you can rely on is nothing but a heart that wants to move on that wants to move forward i thank all those tests and pains without those tasks and pains i won't become the person i am today constant changes constant transformation can will only give you a more interesting life therefore i grow the habit of jogging recently i like to draw under the sunlight to feel the beauty of life and welcome the challenges in my life in the past two and a half months it was a difficult time for me because we will welcome another transformation i met with elon musk twice that year i also became an owner of tesla and i started to pay attention to the electrical vehicle business i always emphasize on the importance of electrical vehicles in the past seven to eight years i invested in 10 ev companies to be honest car manufacturing is a popular topic and during the executive meeting of xiaomi we also had several rounds of discussion on it back then our topic is to make up for the deficiencies and lay a solid foundation and we want to fully understand the hardwares so back then we are wholly dedicated to our core business on the 15th january this year the board of directors suggests us to learn about the perspective of electrical vehicle at first i want to say no to it because we invest five years to develop our smartphone business and we have gone through so many difficulties and finally we became number three in the world and we haven't finished the wall in the smartphone business the electrical vehicle business become a distraction so facing the trend of the time how should xiaomi make its own choice no matter how reluctant i am on the 15th january this year we started our investigation in car manufacturing i heard suggestions from many friends a large group of friends urged me to start the manufacturing of cars or even ask why do you think i can manufacture cars they say that xiaomi has been an expert on hardware and internet and there is no reason for you not to cr not to manufacture vehicles they also say think about it all your peers and competitors are manufacturing cars you don't want to miss the opportunity and i told them i also need to develop smartphones the wall of smartphones has not finished but they told me think about it maybe smartphones and electrical vehicles are the same thing think about the ecosystem and i said maybe this needs some imagination and during this investigation i also heard some interesting ideas some say the smart electrical vehicle is like a smartphone with with four doors so finally i find the connection between smart vehicle and smartphones and also there are many people who who told me not to do this and they have clear reasons and they are also out of kind well they say the car industry is a sophisticated and complicated industry with huge investment in it you always have to invest 10 or hundreds of billions of chinese us dollar to it and you can easily fail in it you are not an expert on it it is very easy for you to fail also people say your peers have been developing smart vehicles for five or six years maybe it is too late for you to start this business at this moment so now you know the problem for me to do or not to do this is a question this is a very very important decision for me during the day i can come up with 100 reasons to do it but at night i can also come up with 100 reasons not to do it so this has been a difficult time for me there are a lot of faults on my mind i start to think when we get into the smartphone business when we start the business we had nothing all our competitors are tycoons in this industry after 10 years of hard efforts we still created at least all those all these achievements we made and now we are a fortune 500 company with 30 000 employees and we are much better than we were back 10 years what is my main concern i thought about it for a long time today are we still brave enough like we were 10 years ago are we still determined enough like 10 like we were 10 years ago and do we have enough energy and dedication like we had 10 years ago so this is my main concern as i think about it my me fans gave me the biggest support the strongest support i still remember at the end of last year we had an activity called the new year wish of laging i said i will fulfill the new year wish of three me fans the id of one me fan is called pirate of the caribbean he says he wants to drive the trailer of xiaomi which is decorated by the xiaomi smart home products and he wants to travel around the world and i said yes because i thought this is a great idea and the whole engineer team worked for three months and they developed these products i never thought the first vehicle produced by xiaomi could be a motor home i think many many fans are also fans of vehicles i've been thinking as long as me fans want it we need to develop it and produce it before the spring festival we have another activity with me fans we invited some representatives from me fans and we had a spring festival feast it took us some time because they did feel a lot about xiaomi and one me fan even shed tears and i was awkward at that moment but overall speaking we learned a lot and we were moved by them one thing is that a me fan gave me a gift this is the gift a book i also bring this book to today's launch events this is the book it's quite thick so this book includes the orders made by this me fan in the past six years in past six years he spent 350 000 rmb on xiaomi products what really touched me is not the amount of money he spent is what he said to me when he gave me this book his name is and this is what truly touched me he said i always believed there has been a lot of buzz about the electric vehicles of xiaomi my friends tells me that he is also very interested in our vehicles that's a friend of mine and he told me as long as xiaomi makes cars he buys it yesterday at the product lunch but i wasn't feeling very well and the product lunch on it is extended to today that's unexpected and unfortunately he had to fly back to shanghai this morning because he already had a flight to get bought but he changed his flight ticket and got another day off from work and he is here today as well could you please stand up so we saw you wave to the camera thank you for coming i am truly moved they tell me as long as i dare to make things they buy the things we make a lot of people have been expecting cars from xiaomi and before the product launch we did a survey on the weibo account i think around 20 000 people participated and 92 people said they will buy xiaomi cars when they are launched i don't know how to repay the trust given to me i've been wondering why do people want us to make cars and why do people think we can definitely make good cars what do you think i really thought hard about these questions and i think i found an answer in the past 11 years xiaomi has launched so many products so people believe that xiaomi can make a car that impressive right and people believe that xiaomi already has the most complete smart ecosystem and with the support of me fans from across the globe as long as they make things they will be sowed right ceo of xiaomi i have been thinking how i can live up to the expectations of so many i know the risks that this endeavor entails and also know that the investment is at least tens of billions and it won't see any results in the next few years at the same time i know xiaomi as a different company from the small startup 10 years ago that had only three to five people today we have accumulated a lot of wisdom and experience and it is time for us to try the waters what do we have we have money more importantly we have over 10 000 people in rnd and we will add another 5 000. to the r d team we have a top-notch rnd group we also have the smartphone business that ranks across the world as top three smartphone company and we have the most complete smart ecosystem in the world truth be told we also can afford to lose the figure on this grain is 108 billion rmb is that cash reserve of sami group by the end of 2020. that was published in the financial statement of hours for the year of 2020 and with that amount of the cash reserve if we don't still try and we would be disappointing our me fans in the past 75 days we had 85 visits and we had in-depth exchanges and communications with senior experts in automotive industry with over 200 on experts and we had four internal managerial discussions and two formal board meetings and um in the past three to four months that there has been a lot of rumors because how active we have been on and finally the most division of xiaomi group is here enters the smart electric automotive industry that's a decision made by the board today that's the announcement that we would like to make today you probably already seen this announcement it's short and brief that it contains a lot of information we will invest 10 billion us dollars in 10 years in other words the managerial team can mobilize the 10 billion us dollars for the smart ev industry we have xiaomi group so that's our dedication 10 billion us dollars and that's going to be the registered capital of this subsidiary do you understand this is just the capital that we commit to and that's the cash reserve of the xiaomi group which will be used for in the smart ev and perhaps what it didn't notice for a better and more comprehensive smart ecosystem for our main fails we decide that the subsidiary of the ev will be wholly funded by xiaomi group so it is a wholly owned subsidiary of the hours and i've received a lot of messages from my friends asking me whether they have a chance to invest in the subsidiary and actually in the past two months and a half a lot of investors and big names proposed great ideas to me about investment and after a lot of hard deliberations we decided that for smartphones and ecosystems we need them to be there a hundred percent should bring seamless experience for me fans [Music] and i will be the lead of this wholly owned subsidiary on smart ev i will be the ceo of the company and those are the three layers of information contained in that a brief yet informative announcement now you understand where our heart lies from smart devices to smart home to smart office and smart mobility with the power of technology xiaomi aims to provide me fans across the world with a full range of products that enables more beautiful tomorrow and a better life and that is the fire and passion that we have at our hearts and i really hope that one day there will be a xiaomi car on each and every street and i can hear xiaomi engines everywhere i go and i truly believe that each and every me fan immersed in happiness brought by xiaomi products today with premium smart ev we want global users to enjoy ubiquitous intelligence and smartness in life that is our true missionary and i decided to lead our new adventure and this will be the last entrepreneurship in my life i am deeply understand what this decision means to me i am willing to put all the stakes i have accumulated over the years and fight for selmy in the next five to ten years we will fight a heart battle and prepare everything that we can and with all the patience and dedication for this new journey of ours some what i want to say is since i made the decision i no longer care about pressure what i have in mind is whether xiaomi has a capacity to make products that truly impress and benefit our me fans actually we have confidence in that and for the ev industry we are a late comer without much experience but we have amazing learning capacity and we have such a fantastic team of engineers and we're willing to devote our energy and time for success and believe success would definitely come to sell me cars as long as you're willing to wait so long as you want to wait with us with patience we will do everything we can to deliver our promise and to deliver xiaomi eevees to your face okay
