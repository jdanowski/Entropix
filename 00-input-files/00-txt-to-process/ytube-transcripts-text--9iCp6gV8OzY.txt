[Music] from the forbidden city in beijing to the shadow of mount rushmore i fought for you i fought for your family i fought for our country above all i fought for america and all it stands for president trump was saying we're putting america's interests first and he understood from the very beginning that the whole thing was china china has created in my opinion it's the single greatest theft in the history of the world they have taken money and jobs and factories he was saying to china you're not going to take advantage of us anymore one of the most divisive presidents in history riding roughshod over conventions at home and abroad trump put angela merkel right on the spot started craning from topic to topic like a squirrel caught in traffic i mean he flipped furious in this final episode donald trump drives america towards a nuclear showdown we understood that if you go in small you've got to be prepared to go in all the way [Applause] i left pyongyang terrified that what we really risked was an accidental war he takes on china in a battle for global supremacy and tries to strike the deal of the century this is the affinity that trump has with authoritarian leaders xi jinping doesn't have term limits and i think trump envied that [Music] settle down guys you all right tell me when you're ready ready okay well i just had uh the opportunity to have an excellent conversation with president-elect trump two days after being elected donald trump met president obama for the customary handover we discussed a lot of different situations some wonderful and some difficulties we want to do everything we can to help you succeed because if you succeed then the country succeeds away from the cameras obama delivered a sobering message china wasn't the only problem in asia president obama said to trump he said you know the biggest foreign policy crisis you're going to face and you could face it right away is with north korea and so i took it really seriously because the obama administration their policy towards north korea was strategic patience which basically meant kick the can down the road i was concerned that yes that would be our first crisis and i was concerned that it could happen as early as the first week of the trump administration the new president put north korea right at the top of his agenda trump said how is it possible that previous presidents have not addressed this problem from eisenhower on down how is it possible that they allowed a country which still thinks it's at war with us which has developed nuclear weapons and ballistic missile capability to deliver those weapons to u.s cities and incinerate u.s cities and he said i will not pass this problem on to another president [Music] [Applause] [Music] north korea's leader the 32 year old kim jong-un had vowed to follow in the footsteps of his father and grandfather by pursuing a nuclear weapon that could destroy the imperialist power of america trump told his deputy national security adviser to start knocking heads together i went around the room and i said we've been doing the same carrots and the same sticks we threaten north korea with economic ruin and then they come to the negotiating table and we give up the sanctions and we reward them with carrots there's always been divisions and kind of uh difficulty in getting consensus within the u.s government on how to approach north korea so this policy process that kt started was really important i said here's what i want you to do i want you to think outside the box way outside the box on one hand i want you to just think through what would happen if the united states recognized north korea as a nuclear weapons state on the other hand what would happen if the united states took military action against north korea or regime change it was really the first and last normal policy process on any foreign policy issue in this administration that i [Music] saw just six weeks after trump was sworn in north korea put on a show of strength when it launched four ballistic missiles into the sea of japan mcfarland took the findings of her report to her boss what the work revealed on north korea was that hey we just couldn't afford to to repeat the failed pattern of previous efforts to get north korea to denuclearize so we pulled together i would say was like taking threads economic political military cyber covert overt and it was instead of saying we're going to do a carrot and a stick on off switch it was going to be a dial where we would constantly up the ante make things a little tougher across all of those platforms until the until the north koreans came to the negotiating table we brought to the president options for a strategy that became known as maximum pressure and this was really based on the premise that the united states and its allies and partners could convince kim jong-un the kim family regime you know that that they're safer without nuclear weapons than they are with nuclear weapons but there was a problem the vast majority of north korean trade crossed its border with china trump would need chinese support to really dial up the pressure on kim but the president had done little to win friends in beijing we can't continue to allow china to rape our country and that's what they're doing it's the greatest theft in the history of the world they're building a massive military fortress in the middle of the south china sea that they're not allowed to do they take our money they take our jobs and we owe them 1.6 trillion dollars it's like how does that happen trump hoped to make a breakthrough on north korea when he invited the chinese president to his florida resort of mar-a-lago president xi said that there's a thousand reasons to have a good relationship with the u.s and not the single reason to have a bad relationship that's why president xi took all the trouble to fly all the pacific ocean travel to florida to malaga to meet president trump it was clear to me that the president was investing and invested in his relationship with she i think it was more important that he had the ability to call she and talk to him on the phone afterwards then to try and get a specific agreement done in mar-a-lago trump turned to his family to break the ice i remember very well president trump's granddaughter singing chinese songs was really amazing surprised and that was really something very impressive the staff was on the other side of the doors so we could peer in and see what was going on and we could see it was a good warm moment [Music] once the pleasantries were over the two sides got to work on the thorny issues of trade and north korea what we decided is to convince the chinese leadership that the threat from north korea is not just an you know a intercontinental ballistic missile aimed at seattle washington it's it's also the threat that the non-proliferation regime breaks down in northeast asia and across asia how long before japan has a discussion about getting a nuclear weapon or south korea you know or taiwan or vietnam that's not china's interest in the u.s there was a widely accepted misperception that north korea is china's problem and if china wants china can stop the north korean nuclear program but from china's perspective of course that's not correct north korea want to develop their nuclear technology because they feel insecure and who caused that sense of insecurity i think that's the u.s we've had a long discussion already and so far i have gotten nothing absolutely nothing but we have developed a friendship i can see that and i think long term we're going to have a very very great relationship and i look very much forward to it behind the scenes they were beginning to make some progress we were willing to press north korea to some extent try to impose some sanctions and try to force them to to talk to negotiate with the united states china can help can try to facilitate the dialogue but china cannot solve the issue for the united states i said look you have a tremendous power because of trading through the border and i can tell you china will do much better on trade if they help us with north korea she's willingness to help would soon be put to the test three months later north korea launched its first intercontinental ballistic missile over the pacific [Music] the u.n security council voted on a resolution to implement massive sanctions on north korea's key industries china backed the move [Music] but rather than bring the north koreans to the negotiating table the sanctions ratcheted up the tensions even further north korea best not make any more threats to the united states they will be met with fire and fury the likes of which this world has never seen before the president making the ominous comments from his golf club in bedminster [Applause] those of us who've worked on north korea are more acutely aware of how little we know about how they might react to some things and we were worried that this was really going to be a setback for our diplomacy [Music] secretary of state rex tillerson was on a trip to asia when his president threatened nuclear war when rex tillerson heard the fire and fury comments he was very unhappy it was pretty hard to be secretary of state for president trump um because it's very hard to have a profile of your own separate from the president and he was grappling with that on the trip mr secretary is this part of a diplomatic strategy what the president is doing is sending a strong message to north korea in language that kim jong-un would understand within weeks north korea's military carried out another test claiming they had miniaturized a nuclear weapon [Music] kim could now boast that he was ready to strike america as trump arrived at the un general assembly nuclear war had rarely felt so close the united states has great strength and patience but if it is forced to defend itself or its allies we will have no choice but to totally destroy north korea rocket man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime [Applause] [Music] north korea's foreign minister was watching it afterwards he went to see the un secretary general and his top conflict prevention official jeff feltman also attending was north korea's ambassador to the un ambassador ja crossed over to my side of the table and basically grabbed me by the arm and pulled me out of the room and once we were outside ambassador josh said to the former so this is jeff feltman and the foreign minister turned to me and said we would like to invite you to pyongyang for policy dialogue what do we do with this invitation there had been no u.n political talks in pyongyang with the north koreans since february 2010. the mood in the security council was pressure pressure pressure to take up the invitation feltman would need to get sign off from the key players at the un he knew the americans would be the hardest to persuade jeff feltman came to see me and i said you know jeff uh we really don't want the un to be getting involved and distracting the north koreans at this point we've built up this maximum pressure campaign we want them to be focused on us susan said look things are so serious right now the last thing we need is some sort of theatrics from you jeff felt when going to pyongyang um and being instrumentalized by the north koreans making have the north koreans look like everything's fine the u.n has shown up everything's fine we've seen this before with the north koreans where they get multiple things going and they play parties off one another so i went back to new york and secretary general said well let's just not answer the north koreans right now let's just wait let's not say anything on a visit to beijing tillerson let slip he was exploring his own talks with the north koreans only to be slapped down trump appeared to undermine a new diplomatic channel announced just yesterday by the secretary of state i told rex tillerson he's wasting his time trying to negotiate with little rocket man save your energy wrecks will do what has to be done the president's going to the president is going to communicate the way he communicates my job as chief diplomat is to ensure that the north koreans know we keep our channels open i'm listening our diplomatic efforts will continue until that first bomb drops my job is to never have a reason for the first bomb to drop the policy at the time was you know to to forego attempts to initiate a dialogue until there was real pressure but you know if you're the state department you do diplomacy i mean you can't help yourself right that's what you do a few weeks later the un secretary general antonio guterres visited the white house they were comparing notes on what was happening what might be possible how dangerous was it you know how likely would military with a military response b all that sort of thing and secretary general guterres said to president trump jeff feltman has this you know strange invitation to go to pyongyang and lead a policy dialogue with north koreans and trump leaned leaned over toward him and said jeff feltman should go to pyongyang and jeff feltman should tell the north koreans i'm willing to sit down with kim jong-un it was an extraordinary u-turn for a president who had just told his secretary of state that diplomacy was a waste of time the plan would be kept under wraps in public the mantra remained maximum pressure the u.s navy started moving warships towards the korean peninsula [Applause] we were going through this as a exercise just for the entertainment of it we understood it at the department of defense if you go in small you've got to be prepared to go in all the way certainly all the estimates were that that a war with north korea would be extremely costly not only for the united states but but more to the point south korea [Music] on route to his first summit in beijing trump stopped off in south korea 30 000 u.s troops stationed there had been conducting joint exercises with their south korean allies for decades they were now on high alert i just wanted to thank general brooks and everybody that is working with us so hard on the situation in north carolina [Music] the chinese government was playing a crucial role in putting the pressure on north korea but the hard line is on trump's team argued it was now time to get tough with president xi on trade there was really a tug of war between two groups one was that what i call the the panda huggers a lot of them were from wall street they had grown rich on trade with china and they envisioned the relationship with china to be very much the same it would be don't rock the boat keep u.s china trade right where it is and then there were the china hawks the china hawks said if we continue with the relationship as it has been the united states will over time no longer be the most powerful economic political diplomatic country in the world that we will cede that place to china [Music] the chinese rolled out what they called a state visit plus and trump became the first foreign leader ever to be given the honor of a dinner inside the forbidden city [Music] it was interesting the way that president xi was using history to send a message that china has taken center stage and here is a u.s president coming to visit beijing china is over you know what its leaders refer to as the century of humiliation and is now taking its rightful place in the world you are having fun yes sir that's something i'm we're having a great time mr president thank you very much it's an honor to be with you the hosting of the military parade this morning was magnificent and the world was watching when the agenda moved to trade the president gave the floor to one of his top china hawks i said listen you have to see the way this looks to us i thought as the president did that we had a very unbalanced unfair relationship the nature of their system is one of state-controlled capitalism and they were using the power of the state to help win the competition what we have to do is figure out a way to deal with it so that we're not the people paying the tab and so that we're treated fairly the united states really has to change its policies because they've gotten so far behind on trade with china for now the president could only push things so far he still needed china's help our meeting this morning was excellent discussing north korea as trump flew back to america jeff feltman was making his final preparations for the most important diplomatic mission of his life the dates were set by the the north koreans for early for early december and then on november 29th the north koreans launched an icbm and that they said was capable of reaching any part of the united states and declared that they had achieved the historic moment of completing their nuclear and rocket program [Music] a missile was launched a little while ago from north korea i will only tell you that we will take care of it it is a situation that we will handle i checked with the permanent missions again do we do we proceed with the trip or not given what just happened and in this case all of the missions said at this point go mr the major message i tried to get across this is a response to their arguments about the need for deterrence is that what they see as deterrence can provoke the very war that they believe they're deterring and they said we know that the u.s has absolute military power we know that the u.s could destroy us we know that our air defenses couldn't protect us from a sustained u.s strike so essentially when we know the us is about to strike because the us is going to go to war against us we're going to have to go first because that's our chance and and and i've said what if you're wrong you know i said to the north koreans they wouldn't know if they were accidentally stepping over a red line that would force some kind of military reaction from the united states you know i'm an american i do not know what trump's red lines are you certainly do not know what trump's red lines are their response invariably was our leader doesn't make a mistake our leader will know when the u.s is about to go to war the the our leader will know feltman was yet to deliver his message from trump he asked to speak to the foreign minister in private thank you very much i said president trump himself had asked to have me convey a message and that message was that he would be willing under the right conditions to sit down with kim jong-un there was a bit of silence before the foreign minister said you know i don't believe you why should i believe you and i said look i'm not asking you to believe me what i'm telling you is that the un was entrusted with a message from president trump i am the carrier of that message thank you i went to pyongyang deeply deeply concerned given this feeling that war was imminent i left pyongyang terrified that what we really risked was an accidental war kim's new year's address offered little [Applause] reassurances but kim did offer one surprise olive branch to america's ally south korea who would be hosting the winter olympics that year kim sent a 400 strong delegation to the games the buses from north korea rolled across the demilitarized zone on thursday morning that this is a really historic moment an important moment he even sent his sister kim yo-jong as his representative yes three weeks later yoon traveled to pyongyang on the first south korean delegation to meet kim jong-un since he came to power [Music] south korea's national security adviser rushed to the white house chung sat next to the president and we all just took spots around chung we summarized the meeting and then of course the punch line was and uh kim jong-un would like would like to meet you president responded quickly he said okay let's do it so so we were all uh you know uh stunned most of us thought that the time was not yet right that more work would need to be done to test north korea's bottom line uh before we would put the president in a room ambassador chung just about fell out of his chair because he thought he thought it was going to be you know kind of a hard sell i felt that it would be better to let to let uh pyongyang kim jong-un feel the pressure a little bit longer but of course the president wouldn't resist i don't think the opportunity and then the president said to chung young but hey and i want you to announce it i want you to announce it on on television south korea correct south korea is going to be making a major statement at about seven o'clock on what mr what on the big subject mr president on north korea or on trade okay on north korea or on training did you speak today with this nobel prize you will be nobel prize please no matter [Music] prices here we go guys good evening today i had the privilege of briefing president trump on my recent visit to pyongyang north korea president trump said he would meet kim jong-un to achieve permanent denuclearization thank you the summit that could define trump's presidency would be held in singapore to get there kim jong-un borrowed a plane from china entitled the apocal meeting that pioneered a new history between north korea and the united states the trip was a rare opportunity for kim to leave north korea and the young dictator made the most of it hiring the entire top floor of one of singapore's most exclusive hotels though he didn't order any room service for fear of being poisoned trump was also reveling in the moment he made sure the cameras were perfectly positioned to capture a meeting that he wanted to go down in history the leader of the free world president trump meeting face to face with one of the world's most brutal dictators president trump was very gracious he wanted to draw out kim uh to get a a measure of him and and a feel for his personality trump said you know i i can always tell with someone uh whether we're going to have a good relationship i can tell it in an instant trump obviously thought he had a new best friend in kim jong-un knowing kim was a hollywood movie buff trump tried to win round his new friend with a specially commissioned film it was an icebreaker to put an ipad in his hand hit play and to have this sort of uh uh you know movie preview trailer style uh video of of what's possible a new world can begin today one of friendship respect and good will where the doors of opportunity are ready to be open investment from around the world the future remains to be written but the north korean leader wasted little time before raising the controversial subject of u.s troops stationed in south korea kim jong-un as he had many times in the past complained about the big joint exercises between south korean and american forces which have been going on uh on the korean peninsula for about 60 years plus trump out of nowhere said i'm going to cancel the war games as he called them there's no need for them they're very expensive and it'll make you happy but i couldn't believe it the president's calculation was was a small give to see what what kim was willing to put on the table colleagues at the pentagon view viewed it very differently um because their job is to man train and equip and and plan and prepare for war i'm getting a text in in real time from my colleague matt pottinger and he said the president just uh canceled our exercises with south koreans this had not been previously planned we hadn't informed the south koreans and inform the japanese pompeo kelly and i were sitting there in the room with trump and we weren't consulted it came simply from trump's own mind it was an unforced error it was a concession for which we got nothing in return as the u.s military scrambled to inform allies in the region trump and kim put pen to paper on an agreement it promised further talks on nuclear disarmament but it was light on detail trump thought that u.s north korean relations were great because he and ken were buddies uh and it's a it's a very dangerous perception it's it's not to understate the importance of personal relations in foreign policy but the relationship between two leaders is not the same as the relationship between the two countries trump returned to washington triumphant claiming he'd averted nuclear war he was now ready to show what else his unique brand of diplomacy could deliver now that donald trump saw that he could get a meeting with kim jong-un on his own without the help of the chinese that kind of left his hand free to turn to this other issue that was lurking in the background all this time this major issue on trade president of china great guy i wanted to treat us better on trade that's my only problem last year we lost 500 billion dollars with china we can't do that anymore trump's china hawks had been urging the president to deliver on his promise to get tough on beijing this was their moment their system was one that was designed to build up china all of which is fine except the united states was paying the ticket for it i remember in one of those meetings ambassador lighthizer pulling out a chart and pointing to this this chart that looked like a steep staircase and it was a timeline and the the timeline was well here here's the the the the clinton administration's uh dialogue that they did for years with china and here's the bush administration's strategic and economic dialogue and here's president obama's dialogue and the backdrop to it was our trade deficit skyrocketing and lighthizer saying how many more dialogues are we going to do before we actually take matters into our own hands lighthizer wanted to impose sweeping new tariffs on china but some of trump's team had long feared that picking a fight with america's great rival would provoke a trade war with damaging consequences for the us gary cohn was chief among them there was an agreement that china was a bad actor when it came to trade the question then became how do you deal with that gary said let's go after china but let's develop a clear strategy if the us takes this step and put tariffs in place what's going to happen you know what are they going to retaliate on how is that going to impact the market people thought that the stock market would crash and the economy would go under recession to me tariffs aren't either good or bad right tariffs are just a tool the problem is the only thing the tariff was doing was acting as a consumption tax to the u.s consumer that bought that good from china what it comes down to is if it's an important problem and if you have to act you use the only thing you have which is access to your market president trump turning tough trade talk into action tariffs on 34 billion worth of chinese goods president trump's trade war with china just escalated in a big way tariffs on 200 billion dollars worth of goods made in china china is now punching back the biggest trade battle the u.s has been in since the great depression by the end of the year the tariffs had started to bite for both american and chinese exporters trump and xi met for dinner on the sidelines of the g20 summit the dinner began with a long portion of it taken up by flattery of trump by xi jinping and one of the points he made was you know you have too many elections in america it'd be it'd be much better if if you could stay longer and trump said well you know i hear people saying that maybe i should get a third term now the only people in america saying he should get a third term were himself and jared kushner this this is the affinity that trump has with authoritarian leaders xi jinping doesn't have term limits and i think trump envied that the chinese president suggested a way out of the trade war in return for the u.s lifting the tariffs china would buy more american agricultural products like corn and soybeans this would put money back in the pockets of the farmers whose votes would be crucial for trump's re-election xi jinping said in front of his other advisors that he was serious about winning a deal with the united states and he was serious about dealing with some of the core issues that we were raising on forced technology transfer on intellectual property we also talked about wanting to help u.s farmers and and and that signaled to the chinese side that it was time to stop messing around and actually engage and try to get to yes if you view the trade dispute from dignity perspective when they slam your your face you should slam back but if you view that from a strategic long-term perspective china needs stable bilateral relations with the u.s so president she made that decision that we need to sit down and scale down the problem with the united states try to cool the heat a temporary truce was agreed trump promised not to impose any further tariffs on china for now while his officials got to work on a trade deal trump traveled to vietnam for his make or break second date with kim jong-un [Music] in the year since their last summit the negotiating teams had made little progress as we drove over to the venue from what the secret service calls the beast the president's limousine trump was ruminating back and forth would it be better if i walked out or better if i agreed to a smaller deal i felt it was important for trump to understand that he didn't have to come away with the deal if we didn't get the deal that we wanted which was a commitment to complete denuclearization along the lines we wanted that he had to walk away from it north korea hadn't tested any more nuclear weapons but nor had they made any concrete offer to get rid of their program we stress that this is a historic opportunity that won't come again that uh our president is willing to do different things bold things and that he was 100 percent completely serious when he talked about transforming the us dprk relationship that he could see a brighter economic future for north korea that uh even you know from his background as a real estate developer he could see where those hotels were going to go on the north korean beaches and he was dead serious about it but if the north koreans miss this opportunity it wouldn't come around again kim's pitch focused on what he claimed was his country's most important nuclear site what kim was saying was we will give up the young beyond complex although he didn't really define that very carefully and in exchange you will lift the economic sanctions that the u.n security council had imposed on north korea it was utterly the opposite of the real commitment to total denuclearization give us young beyond means what give give us uh the two reactors and destroy them does it mean destroy all the various buildings and facilities on the site which are over a couple of hundred what do you mean give us young beyond and they were never ever really able to define that in the course of the back and forth as uh trump was looking for something better than the offer that the north koreans kept insisting he said maybe a lesser reduction in the sanctions can you do that and i i thought that was the most dangerous moment of the whole meeting because if kim had said yes i'll take a 50 reduction trump would have thumped the table and said deal and and it would have been a disaster the offer didn't come the secret service swept in and said uh we're pulling out early we're leaving i think our relationship is very strong but at this time we had some options and at this time we decided not to do any of the options sometimes you have to walk trump was so intent on making a deal but he understood that politically it would be very negative for him if he accepted what kim held out there it's the potential political blowback in the united states that he cares about and he finally said i just can't do this but it was in my view very very close the deal was dead but the bromance lived on president trump offered kim a lift home on air force one it was a gracious gesture the president knew that kim had arrived on a multi-day train ride through china into hanoi and the president said i can get you home in two hours if you want kim declined the collapse of the talks with kim was the last thing trump needed with the election clock ticking the pressure was now on to deliver a historic trade deal with china that he could sell on the campaign trail in april after months of negotiations robert lighthizer arrived in beijing expecting to finalize an agreement when lighthizer went to beijing he asked leo huh um you know you said you could accept a bunch of this text and leo said i can't do it anymore some of the more hard-line advisors in china thought that it would look like china was giving away too much um and not getting enough in return from from the united states you know china has suffered in the western powers in 18th century 19th century and there are many yuko treaties was was signed in the past so china doesn't want to repeat that the biggest sticking point was the u.s demand that china change its laws on how the two countries did business before the tariffs could be lifted to put all those atoms in the laws is not something we cannot accept but it needs time can the u.s assure us that they can pass a law in six months or three months i think they cannot when they sat back and they looked and they said holy cow this is like a real agreement like in you know you know like lawyers could write an agreement and we're taking on obligations and it's enforceable my guess is there was some digestion we had a deal that was very close and then they broke it they really did i mean more than just more than renegotiate they really broke it so we can't have that happen our people if they want they could buy from someplace else other than china or they can really the ideal is make their product in the usa that's what i really want yeah we're winning it you know what you want to know something do you want to know something we always win we always the gloves were off trump announced another huge increase in tariffs on 200 billion dollars of chinese goods and upped the ante by sanctioning some of china's most important companies including technology giant huawei the expansion of the trade war to huawei and other high-tech chinese companies for us are the vivid examples showing that the the us does not want china to to develop to surpass the u.s the u.s does not want china to dominate in advanced important industries like 5gs huawei and other chinese telecoms companies are not commercial entities they are arms of the chinese state this was the tip of a spear it was about getting your equipment into the most sensitive parts of a nation's critical infrastructure it would basically give china the keys to the kingdom the u.s always say it's not safe your security will be breached your privacy will be bridged but have we seen any smoking down here no no smoking gun meanwhile tensions had been escalating in the south china sea a vital international shipping lane u.s military aircraft alpha this is chinese rift china had 70 of the national islands leave immediately and keep far off to avoid enemies standing the biological relations was marching towards a deterioration that we have never imagined before so some people call it new the new cold war that summer pro-democracy protests broke out in hong kong world leaders would line up to condemn the chinese government's clampdown but with the u.s elections just over a year away and with nothing to show for his negotiations so far trump saw an opportunity for some peacemaking the president said the xi jinping looked this is your decision about hong kong after xi himself had raised it so it was giving xi jinping a green light in hong kong that i thought was very poorly advised when the two men met at the g20 in osaka trump again stunned his team this time over human rights abuses against uyghur muslims in north west china she had discussed the situation in xinjiang and trump said he approved of what the chinese policy was which was effectively to build concentration camps trump simply didn't see this as indicative of chinese attitudes and behavior that would affect us internationally trump seemed ready to go to remarkable lengths to get what he wanted the meeting really centered around the continuing effort to see if we could get the big trade deal what trump insisted on calling the deal of the century in the course of the conversation trump implied that the constraints on huawei and some of the other sanctions that had been imposed on chinese companies might be bargainable in the trade talks now it's true they involve trade issues but it was a very dangerous precedent to say that the american law enforcement system was on the bargaining table as election year began trump finally got an agreement with the chinese but it was far from the deal of the century he'd promised the u.s would ease tariffs and china would buy an extra 200 billion dollars of u.s products over the next two years but it wouldn't commit to some of the most important reforms the u.s had been pushing for we got used to the tactic that president trump used you can say brinkmanship or the maximum pressure he used that to make you believe that some serious conflict will happen if you don't change your your position but you understand that this is only a tactic and he he still wants a deal this is an unbelievable deal for the united states keeping these two giant and powerful nations together in harmony is so important for the world it's a very beautiful mosaic within weeks the deal would be eclipsed the day the deal was signed came just one day after the national security council staff had convened our first interagency meeting about this mysterious virus that had appeared in wuhan when i got home i started to dig through old files to find phone numbers for uh chinese physicians uh that i knew 17 years earlier when i had been a journalist covering the sars epidemic and what they told me scared me the president was given an emergency briefing the doctors said we believe that it's deadlier than the flu and it's just more contagious and i remember the president taking a pause and taking that in and i remember him actually saying huh so this is bad matt pottinger was saying i don't believe what the chinese are saying i think this is worse we should be preparing for it to come here the president says i don't want to go after the president of china we need to be doing our best to support these people soon the president would be forced to act one morning one of my contacts in china was on the line with me as i was driving into work and i said so is this going to be as bad as sars 2003 and the doctor said don't think stars 2003 this is 1918 think 1918. and uh when i got to the white house uh i reported this up to the national security adviser robert o'brien he said come with me and he pulled me in to the president's intel briefing and i joined a conversation there where we related to the president um what we knew the president said um would do you think we should cut off travel um uh robert o'brien and i said that we thought that was the right thing to do the president realizes if he doesn't want this crisis to become even greater then this is the first step that needs to happen four nationals who are deemed a risk barred from entering the country major u.s airlines suspending all flights to china as fears rise of a global pandemic any goodwill trump had been building with president xi was fast evaporating the ink wasn't dry on a great trade deal and all of a sudden the plague comes in from china we're not happy about it in the months that followed trump's handling of the pandemic would help seal the fate of his presidency but you notice the fake news now right all they talk about is kovit

major country in the world whose economy had grown in the last year the rivalry that trump had stoked was now closer to igniting did something no president had ever done before none of it ever really stood up to china and said this is not going to go on anymore and i want the united states to to to be number one in the world it is now and i want to say that way the view in china is the trump administration will not allow china to surpass the us the u.s can never be number two and china can never be number one we chinese of course believe we have that right and if the us if the americans believe we don't have that right we will definitely have conflicts and clashes [Music] we have the greatest country in the world we have the greatest economy in the world the future of this country has never been better so just a goodbye we love you we will be back in some form president trump was an unorthodox president an unorthodox style unorthodox and substance and it took this disruption
