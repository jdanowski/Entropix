[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] good morning guys last night was really incredible I just woke up in 2019 few more days this is day four let's go see you later all right here we go again and with a small hangover we start our day in the Pyongyang metro it is among the deepest metros in the world it can go as deep as 110 meters so it serves well as a bomb shelter its architecture is also really impressive and every station is decorated according the station's name with incredible Socialist Realist art it is of course no surprise that every station name somehow reflects the North Korean Revolution and about the price you don't have to worry you can get a one-way ticket for only five one that is less than 40 euro zone this makes it the cheapest metro in the world [Music] [Applause] [Music] the Metro has a total of two lines and 15 stops and I was happy that we could take the metro for six different stops first we took an old rolling stock from West Germany and later we took the new one that was according to my guide built in North Korea this one reminded me a lot about the one in Seoul so one fact about North Korea's metro line is that it was actually built five years before the first metro lines and Seoul and at that time North Korea had more money than South Korea the newspapers you see here are at every station for people to read while waiting and some people told me that Pyongyang's Metro looks a lot like the one in Moscow I haven't been there so I cannot compare myself now anyway when we arrived at our destination and noticed there were lots of young people at this place and I wasn't sure what they were going to do but they seemed to enjoy their time and when we were back up you can see the arc of triumph where I have been before an episode - luckily this time we had some time to kill because there were many school children playing on the square and from what I understood is that each class had to repair its own game my name is Bart [Music] either neem oil time tone young sunshiny Maria easily de Sousa name yep oh oh oh no more Monica Oh yogi oh no liar to move to me that to move to me that I'll see you soon me that yeah a little bit just a little bit yeah he goes away Oh Joseph ugh Jos Amala what the Gabe young since I named it anymore [Music] giorgia no sir here to Candida bye-bye so after some fun time with the kids we went to our next up the juju Tower this tower is named after the juju ideology an ideology that was introduced by the North Korea's first leader kim ill sung it commemorates kim il-song 70th birthday as it has 25,550 blocks 365 times seventy so that is one block for each day of Kim il-sung's life and ideas many buildings in Pyongyang have a numeric symbolism [Music] it is family and that is enough Kim Jong Ilya for me I'm not a big fan of flowers so let's quickly go to the next double the monument to party founding this monument is full of symbolism the hammer stands for the workers the sickle for the farmers and the brush for the intellectuals the whole monument is 50 meters high symbolizing the 50-year anniversary of the Workers Party of Korea so after short visit at this monument it was time for lunch in an area code to the ohm young new town this Street was built in less than a year and every building is for specific kind of people the blue building for example is for musicians and teachers and the lunch we had here was definitely one of my favorites so Camilla so after intensive program it was time to blow off some steam at the moon soo mole naughty chunk a big water park in Pyongyang and instead of swimming I decided to go to the barbershop [Music] welcome to the guitar like a man whoa Smits away from around the shop Madeline after one hour and a barbershop a nice shape and a head and shoulder massage I was satisfied with the new belt look and remember that while I was being shaved a North Korean man also wanted a haircut but he was sent away because they didn't want to mix the North Koreans with the foreigners and this barbershop that was a little bit weird I think anyway I still had time to quickly look around at the swimming pool that was surprisingly busy with North Koreans enjoying their time [Music] [Music] all right and now it's time to move out of Pyongyang again towards gasm the old capital of Korea during the Chorio dynasty a nun our way we stopped by the arc of reunification under reunification highway this highway goes straight from Pyongyang to the DMZ Panama John the sculpture symbolizes the north and south within the middle of the unified map of Korea so because it was already late we went straight to our hotel which was of a different quality than the one in Pyongyang here it was pretty much gold everywhere inside and in the morning all people of our group could use hot water for just an hour at the same time so I decided to walk around to give you an impression of how it looks like [Music] hey guys so we just arrived at Kaesong city which is the old capital of Korea tomorrow is the last day already we're going to Panama John border area which I have been already but on the South Korean side so there's going to be the only different experience before that we're going to explore a guess on and then we going back to Pyongyang anyway thanks for watching and let me know in the video below what you think and then I'll see you in the next video adios [Applause]
