I’M TELLING YOU, BULLET TRAIN. NOW, THIS. A NORTH KOREA DEFACTOR   SAYS ATTENDING A WOKE IVY LEAGUE SCHOOL HERE IN AMERICA REMINDED HER OF THE OPPRESSIVE REGIME OF KIM JONG-UN AND SHE JOINS ME NOW WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM. IT REALLY IS GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US. I WANT YOU TO TELL OUR VIEWERS WHO HAVE NOT YET HEARD YOUR STORY, TELL US WHAT HAPPENED WHEN YOU WENT TO A WOKE UNIVERSITY IN THE UNITED STATES. WHAT HAPPENED? >>  THANK YOU, MR. "VARNEY", FOR HAVING ME ON YOUR SHOW. SO FIRST THING THAT MY MOM TOLD ME WHEN I WAS GROWING UP IN NORTH KOREA WAS THEY COULDN’T HEAR ME AND SHE TOLD ME THAT THE MORE THAT I HAD IN MY BODY WAS MY TIME AND IF I SAID A WRONG THING, ACTUALLY THE THREE MEMBERS OF MY FAMILY COULD BE EXECUTED FOR THE CRIME THAT I COMMIT. GOING TO COLUMBIA I NEVER IMAGINED GOING TO A HIGHER EDUCATION PLACE, I THOUGHT IT WAS A PLACE WHERE YOU ARE SEARCHING FOR THE TRUTH AND WE DEBATE IDEAS AND INSTEAD OF THE NAME OF SAFE PLACE, THEY TOLD ME, YOU KNOW, IF THIS TRIGGERS YOU, DON’T EVEN COME TO THE CLASS, AND DON’T EVEN DO THE READINGS. INSTEAD OF TELLING THE REAL-WORLD, ACTUALLY THE REAL-WORLD DOESN’T WORK THIS WAY BUT THEY SAID IF THIS TRIGGERS YOU DON’T COME, AND I’M NOT BEING EXPOSED TO ANY TRUTH AND IF YOU’RE TO SAY THE WRONG THING THE PROFESSORS WERE TELLING ME YOU’RE BRAINWASH ED AND EVENTUALLY, I HAD TO SHOW UP UP SO I CAN GET A GOOD GPAND A GRADUATE FROM THE COLLEGE. STUART: HOW ARE THE OTHER STUDENTS RESPONDING TO THE KIND OF LECTURES AND TALKS THAT YOU WERE HEARING? WHAT WERE THE OTHER STUDENTS DOING? >>  THIS IS THE MOST SURREAL THING, RIGHT? PEOPLE WERE ASKING, OH, IN NORTH KOREA HOW WAS IT, HOW MANY PEOPLE BELIEVED IN THE PROPAGANDA AND I’M SAYING WELL IT WAS MORE LIKE LIVING A TRUE MAN’S SHOW NOBODY KNOWS WHO IS ACTING, RIGHT? AND EVERYBODY HAS TO SURVIVE AND AT COLUMBIA THE SAME THING. EVERYBODY JUST HAS TO ECHO WHATEVER THE PROFESSORS OR OTHER PEOPLE ARE SAYING SO NOBODY ACTUALLY IS SPEAKING OUT AND I WAS THE ONLY ONE RAISING MY HAND, LIKE I HAVE NO PROBLEM STUDYING WESTERN CIVILIZATION, I HAVE NO PROBLEM STUDYING THIS SUBJECT AND THEY WERE LIKE LOOKING AT ME AS IF I’M AN ALIEN AND THE FACT THAT I REFUSED TO HATE WHITE MEN, AND THEY WERE LIKE, YOU KNOW, YOU ARE SO SYSTEMICALLY BRAINWASHED. STUART: GOOD LORD. NOW, YOU’VE COME OUT WITH THIS STORY, I BELIEVE YOU’VE WRITTEN A BOOK ABOUT IT. YOU’RE WITH SHAWN HANNITY LAST NIGHT, ON FOX EARLIER THIS MORNING AND YOU’VE COME OUT IN PUBLIC, MAKING YOUR STATEMENTS. WHAT’S BEEN THE REACTION TO YOU? IS THERE SOMETHING LIKE A BACKLASH TO YOU? >>  WELL A LOT OF SO MUCH "F-YOU " AND LIKE THE MARXIST HAS BEEN THE BIGGEST TARGET FOR ME, BECAUSE NORTH KOREA IS THE ONLY COUNTRY THAT HOLDS IDEOLOGICAL SOCIALISM AND IT’S LITERALLY CALLED A SOCIALIST PARADISE, SO THIS IS SOMEONE FROM NORTH KOREA NOW POINTING OUT WHAT THEY ARE DOING TO THIS COUNTRY IS A SIMILAR THING. I REMEMBER IN NORTH KOREA WHEN I WAS BORN, MY FATE WAS DETERMINED BECAUSE IT WAS MIGRATE GREAT GRANDFATHER DID AND COMING TO AMERICA, TALKING TO A WHITE KID IT’S LIKE YOU ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SLAVERY THAT HAPPENED HUNDREDS OF YEARS AGO, RIGHT? LIKE THAT’S THE ONE THING THAT YOU CANNOT CHANGE AS A HUMAN BEING. NOBODY CHOOSES YOUR ANCESTORS. STUART: TRUE. LOOK, IT’S GREAT TO HAVE YOU IN AMERICA. IT’S GREAT TO HAVE YOU ON THIS PROGRAM. YOU’RE A SHINING BEACON OF TRUTH AND WE REALLY LIKE THAT YOU CAN COME BACK ANYTIME YOU LIKE. THANKS FOR BEING HERE TODAY, SEE YOU AGAIN SOON.
