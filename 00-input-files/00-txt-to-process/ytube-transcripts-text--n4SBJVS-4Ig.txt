so i understand that um things would be very different between people were you able to really uh establish trust between uh people that you knew outside of your family perhaps and talk about things that the the government may not want you to or was that something that didn't really happen but that is totally different because in north korea we have to respect these family members him kim jong-il and because they are leader and you know there is in here is the democratic countries and the people never some people don't care about their leaders or some people you know always say that it's about the language to the leaders but in north korea they will have funders so in our home and in companies of course everywhere in train both station everywhere so we put the game results portrait you know pictures and so you know at home is the same we not to put the family pictures we put on this his pictures and then every morning we say that thank you to him but we never seen we never met to him but people have believed thank you thank you father thank you father we said that yeah so it you didn't really experience much in the way of conversation that went against party lines with other people really that didn't really happen um very much we live it because it's north korea's yeah north korea has only one party is the korean workers party so people wanted to join this party because in north korea we have about two different lives so one is our normal life but that is individual life is very important in outside countries but in north korea never care about the individual lives they only care about the political life that is really important so kim il-sung said that is if your politics is the physical bodies died and that is gone but your political bodies still live us divided to us so this means politics is really important but in north korea not many people they join the party is themselves because they is north korea as we divided different classifications inside north korea so this classification is the biggest we divided the three and then inside the divided pivot one is different categories so big big this speaking is a three classification words first is elite classification so a little classification this means who joined the gamers songs with the chemistry in 1930s area or who joined the 1950 korean wars or something not so that is elite people and middle class that is not important to middle classes yeah and also third one is hostile classes so hostile meaning is who who was rich in 1930s in japanese eras or who families escaped north korea in 1950 korean wars or who family remembers in south korea relatives in south korea so that's thus family remembers all hostile classes so day life is always underground and they never join the work party i was actually going to ask you about the uh the classes because um we generally refer to them as core wavering and hostile but i think you use some different names there but um what was your class did you know what it was um whilst you were in north korea oh my brother classification was the elite family elite classification but my mother was a hostile because my grandfather left north korea in 1950s okay so you you kind of had a weird combination there where you had both the kind of the highest and the lowest there because of course the hostile class um goes for a lot more hardship than perhaps the others yeah but his normal life is not matter because our surname is park so followed by father's classifications but when we 17 we graduated a high school and then we chose university or job something that and then they take the old background so that's time it should be really hard because my mother was hostile background okay so i want to move on to the the famine of the 1990s and i understand that this was what motivated you to leave originally and was it um was the the famine purely the motivation did you have any concept of freedom or was it just that you wanted to find food oh we never heard that it's a pretty last world cup when i lived in north korea so nowadays many uh korean experts or researchers say that is a farming start in 1996 to 1998 but my experience the burmese started the early 1990s yeah because yeah because it's you know that is a former soviet union it's flaps down in early 1990s and many socialist countries cropped down in late 1980s so north korea really had financial problems and economics a lot of problems so that's why i started early 1990s north korean government stopped our pools so people started hunger this early 1990s yeah i think it came with the the 1991 collapse of the soviet union didn't it and i believe the soviet union gave food subsidies to north korea and when it collapsed that meant that um they were no longer able to distribute food in north korea that is that right i think so that's right what is a north korea or level teaching to us that is myself learning the outside because i want to learn because north korea never teaching to us is soviet unions clap down issues or some social recent countries collapsed down in eastern europe they labeled teaching talk to us so we didn't know and i didn't know that it's a german unification in 1989 it happened in 1989 but i didn't know when i lived in north korea because they never teaching to us so north korea started they said that is this output problem is always american problems okay not to said that this is socialism club stylist they always told us american problems so they they always blame the united states for all of the problems that people faced okay
