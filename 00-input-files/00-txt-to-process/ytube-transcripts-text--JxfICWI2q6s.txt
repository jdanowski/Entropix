nightfam i'm about to take you on a trip to north korea where we will have to follow the strictest travel rules on our planet first things first if you are from the usa south korea or malaysia it's gonna be really hard to take you this guy just doesn't like your countries unless we get you a special permission from both governments you will never see north korea with your eyes now assuming that all of you can make it we need to check our luggage wearing blue denim jeans piercings or makeup is bad but most importantly we cannot take the bible unless we want to be publicly executed as we're getting closer to the departure it's time to check our phones if they contain any songs photos or videos that go against their culture or the government we have to delete them before we even get to the airport and now finally that we are about to take off we have to be ready for an insane jet lag because once we land in north korea it won't be 2020 anymore on planet north korea the year is usage [Music] 109. 109 is the number of years since their founder kim il-sung came into the world because north koreans see their dictators like christians see jesus they started counting years from the first leader congrats we have finally landed now we are in north korea in this distant city our tour guide will be breathing down our necks all the time we have to forget about the joy of solo adventure we can't ever leave the hotel alone we can only visit sites and shops allowed by the government and we absolutely cannot take any photos without the tour guide's permission i'm not kidding we have to ask every single time this rule is so strict that if we take a wrong picture of museum galleries soldiers police or even poor people authorities can tag us in our tour guide as spies this strictness is quite depressing so how about we take a good tour to see some food well about that meals for tourists are usually controlled three meals a day is considered generous there is not much access to street food and the cuisine is not diverse at all unlike most of the countries there is no mcdonald's in every corner and just in case it matters to you condoms and tampons don't exist in north korea locals have somehow survived without them and speaking of the locals we should not talk to them we won't exactly get jailed for it but talking with a north korean person could make the government see us as spy so if we ever see a crowd of north koreans being loud and friendly with tourists there are hired actors on the streets who work to cheer up the travelers and show north korea in a positive light and we have to do some acting as well on our strict trip to north korea we are required to bow and lay flowers at the many monuments of all the dictators we can't point our fingers at the statues we can't joke about the leaders we can't say anything bad or we get arrested right on the spot and the show does not end here once we got back to the hotel after a long and quite depressing day big comrade could be watching our every move telephones fax machines television you name it they are all possibly wiretapped thank you for coming with me this was our one day on a controlled and strict trip to north korea but these and many more strict laws are the reality of over 25 million north koreans and that's why instead of going there and supporting the show it is better to stay home and together visit with this video because the trip to north korea is a perfectly crafted lie that we should never support
