ultimate power can corrupt that's the nature of power and when they just die to give their rights and power to government that is like what scares me the most and of course because they are not they are taking this for granted they don't know how hard it is to be free like literally i crossed the middle of goldberg desert to be free but the thing is what i did was nothing so many people fought harder than me and they didn't make it i was born in north korea in the end of 1993 and escaped when i was 13 years old and then went to china mongolia and south korea and i came to america so it was a long journey to be free when i was going to school in north korea like they were even in the math problems they would say you know there are four american masters you keep two of them then how many american ambassadors left to care that as like seven years old you say too like american bastard was one word for north koreans we were not allowed to call americans as like americans so i went to columbia university in 2016 and i transferred from south korean university uh i still remember at the at the orientation i loved books when i was in north korea his story was forgotten they don't tell us big bang or even the jesus christ or whatever the theory says how we came about as a humanity is not taught so when i was at school though you know i was excited about like learning about history and you know how the people thought back then and one of the person that organization was asking who was like loves jane austen and and who reads this classical books and i was like i love those books i said i thought it was a good thing right and then she was like did you know that those writers who had like clothing your mindset were racist and bigots wrote their books so they are subconsciously brainwashing you and that's like when i realized wow this is insane i'm like i literally thought i thought america was that different and i just saw so much similarity that i saw in north korea and i was started worrying about this country mainstream education is purposefully designed to not make resentments western democracy it's uh right like the things that i was learning in schools of polling right they tried to explain things from everything was all about white men and how they tried to overpower and you know like how white men destroyed the humanity right mao killed most people than on this human history he killed like 50 millions of chinese during the communist revolution and i mean he still was like like 60 million people but the kids don't understand and they still playing this fire with the ideology with the code like communism or socialism like colombia is all about safe place and a robot like not having hate speech and before every class it is the same thing like we go around and like tell us your pronoun and like english is my third language i learned it as an adult i can't i sometimes really like saying he or she by mistake not because i don't respect them but now they suddenly asked me to call them day and like how the heck do i incorporate in my sentences i just i literally thought it felt like uh the big rationing civilization you know and maybe even north korea is just not nuts right like i was like yeah north korea was pretty crazy but not as this crazy what shocking to me is that north korea we don't have internet we don't have access to shakespeare or like any of these great thinkers we don't know but here while having everything people choose to be brainwashed and they deny it that's like where i question like what it means to be a human being i still don't know education almost make you not to be able to think critically even though in the name of critical thinking that's what they do like i remember after my escape they told me like critical thinking is what does that mean and then they said like you know kim's who are dictators they go to bathroom and they were not starving and in north korea i literally believe that my dear leader was starving he's a fattest guy right how can anyone believe that and like somebody literally showed me a photo look at him like he's a fattest guy other people are all thin and he's like oh my god why did i not think that he like he was fat actually right because i never learned how to think critically so i think that is almost the exterior is happening in america people see things but still they just completely lost ability to think critically because i have seen oppression i know what it looks like when they go after okay this speech is a hate speech you're gonna like ban it but when it comes to deciding what is a hate speech it usually comes the government the north korea to the degree of controlling of people's thoughts that they they were purposefully removing the concepts like in love liberty human rights and i still remember when i got out in south korea when i saw this like celebrities were crying on tv and it was a fundraiser for like little puppies the animal shelter and it was like fighting for animals rights and i was like what do you mean animals have rights you know i didn't even not know i had the rights as a human being and this is a paradoxical world that we are living in these kids are literally just curing like eyes and keep saying how they're oppressed how much interest they experience and like they are like i mean daily they spend like almost half a million dollars to go to this school you know and like they are talking about like they are becoming a vegan and i'm like wow okay they are so bitter they have zero zero appreciation for what this country did what the constitution says to protect individual liberty they have zero zero zero appreciation they are dying to give all their liberty away it's like where are we going from here like i it's the future of our country is as big as north korea if you do not rise up right now literally we are going to distinguish there is no like rule of law no morality nothing is good and bad anymore so complete chaos and i guess that's what they want eventually they will destroy every single thing and then we build like comments you know paradise maybe i don't know to say why we are going towards
