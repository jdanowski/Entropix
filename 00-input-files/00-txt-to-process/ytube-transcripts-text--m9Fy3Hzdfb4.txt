[Music] a civilian plane diverted to imprison a critic of the regime a president who threatens to flood europe with drugs and migrants just where is alexander look schenko taking belarus well the exiled leader of the opposition says he's turning my country into the north korea of europe non-transparent unpredictable and dangerous this is round table [Music] very good to have a company i'm david foster so what good will new sanctions imposed by the european union actually do and how much support does lukashenko still have from the kremlin [Music] fighter jets were sent to intercept a ryanair flight from greece to lithuania after an alleged bomb threat and escorted it to the belarus capital minsk belarus was then accused of having hijacked the plane so that it could arrest an opposition activist roman protosavich and his partner sophia sapega ryan air chief executive michael o'leary described the incident as a premeditated and unlawful hijacking and an illegal and reprehensible action european union and uk leaders have agreed sanctions against belarus including banning its airlines from using the bloc's airspace and airports this is an attack on freedom of expression and this is an attack on european sovereignty and this outrageous behavior needs a strong answer therefore the european council decided that there will be additional sanctions on individuals that are involved in the hijacking but this time also on businesses and economic entities that are financing this regime president lukashenko of belarus has apparently now threatened to allow migrants and drugs into western europe if sanctions are imposed nine months after the protests against him began over allegations that he stole an election that kept him in power lukashenko is earning his reputation as europe's last dictator the opposition say the country is in danger of becoming europe's north korea are they right well let us welcome to this edition of round table out of vilnius in lithuania frank vietchalka senior advisor to the exiled belarusian opposition leader svetlana tikanovska we say hello to hannah yobakova journalist and fellow at the atlantic council and we travel to northern ireland to belfast where we see alexander titov lecturer in modern european history at queen's university belfast we welcome you all back to roundtable alex i'm going to come to you first of all since you are to some extent on the outside looking in how has lokashenko's position changed since the protests began it didn't go well for him uh as he expected he started his campaign in trying to uh play uh in some extent anti-russian card arresting um one of the presidential candidates which was a head of the bank owned by russia russian companies he was arrested several men on transit to ukraine which were russian mercenaries and then in the end he uh the scale of protests against you know obvious specifications of the of the results were such extent that he had to drop all his kind of pre-election plans and uh run uh to moscow as the only country which would still talk and support him so uh he is uh it was a huge shock to him uh biggest protests uh i think ever in in in belarus since then and um uh for a while for a few days it looks like he he might even fall but i think since then he has consolidated his position by uh so he's releasing strong amount of repression against their position but all that which seemed to be going well he again undermined by um diverting that plane um orion airplane which caused another level of uncertainty and um questions over his leadership again so can actually in a stronger position now than he was when the protests were at their height or whether you think he's now thrashing around because i know you other two believe that he's in a a weaker position than he was nine ten months ago is that a view you share alex i mean when they protest with uh you know you have almost uh several hundred thousand people in the middle of uh minsk and there seems to be powerless to do anything about them uh that was kind of his weakest point since then uh there's no mass protests against the position yes his credibility is severely uh undermined both internationally and inside belarus but he has preserved his control of the key elements of his power the security apparatus and the state operators and he's also can seem to continuously have the support of moscow so with those two things three things security state operators and moscow support he seems to be um in a relatively secure position for now okay so frank you first of all and then we'll play in a um a clip from svetlana tikanovska the opposition leader the opposition leader you work for um but your thoughts on why and i've read this in your notes why you think he's in a weaker position now when the protests on the streets have gone away and he's still there nine ten months after it all began i think he's in a much weaker position than he was he is losing the feeling of reality and this diversion of airplane this is actually the symptom of of his absolutely uh separation from the the reality on the ground lukachenko is losing loyalty among his own people among businessmen among uh nomenclature officials who supported him i'm asking you to give me exact examples of why he's losing uh his power base number of defectors number of defectors from uh police we can see one people a day joining by pool which is based in the worst of the organization of the fact of the factory is bad word of those who worked for the regime before elections in august also we can see the number of support for changes we see service on the ground made in belarus and we see more and more people who believe that there is a deep political crisis and the only solution uh is free presidential elections okay let's let's hear from zlatan uh takanovska now i call on the european parliament to make sure that the reaction of the international community is not limited to the iran air flight incident the response must address the situation in belarus in its entirety or we will all face such situations in the future as lukashenka is turning my country into a north korea of europe non-transparent unpredictable and dangerous so hannah isn't isn't that in a sense hyperbole there's no nuclear bomb in belarus whatever the president does is unlikely to affect the rest of the world very much at all what lukashenko is actually doing is affecting the rest of the world he is basically now is drawing a new aviation map of europe because flights well because um airlines had to ban uh their flights because what the governments of the respective countries said uh told them to do so um so flights are not kind of flying overboard belarus and bursting planes are prohibited from landing in european countries so it it's all going to bring some long-term effects obviously for europe for the world for the west and also for belarus and also financially people but these are minor inconveniences aren't they it depends what effect they they're going to bring because well if flights are being diverted many flights have been diverted this is going to affect the uh the economy as well both the belarusian economy but also the the european one right so this is not only about five or six flights being just um you know changing routes so um and people again reputationally lukashenki is becoming toxic not only for belarusians he is becoming uh not only an internal belarusian problem because he um there were eu passengers on the plane luka shenka is now a problem for the eu for the region for the continent and well let's see if not for the world and i think russians also understand that clearly that he is just too toxic for anyone well let me just throw this out there it was only a few days ago that he had a meeting with vladimir putin in the uh the resort town of sochi uh putin said that all this fuss about the the passenger jet was an outburst of emotion the two guys seemed fairly close to one another still what do you think putin's position is hannah i'll come to you on this one and then move to you alex on it what do you think putin's position is with regard to lukashenko he wants to maintain the status quo right when it comes to borus he's not a big fan of lukashenka but he doesn't want him to leave because there is no alternative so he would support him as long as it's needed though it's not really clear for me for how long putin is going to support lukashenko because this support is getting more and more expensive and i don't mean literally i mean reputation reputationally as well because well for the russian people and for the russian elites this is also not not very convenient but russia's already under sanctions um there are those who suggest it goes to various countries poisoning different people that it's quite happy to interfere in elections its reputation couldn't get much lower could it uh when it comes to well okay so there is the west right that is going to might increase pressure on russia and russian oligarchs on the russian authorities but there are also russian people who might not support putin's actions when he supports lukachenka so let's also take this into account and let's take into account the russian elites that might also raise questions about uh putin supporting lukashenka who is just okay i i get that i get that okay i'll ask you about that that response alex in just a moment but but your thoughts on the relationship between putin and lukashenko first of all um elections gave a very long interview to um ukrainian journalist golden and he talked in detail about his relationship with putin uh i think i agree there's not much kind of love lost between them uh lucas has been an extremely difficult partner for putin for many years so why stand by him sir well because there's no one else to do he's in control uh lukashenko is in control of belarus because he controls uh the security operator stated varieties uh there's no stronger position to topple him and uh and in a sense also there's a great asset for putin in lukashenka is because as you know as your piece implied that he actually uh is so toxic uh that almost anybody else would be much more uh acceptable in the west therefore uh location in many ways has nowhere else to go he looks so bad he makes everybody else look good well that's that's a rather strange way of looking at it if you happen to be the kremlin but frank seriously here um you work for the opposition leader she is in exile and the chances of her being invited back i mean are extremely small but the point that's been made on this program and on others indeed is that if the kremlin had somebody that he could trust to install instead of look at schenko it would do it's up to belarus people not kremlin to decide it's up to belarusian people to decide how long lukashenko will stay in power how elections will be held who will participate there i think we look uh too much at the russian side and the western politicians are very often they mix two problems problems of russia and problem of belarus if we will be able to separate and look at the belarus issue separately the revolution better is that as non-geopolitical but revolution for free elections for dignity for human rights it will be much easier to solve it of course russia is looking at belarus events as the possible scenario for russia and of course they don't want lukashenka to be changed by other leader is the result of revolution so they prepare in their own scenario the scenario which look like more acceptable to them and which will not create the domino effect in russia so they may want to install somebody that is more acceptable to them because they don't want to see the belarusian people vote in somebody who you might support so what hope does that give for svetlana ticonovska and others who might want to lead the opposition not much at all i would suggest our biggest hope is that everyone will will be back home all those in prisons let's not forget that more than 2 000 people are in jail and 450 are political prisoners and many dozens of dozens of thousands are in exile so we have to make sure all of them are back home and many of them will be able to participate in new elections and russia can play constructive role here we hope that the biden putin summit will open some new ways some new channels of communication and by them will explain putin that this revolution is not about geopolitics that even chihanovsky or any other leader who will come to power in belarus he will not turn belarus anywhere belarusians are pretty comfortable in being in the center of europe and staying neutral but the only thing they want the more percent freedom let's hear from the man we've been talking about alexander lokashenko and hannah then i'll come to you pregnant as we predicted our ill wishes from outside the country and from inside the country changed their methods of attack on the state they have crossed many red lines and have abandoned common sense and human morals this is not information warfare anymore this is a modern hybrid warfare we must do everything to prevent it from becoming a real war [Music] hannah where do you think he feels under attack because clearly that's what he's suggesting here i totally agree that he feels bad in a corner and that that he is actually weak we might not see much protest right now because people are scared because the level of fear and oppressions is just incredible it's just even dangerous to come out to the street just to walk downtown because well anybody can be detained can be arrested can be kidnapped nevertheless people are still resilient people haven't given up and people are trying to express discontent in any way possible i call it accumulated cumulative effect and that's very important because location can knows that this is not over the revolution is not over and people are still well against him they still oppose him right and you can see many many signs of this people are trying to self-organize in any way possible they have changed the format they are now protesting in their local neighborhoods they are holding white red white flags or but hannah this is what you told me three months ago that the protests had disappeared off the streets and gone underground but people were still uncomfortable in little local neighborhood groups i'm going to come to you alex if i may and and suggest that it's interesting to hear the hope that both frank and and hannah have but isn't it a little bit of a forlorn hope perhaps similar to that of the syrian opposition who many many years later and clearly with a great deal more bloodshed than we've seen in in belarus still have the same person in part because he's got the right friends lukashenko is not somebody who lived by his own accord and uh so he has to be forced for power and uh at the moment there doesn't seem to be any force able to do it uh to force him out uh since he uh literally suppressed all the protests uh and even if he is unpopular uh as we know we can see and wasn't popular before the elections i mean you need some kind of mass mobilization uh and it's just not uh happening at the moment so then to do it pressure from outside and the eu sanctions that well they they've surprised some people didn't they with the the speed with which they came in do you think they and um any other measures of um getting cracking down on lukashenko may have some bearing no i don't think so i mean there's certainly the sanctions which much more swifter and more widespread and i don't think we've seen the last week they're discussing about uh sanctions on various uh export sectors of belarusian economy but i mean you have to understand that lukashenka he is a man all about power he's not going to give up because he's a he there's some sanctions on flights or anything else he'll turn to the last and uh uh yes that would be much more difficult there'll be a worse economy he has more reliance on russia but ultimately what you want to be imprisoned himself or be uh empowered more in minsk uh even if it means he is completely isolated except for russia of course you choose to stay i see you nodding so my question going to be well i can ask you to sort of say what it is you agree with but i also want to ask you how do you go about as an exiled opposition in returning to the country and getting these elections that you so wish to see actually take place but give us your first point the the first will be about sanctions that of course lukashanka will not give uh give up power volunteerly but sectoral sanctions which were never imposed by european union will force him to do this if not him people around him because there are many many groups that were using their proximity to lukashenka to satisfy their own interest and right now they're unhappy if potash oil steel and wood industries will be sanctioned that will hit strong on people around lukashenko and on the second question i think we will be back home already the end of this year situation is developing very quickly the last week events the statements of burrell statements of biden about belarus shows that billers will be on the top of the agenda next weeks and next months and i'm pretty confident that belarus can be success story for europe and for democratic world so what do you see happening what do you see happening to lukashenko do you see an end like chauchesku's do you see him being offered a chance to leave the country going somewhere else uh if he does go do you see those people around him who become dissatisfied with him being happy to invite somebody like tikonovska back into the country how do you see it unfolding you you in a minute hannah but franek uh it can be churches it can be anukovic but it's up to him to decide if he wants to stay in history that the person who who is killing and murdering his own people it will be josh's scenario but he can run away as yanukovych as well or he can go to the dialect to make concessions conduct free elections and stay living in belarus as the first president so it's up to him but we have to put pressure in order to make these changes happening as soon as possible my goodness you think he could stay in power with the support of the belarusian people if he makes changes i think this could be the solution okay hannah i saw i saw you wanting to say something then opening your mouth and of course i had thrown that one at frank but um sorry to frank to cut you short but uh please hannah take up take up the story i would actually say that the reasons for discontent of the people is so kind of the list of reasons is so long so it's not really easy to satisfy people voters when they are so angry and that was visible before the elections when they traveled across the country and they talked to them and then there was this police violence police brutality and now the divisions in um kind of between those people who want him to go and those people who want him to stay are so huge this is about ethical values this is not only about luka shanka and you know taxes or or income or salaries whatever this is kind of the full list of reasons and he needs to kind of people have given up on him already right and that's why he needs to be thinking about um actually living his life but you believe as frank does get tell me if i'm right on this one that it will be the lack of support from those closest to him that proves most telling in the end that's what i was trying to say this is it doesn't matter whether this was the case three months ago or not but when he lost popular support it's really too expensive to maintain the status quo too expensive to pay security forces who would uh repress citizens yes his elites who see that there is no way back and people won't change would also kind of at some point uh think that well the change is needed alex what do you think could be done on top of what we've already seen in terms of pressure from the outside to make him either decide to hold these elections which frank would like to see or decide he's going to get on a plane not have it diverted and go somewhere that he likes well um i mean again i mean if you want to kind of look at external pressure you know obviously there are two sides uh the belarus squeezed between russia and the in the west uh and the more pressure of the west puts in it the more our uh support russia will provide diverting uh you know experts uh of potash or oil whatever by russian ports of going them to china and so forth so yes there would be costs and uh it would be costly but you know for us it's a kind of geopolitical game they don't want to have any unfriendly um leader uh in uh or remotely and friendly leader really who would for example would advocate uh neutrality and leaving the uh security pact which uh has with russia now um so they lost ukraine they don't want to lose belarus so they will stand to the end in that respect uh in terms of uh prussia well i mean it's really is simple as as if actual uh people uh who work on whom here a license for support security forces business people et cetera but they're not okay uh frank you said you hope that it might all change by the end of this year you said that to me this time last year no no i i last time i said that 2021 situation will change situation already has changed significantly we have absolutely new quality of the society but lukashenko is still there uh i think this is the matter of months but it depends on belarusian people right now but also on the international community the role of international community became much much bigger than last year last fall right now it's up to uh the western societies us uk uh european union to show deloresians positive alternative many belarusians were in underground right now they want to see for what they are fighting for they want to see the positive alternative and this comprehensive plan presented by brussels a few weeks ago this is exactly what belarusians want to see frank thank you very much indeed last word hannah if i can from you uh putin and biden meeting very very soon do you think that could prove to be pivotal um it might be it just uh depends obviously on them i think putin will kind of adopt his uh really old strategy of saying that it's up to belarusians to decide on the future and on the uh political crisis in the country but it's important that biden acknowledges that well agreements between location can put in will not be recognized they would be reconsidered um all kind of attempts of russian oligarchs to bible or since they don't enterprises should be also they might be either sanctions sanctioned or these agreements would not be recognized so it's really important to send such signals that it's just too expensive for russia to support mubashink it could well be that the rug is pulled very very gently out from underneath him by russia i don't know whether we've actually addressed the question of whether this is europe's uh north korea but we have looked at the future of belarus and i think the next few months as you've all pointed out could be pretty crucial indeed listen thank you very very much indeed frank hannah and alex and uh wherever you happen to be watching this edition of round table we of course thank you uh for tuning in do so next time if you can but for now for me david foster and the team we wish you farewell you
