[Music] time is slowly healing the raw grief of cindy warmbier this is it it's a cool day but the gaping hole left in her family will never be filled [Music] we wrote son brother and friend and that was just him everyone loved him absolutely everybody that met otto loved him it's such a big loss otto warmbier was the american student who became a porn in a game of international brinkmanship captured held and ultimately killed by a regime that his parents fred and cindy view as pure evil all i can say is otto was treated just like they treat the people he was a bargaining chip he was put in a brain dead condition from torture and they did nothing a year and three months later they released him and he it was horrendous the north koreans are horrible people the regime is horrible disgusting human beings criminals thugs there it's a criminal enterprise in a concentration camp otto warmbier grew up in the sleepy suburbs of cincinnati [Music] so proud tall and athletic he excelled at sport and studied business at an elite university this is our last day together as wilding high school's class of 2013. tomorrow morning we will all belong to another class another job or another city to his mum and dad he was the perfect son how proud were you of otto i i was really pr you know it's a firstborn what can i say everyone knows you have a special bond with the firstborn he was a standout at the end of 2015 otto had some spare time before taking up an internship on wall street so with the suggestion of one of his university professors 21 year old booked a five-day trip with a tour group to the world's most secretive state what do you think the world needs to know about north korea it's the scariest place in the world canadian sarah mclaughlin is a teacher but for five days in pyongyang she was one of otto warmbier's closest travel buddies she's never revealed the inside story of that trip until now the details inked in her journal we left saturday morning and otto was held back still trying to figure out why ready all right ready to throw it at me [Music] this is the last footage taken of otto before he was plunged into a nightmare looking back i definitely think that there was a plan and he was a part of it as the group was boarding its plane home otto found himself at the back of the line suddenly he was seized by guards and marched off we were trying to protest and not get on the plane yet to wait for otto and there was about three of us and uh the officers with with machine guns made us get on the plane i guess if a guy with a gun tells you you've got to get on the plane there's no arguing i've never experienced fear like that before everybody on the plane was just completely silent nobody wanted to leave and we had no choice north korea accused otto of trying to steal a propaganda poster from a restricted area at his hotel charged with subversion he was hauled before the cameras to make what his parents insist was a staged confession on the early morning of january 1st 2016 i committed my crime [Music] in hindsight it's tragic what my son went through it's tragic he was used as a political pawn a hostage everybody knows it it's absurd to think anything different i entirely beg you people and government of the dpr korea for your forgiveness please i have made the worst mistake of my life the north korean regime showed no mercy two weeks after his confession otto warmbier was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor and vanished into north korea's notorious prison system he had been brutalized by them mentally physically emotionally and spiritually and when that guard pushed otto out of the door think about when that door's shut and he's alone with those bastards think about that that's what i'm haunted by the only proof the north koreans had of otto's crime was this grainy and inconclusive surveillance footage it's from a security camera at his hotel and you can see the time stamp clearly 1 57 a.m on new year's day but according to others on the tour otto wasn't even at the hotel at that time so this shadowy figure simply can't be him that vision has a time stamp on it your group had been out at a new year's eve party in the hours before that were you even back at the hotel then no the time didn't match up at all [Music] i remember getting back to the hotel somewhere around 3am not at all before 2am so that's not even close to 2am you're saying it was more than an hour after that video was supposedly shot that you and otto returned to the hotel correct everything about the whole story was fabricated in my opinion fred and cindy warmbier say their son was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time they're convinced his arrest was a carefully calibrated act linked directly to north korea's weapons program that's when north korea started firing off missiles nuclear weapons and using otto is kind of like their i don't know what you would call it their prize their american prize to rub it in america's face what they were doing just a few days after otto was seized north korea carried out its first nuclear test in three years followed by the launch of a long-range missile tensions with the rest of the world were suddenly at an all-time high and otto became pyongyang's human shield against any international backlash north korea doesn't do anything by mistake it was their fourth nuclear weapons test and they had a lot of things they wanted to cover and they felt like otto was going to provide them the security they needed to get away with these things for 15 traumatic months otto's parents fred and cindy were in the dark about the welfare of their son they were told not to make a noise not to upset the regime for fear they could jeopardize otto's safety it was really hard going through this with the family stuffing our feelings and not being able to deal with anything that whole time we were told he was in perfect health by the north koreans by the cia by our state department that he's in perfect health he's working at a camp all their intelligence tells them that if he was begging for help we'll never know through those dark days the warmbiers never lost hope that their son would make it back to safety hang in there tiger boy you're coming home and not to worry about us but stay strong stay strong and we'll be fine as a family as soon as you get home but even in their worst nightmares they could never have imagined the circumstances in which he did at the president's direction the department of state has secured the release of otto warmbier from north korea he is on his way enroute home to be reunited with his family [Music] fred and cindy discovered that for 15 of the months their son had spent in captivity he'd been in a coma with a catastrophic brain injury he arrived home blind deaf jerking violently and howling we saw evil in his eyes he had seen just terrible things and he had been reduced to this animalistic creature that i couldn't hug and i couldn't get a feeling back from and and it it's just it was horrible but i'll tell you what it does it's a motivator because you go through that and you say otto i'm i'm here for you and you made it home and we're gonna do we're not to get let these people get away with what they did to you period but it was horrible it was just horrible otto would never be able to tell his side of the story he died just six days later since then his parents have made it their mission to expose the evil of north korea to the world the easy thing would be for me to let north korea continue terrorizing me by remaining quiet and doing nothing that would be the easy thing but i'm determined for his life to have a huge impact on the world [Music] since the death of their son otto fred and cindy warmbier have been on their own mission to tighten the screws on north korea and the regime's enablers abroad their pressure has led the us to declare north korea a state sponsor of terror and there have been other successes in shutting down the money trail that props up kim jong-un's regime thank you for asking us to speak because it's five years since i saw otto since since and and nobody's forgotten him still and i just want to tell north korea as long as i'm alive no one's going to forget what you did to otto i'm not going to let them i'm not going away and i'm in it for the long the long haul i'm just patiently waiting because the day is going to come when that regime is over and i won't be happy then there's there's nothing that can make me happy but i'll be relieved [Music] you're both very proud parents but i must say i think otto would be very proud of both of you no more so than i am of him they murdered otto they murdered him they murder people every day and that's why i say how can i be quiet you know otto would be he'd be like mom i don't want you to do this if it's gonna hurt you and it's not hurting me it's not hurting me
