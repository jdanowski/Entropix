the north korean missile was fired from the capital pyongyang and flew over u.s ally japan the man killed was in fact the half-brother of its leader kim jong-un a north korean soldier has defected by crossing the heavily armed border with the south these are the images we see of north korea or the dprk the world's most isolated country but in the fringes there are those who paint a different picture wow very surprising nigerians do you want to get close to the dprk [Music] in a rare look at how cultural forces keep the regime afloat this is all north korean art oh no korean is a team that needs help yeah i see that we uncover an expansive network of friends and allies in unexpected corners of the globe [Music] the mother of kim jong-un she was born here a new day in relations between the united states and north korea at this historic crossroads will this all pay off the assumptions and help north korea come in from the cold the work was done by the north korean society [Music] we came to the city known as the cradle of western art to meet two brothers who were art connoisseurs [Music] eugenio chichony served as the director of the prestigious academy of fine arts in florence while pierre luigi cecione is an entrepreneur who dabbles in the art world that for instance is very strange if you think a leonardo da vinci loves a supper and almost all suppers are on a lot of long table and this is a round table we italians know these things but the pair aren't simply interested in renaissance art they possess something much more alluring and rare this is all north korean art all north korean tucked away on a quiet avenue in the outskirts of town the chochoni brothers showroom boasts one of the largest private art collections from north korea we show this but it isn't meant for people to come in we keep the works here this is quite amazing here i've never seen north korean art person before so can you walk me through yeah he's a military always happy smiling working on in a field in north korea they pay very much importance to work i see a tape recorder that's probably sort of like a karaoke ah north koreans think we defend ourselves from american products do not be fooled by us's disguises this is an interesting look into the psyche of the north koreans the brothers acquired around 500 works during 10 visits to north korea they range in price from a couple hundred dollars for posters to thousands of dollars for more valuable items we buy this as company we organize exhibitions and then we try to sell the works and most of these has been shown in the first exhibition we held in italy really in the west as a way of furthering so to speak the comprehension of a country and more so of a people which in the west are presented by a stereotype of it seems like the art tends to want to glorify he wants to provide a sort of a happy picture of life whether it's real or not yeah not well the image they want to portray absolutely you know positive almost all north korean art is produced by a government arm called mansurde established in 1959 to promote cultural goodwill the studio amasses millions of dollars by spreading north korean culture far and wide including to more than 160 countries that it shares diplomatic ties with the monsoon studio is over 120 000 square meters that's a lot it's a big studio yeah about 800 artists it looks more or less like an american campus there is a soccer field there is a place for the children art has allowed me to get in touch with this unknown country and somewhat mysterious country you ever get criticism though from people who say that weren't you effectively lining the pockets of the north korean regime no it really doesn't you're not getting rich off north korea again absolutely absolutely i was asked if i was representing months today and i was acting on behalf of it and what i clarified is that i didn't act on behalf of it but i was buying from them and then since the sanctions went into effect i haven't bought anything any longer [Music] as international sanctions pile up against the kim regime the trade of all art has been banned monsoon activities are now being scrutinized as an important financial pipeline the u.n even claimed it functions as a front to evade sanctions and bolster military dealings [Music] most of that scrutiny is aimed at china north korea's most important ally home to monster day's only satellite location and in beijing the only gallery bearing its name [Music] of north korean and chinese descent and he's been the director of this gallery for 10 years [Music] [Music] yeah i see that he protests sanctions on art and monster day claiming cultural products shouldn't be subject to political winds what sort of impact do you think you would see if north korean art weren't allowed to be shown in galleries like this she buys most of the works directly from montsure and sometimes from dealers at chinese markets where he says he can strike a good deal is there a lot of money to be made g refused to discuss the business side of his gallery insisting he personally owned the thousands of works here this was a fascinating visit to this gallery but anytime we started talking about money mr g became a little defensive and a little bit cagier and you know i think there's this overriding sense in the international community that any money that goes towards the regime is bad because it could fund any number of programs illicit programs but in some ways the sanctions that have been slapped on north korea actually makes the art more valuable adds to the mystique around anything north korea related one thing became clear during our time in china sanctions don't mean that north korea isn't making money as we contemplated whether the manzoud art market was flourishing quietly despite sanctions we came across a north korean restaurant and filmed on our phones that it was in fact open for business it's one of about 100 in the country with dozens more across asia nothing says green like white bread [Music] [Applause] [Music] employing north korean workers abroad in industries from hospitality to construction annually generates at least one billion dollars and a growing portion isn't coming from traditional allies like china the footprint of north koreans is increasing in much less obvious places unreal in at least 15 african countries the montseude overseas project a specialized section of the montseude studio earned the kim regime 260 million dollars by sending north korean workers to build large-scale structures and monuments this is stunning taking the art market we saw in italy and china to an entirely new level this monument symbolize africa africa um raising up from the deep ground and raising up to sun the sun meaning the new life whatever we can say on north korea it is a specialist on building money standing 160 feet tall this monsoon monument is one of the largest statues in the world it cost the senegalese government 27 million dollars despite the country's struggling economy [Music] foreign does the north korean government and the senegal government have a good relationship yes i think that if the government accepts north korean society to build this monument it was because they have got a good relationship [Music] north korea has cultivated ties with africa since the cold war when it supported black liberation movements today it's thought to maintain economic and military ties across the continent a charge north korea denies nigerians identify with the dprk and they are so excited and they want to get close to the dprk to us here in the developing world to be able to call out the bluff of the so-called superpower the world police as some people will call the united states it's quite interesting alhassan is a professor at the university of abuja over the years he's become enamored with north korea he heads up a pro-north korean association and imparts its teachings to his students regularly so this all just gets stranger and stranger we're here on the university of abuja campus attending an event where students professors and other academics have come together to essentially celebrate north korea celebrate the idea of self-reliance the philosophy that essentially underpins the north korea that we know it today today we came together basically to celebrate an ideology we came together a philosophy that refused to die and that is the future philosophy juche is a belief system that prizes self-reliance developed by the founder of north korea kim il-sung wow very surprising yeah the gj philosophy will chart a course for us i'm the national chairman of adherence of juche idea in nigeria so that is a prime position as far as diplomatic ties are concerned between our two countries north korea has lots of friends here on the continent north koreans that are helping out in agriculture north koreans physically involved in yeah i believe in some other countries like tanzania like ethiopia namibia zambia this is assistance you know the relationship with north korea he's not something based on economic terms okay he's an assistant the dprk is giving africa to help africa out demanding for nothing nothing nothing no exchanges of goods those are just conjectures of western powers because they are looking for every other way to isolate the dprk i think the the assumption is that there must be some exchange because this is a country that struggles to feed its own people well that is the narrative also that you are given that they depend on food stamps and there is these are just conjectures so you're saying that everything in the media everything out there not everything not everything so you're not worried about the section i'm not worried the assumptions have never worked it will never work and i think that is the problem the worst is yet to come to terms with you see giuchi provides the fact that she depends less and less on the outside so these are the two medals i got from the dprk allies in countries like nigeria regard north korea not as a pariah state but a country with something to offer now more than ever before this leader actually stunned me with his style of leadership he has done a lot in terms of remolding the country it is those things most nigerians love dprk most nigerians most nigerians really yeah the country the political entity or the idea all of them because of his ability to stand up to goliath [Music] something dramatic could happen president trump and kim jong-un will meet in just a matter of hours kim jong-un isn't playing games this time around the meeting between trump and kim jong-un came after a period of heightened tensions threats and sanctions its ramifications could extend to matsuday north korean businesses and perhaps more importantly to north korean communities abroad [Music] [Applause] [Music] the mother of kim jong-un she was born here this community kim jong-un's mom is from here yeah there are up to 1 million koreans in japan dating back to the early 20th century japan annexed the korean peninsula and brought many people to work as laborers now a lot of them identify as north koreans kim jong-un's from here people must have a certain preconceived notion about what this place is okay like what else might be here spies agents business connections yeah they might be like people who is sending money to the dprk but they never mentioned that if you mention that you would get punishment it's illegal illegal japanese government right when the korean war broke out in 1950 it halted the repatriation process and many didn't have a home to go back to north koreans in japan have long been discriminated against they exist in the margins and largely work in vice industries like bars and gambling america um [Music] so you still feel lots of discrimination a relationship with your parents to complain loud and smokey in here pachinko is a widely popular form of gambling on slot machines the pachinko industry that exists today was started by north koreans in japan [Music] since korea split in two it's north not south that sent money to the korean community here for education and cultural programs it spread a strong sense of loyalty again um [Music] um [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] um north korea helped establish 80 schools across japan they play a crucial role in perpetuating the country's culture and values providing a safe haven for students i just want to know like the students trump yes or no america yes or no america yeah [Music] what do the teachers hear instruct about [Music] america [Music] [Music] if the us and north korea relationship normalizes how will that impact the north korean community here in japan [Music] much of the western world paints north korea in a very negative light what are we in the west not understanding about north korea [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] a careful cultivation of friends and allies using art culture and education demonstrated a nation's remarkable ability to cobble and scavenge its way to international relevance yet no tangible progress has been made toward a peace deal since the u.s north korea summit in june 2018 nor has north korea disarmed or dismantled its nuclear weapons program meanwhile the monsoon studio remains under sanctions closely watched by the international community [Applause] [Music] you
