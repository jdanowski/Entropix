these are crazy rules in north korean schools up first since military service in north korea is mandatory all students in school must take some sort of combat training this is to make all the kids better soldiers for the future next up students cannot leave school at all in most countries if a student gets special permission from a parent or a doctor they can leave school but in north korea you cannot leave no matter the situation or the emergency they will not let you leave finally every morning when the students first get the class every single student must stand in front of the two portraits of kim jong-un and kim jong-il and then bow and show their respects also anytime someone enters or leaves the room they have to do this
