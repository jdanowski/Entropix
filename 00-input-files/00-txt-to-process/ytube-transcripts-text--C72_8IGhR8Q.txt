when the air tags were first announced there was 
one thing i was especially looking forward to test   and that was how good are the air tags at tracking 
parcels being shipped overseas well i thought   about shipping one to a friend abroad but that 
just didn't seem that interesting to me so instead   i shipped three one to tim cook at apple's 
headquarters one to elon musk at spacex   and lastly one to north korea i was gonna send 
a fourth one to the white house but a lawyer   advised me against it warning there could be 
national security implications so i thought   yeah all right suppose i want someone 
to the white house now i will say   if there was any test that proves 
just how effective the air tags are   it would be this one honestly this project was 
so interesting and you're about to find out why now the first thing i want to address is is 
this even legal i tried to find information   on the legalities of tracking a parcel and well 
there's not a lot of information out there so i   got in contact with some lawyers the first lawyer 
i contacted was from germany and he didn't see any   legal issues and tracking a parcel with an attack 
the second lawyer i reached out to was from the us   and he had this to say legally you should 
be fine including an air tag in a package   you're not tracking a person but a package so 
you shouldn't run afoul of any privacy laws   he then started going on about how the 
air tag would deactivate after three days   acting like he knew the product better than me 
come on mate stick to your day job second thing   do i really think elon musk or tim cook will 
get my package honestly probably not but maybe   i'm sure the both of them receive a lot of fan 
mail and for that reason there could be some   form of redirection or mail forwarding put 
in place so if either of the parcels make it   to the intended destination honestly i'll be 
more than happy with that outcome last thing   north korea shipping items to north korea from 
the us is not an easy task in fact due to strict   economic sanctions imposed by the united states 
or mail to north korea is regulated by the office   of foreign assets control so at the moment only 
first class letters and postcards can be sent   but i live in germany and it just so happens 
that dhl is one of the few logistics companies   that still offer shipping to north korea why 
north korea well the intention here certainly   isn't to be in any way provocative but there's a 
lot we don't know about this country especially   from a technology perspective like do they have 
access to the internet or do they even own iphones   well unless they have both of those the 
ear tags will go completely undetected   but fear not i came across a website called stack 
counter which claims to have data on north korea's   smartphone market share and according to them 
iphone is the second most popular smartphone in   the country second to samsung but what's weird is 
just last month apple was number one i had to dig   deeper into this so i dug through this website to 
try and understand where and how exactly they get   their data it turns out they have their tracking 
api code installed on over two million websites   globally with this tracking data they're able 
to extrapolate which country a user is from and   which device they're using i dug even deeper and 
found out that they even provide the sample sizes   of their data for each country for north korea 
the smartphone sample size was 538 it's not a lot   but it's good enough for me so we 
begin this journey on dhl's website tim cook's parcel will be sent to the famous 
apple park headquarters in san francisco one   apple parkway the package to elon musk is going 
to the spacex headquarters at one rocket road   in hawthorne california man both these companies 
have their own roads respect at this point it   occurred to me that i needed a mailing address for 
north korea after some browsing on google maps i   noticed there was a german embassy in the center 
of pyongyang perfect i found the address for the   embassy online and of course entered it in i made 
sure to include track and trace shipping for each   of the parcels so we could compare dhl's updates 
with my air tag updates boy am i glad that i did   that i also made sure to declare the air tag on 
each of the customs forms that way no matter who   receives this parcel they know that there's an 
air tag inside of it it was the right thing to do   with the shipping labels printed out and slapped 
on these envelopes i prepared the air tags apple   got the unicorn ear tag spacex got the alien and 
north korea just got the standard one now i didn't   want to send the air tag by itself that would just 
be weird so i wrote a friendly letter for each of   the recipients basically i told them about this 
project asked them what they thought about it and   then asked if they could sign and return the air 
tag to me i then took this opportunity to throw in   a dogecoin for elon musk to center the moon with 
that all done we were ready to rock and roll i   dropped off the parcels on friday the 7th of may 
in the afternoon a few hours later i could see   that the air tags were on the road making their 
way south right from the get-go this was really   exciting dhl don't inform you when a parcel leaves 
the post office so i already had more information   than one would normally get which i'm not gonna 
lie was pretty cool while the air tags were on   the road i was getting updates every 10 to 15 
minutes or so not bad the parcels made it to a   packet station in a city called langenfeldt where 
they spent the night how cool are these 3d views   when i woke up the next day i realized my 
packages had made it all the way to frankfurt   airport but i had no update from dhl three days 
later the air tax was still giving me regular   updates but the parcels hadn't moved at all from 
frankfurt airport i got my first update from dhl   on the parcel heading to spacex which told me the 
shipment is transported to the destination country   slash destination area and hand it over to the 
delivery organization there yet i could clearly   see that the parcel had not yet left frankfurt i 
kept my eyes peeled to watch out for any movement   but nothing come the 12th of may apple's parcel 
had received the same notification yet also no   movement we were now at the 14th of may a full 
week later and all the parcels were still at   frankfurt airport i was so confused and really 
frustrated to make matters worse the north korean   parcel had no updates at all elon's parcel did 
move to the other side of the airport but that's   about it on saturday the 15th it finally looked 
as though something was happening the packages for   apple and spacex had moved to what looked like a 
loading bay they were ready to fly now it was late   in the afternoon and there weren't many flights 
left for the day so i checked if there were any   cargo flights bound for america i came across 
an aerologic flight that had an unmarked arrival   destination i'd never heard of this airline before 
but i found out that they were half owned by dhl   so i had a good feeling that this was the flight 
as i tracked the flight just a few minutes after   takeoff the arrival destination was added and it 
was heading straight for jfk airport in new york i   woke up at 4 am the next day to screen record the 
landing not long after landing we had confirmation   my air tags had made it to jfk airport new 
york in the usa oh it was a sight to behold   i checked dhl's website for an update but nothing 
i only got an update from dhl two days later   on the 18th of may informing me that apple's 
parcel had arrived thanks dhl i already knew   that two days ago what's worse is elon's parcel 
didn't get this update until the 21st of may   why they were on the same flight on the 19th 
of may dhl had notified me that apple's parcel   had cleared customs and was ready to leave jfk but 
nothing happened until the following day when i   received a notification on find my it had picked 
up the signal of tim cook's parcel in nevada and   like in the middle of nowhere i knew straight away 
that it must have been picked up mid-flight so i   jumped on flight radar and found a flight that 
had already left from jfk and was very close to   where my air attack had been pinged unbelievable 
most likely someone's iphone was connected to the   internet mid-flight made a connection to my air 
tag and that location data was then sent to me   what an age we live in surely enough not long 
after touchdown i get a second update from the   air tag and it was in san francisco check this out 
so sick now elon's parcel was still at jfk airport   and sadly still no update on the north korean 
parcel i was starting to get worried about it   the next day apple's parcel had arrived 
at a local post office in cupertino   the u.s postal service had then notified me that 
the parcel had been picked up by the recipient   eventually i could see it was on the road and 
very close to arriving at apple park i was so   excited i thought this is it but it didn't stop 
there it kept going it eventually stopped at what   seemed to be some kind of logistics center after 
spending a few days at this logistics center   the air tag was finally on the road again 
hope was restored and finally on may 24th it arrived i was over the moon i mean look at how 
cool that looks so sick on the same day elon's   parcel had made it to california unfortunately i 
wasn't able to pick up on the flight it took but   things were starting to fall into place nicely 
on tuesday the 25th elon's parcel arrived at a   local post office and began heading towards 
its final destination and what do you know it made it unbelievable honestly i had no 
idea if any of these parcels would make it   to the intended destination and the fact 
that two halves so far was mind-blowing   but on the north korean front things weren't 
looking too good the parcel still didn't have   an update and it was still stuck at frankfurt 
airport i was devastated so i tried contacting dhl   who told me i need to submit an investigation 
to find out what was going on after doing that i   was told i would need to wait an additional three 
weeks before i would get an answer not okay with   me so i decided to send another one this time i 
decided to try a different north korean address   so i stumbled across this website for a north 
korean film festival commission i don't know   but it had an address and it was good enough 
for me so i repeated that whole process again and sent that bad boy on its way it made 
it to frankfurt and was chilling with the   first north korean parcel now here's the great 
news on may the 29th i got an update from dhl   informing me that the second package is 
now on its way to the destination country   meaning it's eventually going to go to north 
korea so if you want to find out what happens   to that parcel be sure to subscribe i really 
didn't want to have to split this video into   two sections but it's already been almost 
a month now and i really wanted to get this   video out there for you guys and of course 
i'll be following up on what happens with   the air tags that were sent to tim cook and 
elon musk and if you haven't seen it yet check   out this video i made where i intentionally 
left three valuable objects in public to be   stolen and of course they had air tags attached 
to them thanks a lot guys see you next time you
