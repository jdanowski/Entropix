and um i understand that when you left north korea um because of the famines you went to china would you be able to tell us a little bit about that please this communists steal my nightmare you know that is that we usually see dead bodies in outside and we everyday heard my neighbors who died for families died and their family members separated and they don't know each other's so it was a really pimple moment because many endeavors we uh life is together all all this isn't our whole life but we've seen these dead bodies but we couldn't say that people died of stubby we said that these people died an illness because the north korean government said it was socialism country no one hunger no one died of the study yes i remember them saying that if you if you used the word famine that it would actually be forbidden and punishable if you you said it was because of starvation as you said yes yeah so that's why government said that it was all those march because all those much this means in 1930s when kim il-sung fight the japanese era and they happened at this moment they know food or something that they just only stayed some places so they really hard times they explained it to us we learned that but we didn't know that that is true or not so government said that it's a habitat also is all those much we fight against americans so they never solved any problems so in 1996 but you know there's many many families and people i knew died in a street and one day in 1996 my uncle my lovely uncle died stabbing in front of me i'm sorry to hear that and i understand i'm sorry so that is really a pimple and me and my father is a speechless we couldn't say anyone you know and then i had a lot of questions because we believed our leader we respected to them we really had to work but why we received this kind of study why they not solving these problems i had a lot of questions but i couldn't say because i really scared about the systems and then my brother also started the illness because he also shocked because he was a work party member you know he always respected to them but his brother died of studying and his colleagues the same is a diet of disturbance so he was shocked and then he started is hemorrhoid a heart problems and but we couldn't get any medicines so my brother also stood many situations on the illness but again 1997 happened again it's my younger brother also came to home he left his militaries because first times i didn't understand i didn't know why he left his military but then after he explained it to us he's joined in some groups because in north korea usually paid respect money to government that is not only his people is a student the housewife is a company workers everyone is paid respect money to government you know but uh did my my brother also joined these groups because they want to make money but they failed and they didn't made money to government so this means really political meanings they punish it and they send it to prisons so that's why their crew members run out run out and he went to the home so he went to the home and two days after soldiers came to my house and they finally found out my younger brother and then they beaten to him you know and then they arrested him okay but he escaped again so i have to save my younger brother and then my illest father last week was save your younger brother you leave this country you have to leave this country so that's why 1998 it was a february very cold winter so i abandoned my illness father alone in cold dining room and then i left north korea with my younger brother so i still don't know when my brother passed away and very sporty i'm sorry to hear that um i understand that um when you um left for china as well you became separated from your younger brother as well didn't you yes yes once in china i thought that maybe me and my younger brother life was changed because i thought that china was cleaner places but it was that is the same as north korea so my younger brother and me separated the reasons that i was sold to chinese man because it's many brokers in border aliens you know they undercut north korean females and they're selling to us so same as me i was a human trafficking assault to chinese man and separated my younger brother and then he sent back to north korea so now is 20 years is passed but i still don't know that he's a survivor or not because i don't get any informations but i never keep up my health one day i have united with my younger brother so i never give up i stay with my mother i hope that does happen um so i understand that eventually um the chinese authorities found you and sent you back to north korea again yes yes i stayed in eastern china six years and also i have a son but my son was a statelessness uh child because china government not allowed my son and they not to give to him is the kind of identifications the reasons that i was north korean so they not accept my child so my child also five years statelessness other than my life was the same statelessness life in china so in china so usually they find out that it's north korean refugees because north korea under china they made the agreement in 1983 both countries is who people escaped their country and then they sent back to them with them so they're not allowed that is the united nations the justice or refugees issues they never allowed to that because of two countries social and communist countries so so china is usually find out the north korean refugees so someone who find out the north korean refugee and then contacted the police and after they paid money to them so north korea is always this kind of price you know women is human trafficking and they learned a lot of money and the summer is funded to north korean refugees and also china paid money to people so many people they can't vote because they find out the north korean refugee this money is better than the monthly salaries so same as means someone is contacted to is a foreigner or peace this person is not conducted to police he contacted this original peace and then so that's why 10 chinese authorities came to my house in nine times and they arrested me in front of my son that time is he only five but i couldn't explain this to him what happened and i couldn't say to him goodbye or waiting mom i didn't say because chinese authorities never allowed to be me and my son's last ones so and then i sent back to north korea and my son a long time that must have been really difficult and i i know that you were sent to a prison camp weren't you and i believe that you were so much that you got gangrene in your leg and then they they said you can't stay in the prison camp anymore you you have to leave and this is where um when you were sick you went back all the way back to retrieve your son and yeah yes yeah we sent back to north korea first we sent the security presence so this security presence we stayed in in only one places with the van and the women and the inside they have but only one toilet and this toilet is covered only 50 centimeters and everyone is just sat down in front of the toilet or people so ben and woman is usually using one toilet and if they use that is a stand up and everyone is sick and they have got no spirit display spaces so we sat down and we cannot move so if we move and they punished to us and the nighttime we slept is under the under the people because it's those parents and no window and no water inside so that's a high thing it's really disgusting and the smell is disgusting and the food was very disgusting so inside they asked to ask three questions first so do you met south koreans when you lived in china or do you visit the church he said do you believe the religion or something else they ask and the third one is is many people you know that they try to uh left escape to china again because china is not the same country so many people they wanted to go to south korea but their journey was failed and sent back to north korea so these three is really main political problem issues so these people have to send political presence and it's the same as means human trafficking or someone need to fight food or with the boat across the border so that is less than its political issues so we send it to another concentration camp it's kind of ut education camps so i then i sent to the education camps and the party education campus did not allow the shows we worked in our south because in case we escaped this land or places so we always is a bad foot walking outside but north korea is not capable kind of pavement they really dirty and on pavement under stones glasses you know it's an animal piece everywhere so i worked in countryside in farmer areas so when i stepped in classes or stones and they were bleeding but we continued to if you stopped and they just kick torture any times you so i didn't know what happened but i maybe stepped because already is uploading and also i also manipulated because inside not it's a proper code manipulated and impacted these spiders so one day my temple is 39 or 40 degrees and sometimes i was stable but they didn't give me any medicines and then my leg was swallowed and all layers changed the color is dark purple colors and also my body smelling was is a look like that is a dead person's smelling and the hair color is changing face was changed everything is you know under my half bodies they were unable is touched because it's in here it's my head is i wanted to go toilet but i already did because it's a halfways i didn't it's feeling everything that so that's why they said that you cannot died inside the camp you just died outside anyway so they released me because they talked about this i could be died yeah but i survived the reasons that i said my son alone invaded me in china so my son is my last family so my strength was started i wanna united my son that is my hope that is i stayed in prisons all right so i never died that's that's good um it sounds really horrible that the conditions that you're in in that prison camp and i'm really sorry to hear that that happened to you um but i understand that of course you you obviously did recover and you went to retrieve your son in china and then made your way to was it the gobi desert in mongolia yes yes yes so when they released me and three months i stayed in public places and then every week police checked my conditions because if my condition is better they bring me again in prison so if they bring me again to prison i could be died so i usually hide uh my conditions to a policy but i that times i continue to it's a yellow what has came out and i couldn't walk that time but uh three months after i did my work but i hide i continued to hide to them and then you know in 1998 when first my ex escaped north korea last time is not many brokers inside north korea but in 2004 that was changed totally changed you know many brokers inside and they look up look after girls and women's because the poland women's this morning in time so i already knew that i already knew that so that's why i promised to brokers it's a human trafficking to myself to china because my son went to me in china so i had no options because my health is not good and i had no money so that is only my options i choose my option that is saved my son's way so myself for human trafficking to china but once in china we on the taxi and you know that is when i when we cross the north korean border we not only me is with broker and also another lady same as human trafficking and also old man so we pull people across the border and then after we own the taxi but usually taxi driver is the same they asked a lot of questions so if we didn't say chinese and the kids drive to us it's a police station but it's three people they can't speak chinese it's only me speech chinese so i want to say to him this is a family and i had problems because the snail feeds my legs so here they went to the hospital something that so he believed so i saved all people so then i want to talk to him and he's a broker so i have a son i want to contact it to him but first he denied but the next day he told me that he also two children in north korea so yesterday's if you didn't receive it to us maybe i also sent back to north korea state of prison so my children also sent to prison but you saved my children so that's time is i want to save yours and your child so he said that's free to go so so that then i want to find out my son and in 2005 we want to we wanted to go south korea because the many people they got many north koreans they went to south korea but our journey was failed which is really dangerous returning because we had no passport no kind of identification identity cards so we can't inside the south korea embassy so then we met nine north korean refugees in front of the beijings uh in south korea embassy and then nine people we said that it's they have one of the subscribers but we didn't know the where is the ulabata but it's all people we talked about is the same survivor we have to left this country that is only we think about that so that's why we went to the mongol the mongol in really mongolia border areas and we crossed this chinese border but the china border is very strong defenses and two meter highs so we close this cut off this border and then many people just one month but me and my son that time is my son is only six and me they had problems so we didn't run and my son is didn't understand why we crossed this border he's really scared so i only hold his hand and we walked walked and after i find out that the chinese police car and the kaiser came to us it is closed for us i really scared this moment but i couldn't say any word i just only strongly handled my sons and after is some one barney's camped to us this one camped us so i thought that it was a chinese police but this man not the chinese police and this man came to us and parked my son and hold my hand and then we run run and cross the second chinese border and then run and after arriving at bongoria border areas so after i looked at him and he also north korean refugees we met in beijing but he said to me and my son's life because he already went to the mongolia and he didn't find me and my son so he crossed again because he knew that if he arrested and received back to north korea and what happened he already knew but he never cared about himself so he only talked about this one mother and the one this child i wanted to rescue he only talked about so he saved me under my son and then i failed to love him so he's now is my husband yeah we live together that's uh one thing that you can always take away that's a very happy thing that the the uh the man who helped rescue you from china also is now your husband which is which is great i mean it's nice to hear that something positive actually happened to you and um i understand that um once you got to mongolia i think you were referred to the u.n weren't you and then they were the ones who were able to get you out is that right oh no we stayed in mongolia it was a desert you know but i didn't talk about this mongolia was a desert you know and my image in the desert was this sun lots of sun but this mongolia is totally different you know and then we stayed in desert three days and we couldn't find any persons so after our food is gone and the water is gone and it was really cold so first my son is dying because of thirsty hunger under his others is the same and then we decided that we cannot die to this desert because nobody find out that is our bodies so then we cross the border again and went to china okay and then i stayed in china uh yeah with this man and two years and stayed in china two years so my husband is made korean dessert in our home and then i sold to in a market so our lives two years in kind of this self-business life in china and then i met the korean pastors in a market because he was my customer and he knew that we were north koreans so he then sent to us united nations but first time is i didn't believe that united nations helped to us because i never heard the united nations these names and what kind of work they do i never knew that so i only talked about that this is a kind of brokers yeah because simply i talked about that is a united nation and also kind of brokenness so we went to the united nations and they asked us which country they wanted to go it's a south korea america or european country but you know the people i said that is i can't choose the united st and i didn't choose the south korea and america because already my experience was perpetuated to north korea and what happened in prison we already seen this kind of that so we don't know that our journey is a success or not but at that time so we have a children because my older son and then my second person was born in china so we have two children now that times a bit and we now is the whole family because me and my husband and children so we have to choose a safe country but north korea if we on on success and every country is not is a for us everything is a political meaning but risk is less than america or south korea's another countries you know so so that's why i chose england the reasons that north korea and england is not enemy countries yeah yeah yeah yeah so that is maybe be unsuccessful this journey but our risk is less than south korea america journeys so that's why we chose england and
