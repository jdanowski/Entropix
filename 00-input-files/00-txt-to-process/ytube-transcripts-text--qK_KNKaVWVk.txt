i'm like trying my best to you know not to get emotional about this because my tears is not what they need like they really need my help and our help and i feel terrible that there's nothing else i can do more than what i'm doing to telling you telling the truth doing everything i can to raise awareness and i'm not even sure if that's enough because like the world leaders knows this like american president have every information that he needs they exactly know how people of north korea have been treated and what you have been going through but they don't act and they don't do [Music] anything hi guys welcome to my channel my name is amy park i'm a nordskin de facto human rights activist thank you surf shark for sponsoring today's video using vpn really changed my life as i talked

promo code and vpn for your sake literally i have been talking about the reality that north korea has been facing the suffering the misery that people are facing every single day and the injustice that they are experiencing in their life is unimaginable today i honestly didn't really plan to even do this video it was not in my plan however after watching this news clip on youtube i had to pick up this you know camera and tell the world what's happening to my people because you know mostly north korean news never make it mainstream and this is the only way that i know how to talk about my people so this is all about a video on actual video that was captured by somebody in china and so when i was sharing my escape story i said that i was i crossed the frozen river between north korea and china and in that river there are the border guards in north korea with guns ready to shoot anyone who crosses therefore like crossing this river means literally you're risking your life and luckily i survived i didn't get shot but a lot of them do not make it and that's why right now officially only over 200 north korean defectors made it to america during the 75 years guys imagine that only over 200 north korean people made it to america during the 75 years how hard it is to escape from north korea and in the past when i talk about the experiences that my people are facing people literally saying oh don't be exaggerating how can be that bad why would they shoot you like they would like why why is so hard to escape and here is an evidence that in front of us that we cannot deny what is happening to north korean people is a holocaust so let's see this uh first clip is the same video but from different angle it is about a video mother and daughter like myself i escaped with my mother in the frozen river and then luckily my mom and i both are alive we didn't get shot but the mother in this video gets shot and dead on the spot and the daughter witnessing the mother's death and she is losing her mind so as you can see there is a people gathering is that north korean side and the person who is recording in the china side and i think the these ladies had a brokers i us when i crossed in the river there was a broker across the river ready to receive us so they were waiting and during the daytime i'm sure so there's this possibility when we crossed we cannot potentially possibly bribe all the guards because there are so many of them luckily maybe i drive one guard and then the other guards in the hundred meters of way he can see us still like shoot us so there's no way like guarantee your safety when you cross this river so we don't know if they had a guard they bribed or why but maybe somebody saw them and shot them and therefore right now do you see that like though somebody just collapses to the like on on the ice and that is a daughter and on the other across her that is a mom who's like who's died and the soldiers trying to get get her back north korea and i crossed this exact same river this yellow river and i lived in that city where you see that's called hezhan and i crossed in march 26th of 2007 and i think this is a bit later than that river is not completely frozen so the daughter does not even know what to do at this point and the thing is that even the daughter is alive if she goes to china in this point because she's closer to chinese side she's still gonna get captured and sent back to north korea and either got executed or sent to political prison camp so somebody's keep like jumping and like crying daddy's a daughter and their guards already came and trying to collect the mom's body back to north korea so this is the more original video that radio free asia i think got from somebody use a first name to report this video to them to get it out so let's watch it from the beginning my hometown this is about a daughter and mother who was crossing the river and mom got shot and daughter is crying and the lady who is late there that's a mom who just got shot and just died on the spot [Laughter] and i just hear the sounds from north korean sides like hey please like please like hey come back come back to this side like quickly so north korean soldiers are demanding them to bring the bodies of mom and daughter to back north [Applause] [Laughter] korea and daughters keep crying and do you guys see the people in the north korean side are gathering right now uh in north korea like river is a very essential part for our daily lives because we don't have running water at home so where do we wash our clothes in the river in this freezing winter on that ice children go there wash their clothes and so many times we get drained because especially this springtime we don't know how stable the ice is sometimes you sleep during the interviewer and you die and also we go there not only is washing hands and washing our clothes we literally go there bringing the drinking water to house so i think now a lot of north koreans are gathering just looking at that what's what's going on [Laughter] there yes [Music] do you see that this chinese the man in the chinese side and just really being kind of careful holding that thing is because in case his like ice goes down he can use it to come back up so it's very fragile time into being the river it's very dangerous to be and the yacht river is like um the water speed is very very fast it's not like gently going down below the ice it's a it's the highest tourist mountain in like in that region it's a back to mountain so the speed is so fast so in one second you can just go under the ice and never can come back up and that's why it's really dangerous to be in this river right now so it wasn't just only mom and daughter and there was i think some another group was joining the maybe another lady was there usually when north korea's crosses as a group because that's how brokers like prefer it and it cost more money i mean the same cost to you know take one person or to person they use the same car and the same fee and i think that's why there are some other people who is also crossing with them is together with them right now [Music] [Music] oh oh [Music] i'm like i'm like trying my best to you know not to get emotional about this because my tears is not what they need like they really need my help and our help because it's so sometimes so like painful to be where i am right now to be free and it just that was me like literally me that was my mother and i cannot imagine like anyone has to go through that this was like less than two years ago um and like end of 2018 and this is like north koreans daily life they risk their life to be free and freedom is not free for them it's so hard to get for them and just seeing that this daughter that she if there's no words that i can express the injustice that she fears of pain that she fears oh i don't know how to even end this video i just hope that the world realizes that what's happening to nursing people is not it's beyond anything that we have ever seen and we must stop it we must do everything we can to stop it and i feel terrible that there's nothing else i can do more than what i'm doing to telling you telling the truth doing everything i can to raise awareness and i'm not even sure if that's enough because like the world leaders knows this like american president have every information that he needs to exactly know how people of north korea have been treated and what you have been going through but they don't act and they don't do anything i cannot keep thinking like if a polar bear was like that guy's shot and how many views that's gonna get and how many people are gonna be starting a campaign to save them and these are human beings these are mothers and daughters and somebody's children somebody's sister every life matters every life is a gift and that's why thank you for not losing hope with me standing with me and caring about this so unfortunate people i cannot even believe like what so many things that i don't understand about life and the world but all i know right now is this is not okay we gotta stop it and because i know i figured it because you know i survived it and i know i don't deserve it but it's not like i want any of us to be guilty about that us being free and being in safety and freedom but i just like who are we being okay with this right we have so much in this world that we can fix this problem we have so much resources we have so much intelligence so much power and we can solve this problem as a humanity so thank you guys that it was very like it just it i'm absolutely speechless and i just hope that it helped you to understand a bit more about north korean people and what what they are going through and thank you for supporting me towards my voice and for north korean people looking forward to seeing you guys all next time
