no biscuit no it's a sweet this is only special day in kimberlen's birthday it's they give to us gift one kilograms biscuit and sweet so that is special [Music] when i lived in north korea i didn't know too much about the outside countries we never seen outside countries movies we only watched north koreans movie and kim family's documentaries north korea is distribution countries so everyone is a different amount is government gives us food so house wipes 300 grams a day and the strength is the same 300 grams and the high school is 0.3 grams universities 600 grams and workers 700 or 900 grams when a mother bringed this rice and she divided 15 days and also divided three meals you know that is never enough to us so we always hunger but we never complained to our family is the parents because that is a government rules no biscuit no it's a sweet this is only special day in kimberlen's first day is they give to us gift one kilograms biscuit and sweet so that is special for early 1990s government stopped the sport so people just died of stabbings so we usually saw these dead bodies in the street and in marketplace or in in upper areas and every morning we woke up and we heard that some family died of stuff in their rooms but in early 1996 though one day is the my uncle's colleague came to my home and she told me that my uncle is very endless when i sold my uncle i really shocked because my uncle already starving but he didn't tell it to us so look like him his own skins and bones so he stayed seven days at home and then he passed away so when i saw him i couldn't speak out and my brother also silent but i really loved my uncle because it went my parents busy and he always told to us nighttime stories so i really loved him but my lovely uncle died of stopping in front me really shocked that times my head kind of lot of questions why we respected to them but why we returned about that is starving how government solve these problems but i scared how can i ask to these questions to government or some another people so i also silence too my brother he didn't say any word but he also think about the same as me when he saw his brother died of stubby and he also i think his changed mind but last time is my brother conditions really bad and he didn't walk so i waited my condition my brothers if he condition is better i want to live to these countries with my brother and the younger brother too but my brother is condition is really bad last time my brother told me that you saved your younger brother you leave this country i left him alone in cold dining room and i left only one power rice and cleaning clothes next to him if someone find out to my father give to give to him last meal so me and the younger brother left north korea in other times so i still don't know when my father passed away and when he was 48 me and my younger brother met near the chinese border and we crossed the border it's midnight to 2 a.m from north korea to the china that is between this is the liver is only 25 meter not too high so it's present so me and the younger brothers this is run so we it's a halfway then we heard that is somebody just shouted to us stop stop and they got fired to us but we already closed water so we knocked to house and this is the korean chinese so he gave to us it's nice meals it's white rice and also boiled eggs i'm really surprised because i thought that china is really poor countries he told me that that is not a safe place because it is night time is already confirmed in north korea's side so in the morning maybe chinese authorities such a distant place so you are not saved this place and after he told me that if you saved your younger brother you have to marry chinese man it's usually in china they both north korean females they look like to us sex slavery and workers we say that if you're not married chinese one we contacted two police and you sent back to north korea my brother told me that sister you have to go i survived myself in here don't worry so my brother didn't survive in china he sent back to north korea so now he's almost 28 with 20 years so i still don't know his survivor or die and where is him but i never give up i stay with my younger brother so what was your life like with the chinese farmer who bought you his mother told me that is i borrowed a lot of money and bulk to you so you can walk outside and paid this money i didn't understand 4 30 i a a.m i woke up and then walk until the dark days and she gave me only rice and kimchi that's life was really i really hated me you know that's his slavery life again in north korea is in china so some so sometimes i talked about i wanted to suicide because i didn't save my younger brother i lost all families but one day i found out i was pregnant nobody had to my delivering child yes 12 hours i paint and then i burst my child but i'm very happy it's my family so when my child hungry days is a chinese man really drunk and he came to home and he took he told me that i wanted to sort my child i just stand up and i holding the knife if you touched my son i kill you he's my family he's given me dreams and he's given me some hopes five years i stayed in china and last time i moved to many many areas because i can't stay in one areas because they already know that and that is really dangerous so i moved many many areas it's midnight when i worked in market and i came to home ten chinese authorities came home the really big and fat guys came to my home and they arrest me in front my five years old child my heart is just speed with and i know that is if i arrested and sent back to north korea i this is execute or prison camp so they handcuffed me and my child didn't understand what happened then he asked me that mommy why did you abandon me why you leave me so when i heard these questions i didn't say no no no i didn't say i just cried cried because i didn't abandon him abundantly but his five years old child he talked about that my mom has abandoned me so at this point you're sent back into north korea yes yeah yeah we first went to the north korea security prison camp so in prison that is a small room and we usually sit between 50 or 60 people together in noon so we woke up same as 5 a.m and until the 11 p.m we always always sat down and we couldn't move if we removed something that they also punished to us supporting females sleep together and we usually use totally used toilets in a bucket and the inside is not right so one day i found out that my leg was problems and i had 39's temple but they didn't give any medicines and the next day my leg was swallowing then after this yellow waters came out and many people told me that that is smelling is really disgusting these smellings look like dead bodies smelly and usually isis is stable because it's high temperature they put me is government the places this place is orphanage house that is often the houses government looked for these places so i stayed these places three months but my leg was still the problems i have to leave because if i didn't i don't i didn't leave this country i may be sent back prison again so you managed to get away from the government building where you were being treated but how did you get back into china with an injured leg first time i left north korea in 1998 i didn't read broker i didn't use but in 2004 they have lots of brokers in north korea so they these brokers usually find out who crossed wanted to know china but they usually find out the females not the males because the female is money in china so i told him i wanted to go china and he said that human trafficking so i agreed to him and i knew that is what means human trafficking but i have no choice i had no money and my condition is really bad but i hide to him i didn't tell him my leg was problems so he accept me and then we cross the border broker and me and one females same as me human trafficking and one old man he is binded his relatives in china so in midnight 2 a.m we crossed to the tumor neighbor so when we crossed the border and then we couldn't walk in road areas because in china they usually find out north koreans because the reasons that is north korea south this chinese government paid to them if they find north koreans so testimonies really top these salaries so many chinese people they don't work they just only find out the north koreans that is better than salaries so we couldn't work is the road areas we work in mountain areas we find out taxi we have to taxi we can't walk these areas so we vandal taxi and then on the taxis poor people so taxi driver on the next two is a north korean broker and the v3 is in park so driver asked to us where did you go but north korean broker you can't speak chinese and then i quickly spoke to him he said the uh address and then he asked us a lot of questions you know it's because this chinese this travel driver they also is the same spice here so ask twas lots why he can't speak so i said he grew up in korea town and he didn't graduated high school so that's why he can't speak so it's and again is young lady why i can't speak it's highness so i told him she's my sister and she's mute but she didn't speak you know she also really scared that time and the young young this old man is my father and he also grew up in korea town and they can't speak chinese so but how did you speak chinese so i said i graduated high school so then he also questioned to us that is really the late times but why you didn't you are going to somewhere so i opted today is my trousers and the show to him is when i walked in mountain and the snake fit me so now is we have went to the hospital so he saw my leg and that times my leg was dark purpose then he believed oh i quickly drive then we arrived at chinese broken house and my north korean broker really angry and then he asked me that is what kind of conversations do you it's a driver and he already know that his driver's spy so i explained everything that and then they laugh so i thought that's oh that's his time then after i told him i have child in here i wanted to quickly direct him this call to him so first day tonight no no you promised to us human trafficking in china then next morning i woke up and it's it's all it's a young young already already gone they already sold to her after korean broker told me that you contacted your son just only once so i quickly tired to his grandma house and i told to him son is mom then my son is only one world mom and he cried and i cried so room is really quiet and everyone is hurt my sons cry and i cried that is really emotional times then my son awful and after korean brocco told me that you saved my life last night i have two children in north korea so if you say i they this driver sent to us chinese police and then i sent back to north korea and maybe i went sent to prison camp but you saved my life so this time i saved your life you have to go when i lived in north korean prison i only talked about this survivor and the united medicine that is my whole dreams but i made my dreams and then i met my son that is really happy moment i still remember it those times i wanted to leave to china because i already knew that china is also dangerous countries too 2007 i met america korean pastor in beijing and he sent to us united nations and the united nations center to us in united kingdom so now that you're reunited with your son did you move to the uk together yes yeah with me did you have any expectations of the united kingdom before you came i know england is the histories this man is always wearing the heart and the woman is wearing the dresses so that is think about that is romantic and maybe different world i thought that is england only white people live in england but in airport you know totally different faces asians africans white people are really shocked that it first shocked me and the second shocked me is newspaper in north college newspaper is really important and that's also politic means but in england a lot of newspapers in street and the people read newspaper then they put pin and then top something's queen's pictures or it's prime minister pictures but never cared so this is oh my god these people maybe have to go present something that that is yeah that is the first reason so what's your life like now oh that is a new chapter in here so i'm really happy every day with families you know my children always smile and these happy moments we have got dinner times you know children go to school and come back home they talked about the school life and they planned something that we always they said smile that is really hard big big happy moment because in north korea we are family but we didn't know that is what means family and what means happy so that is really thankful to uk people to accept to us in here so now is i am new life when you look back at north korea what do you think about it i never think but i only saw the memories in north korea that is still the pimple because that is not a history that is real life you know 75 years dictatorship continued in north korea and the huge concentration camps and the people laughing slavery people still speak about the holocaust in the second world war but this north korea is still to happen concentration camps and they divided our people into their lives so i always think about these people these people also they had dreams a lot of people who have tourette's tend to report that they have fewer ticks or none during sex but the thing about that is that's because it engages your focus so that only applies to good sex um which is really [ __ ] brutal because i've never hurt a guy's ego more than simply going during an intimate moment
