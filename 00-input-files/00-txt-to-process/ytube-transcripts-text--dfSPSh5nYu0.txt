the shimpo south shipyard is north korea's primary submarine shipyard at this location north korea produces the romeo class submarine the single class submarine and the shinpo class experimental ballistic missile submarine these special offenator images captured by maxar technologies gives us a unique and unprecedented view in detail of key facilities at shimpo what makes this image so unique is that it was collected at an extreme high off nader angle of 49.6 degrees and places the viewer in a position to look at the facility as if they were viewing it outside a low-flying airplane activities in the simpo area are closely monitored as north korea prepares to launch its much-anticipated first true ballistic missile submarine as we move into the simposal shipyard one of the first things we notice is a construction site at the southern end of the peninsula most sanos believe that north korea started construction of these facilities in order to support its forthcoming first ballistic missile submarine as we move north from the construction site we come to the static test stand the static test stand is used to conduct pop-up testing is used to validate the construction and operation of the launch tube and also the initial firing sequence of a submarine launch ballistic missile as we move into the main section of the symbol south shipyard we come to two large construction halls a large fabrication hall an open air parts yard and an inclined maintenance way it is here in the construction halls that the final assembly of north korea's submarines takes place the secure boat basin has historically been used for the fitting out of recently launched submarines many analysts believe that when launched north korea's first true ballistic missile submarine will also be located here for fitting out this image of the secure boat basin shows the submersible missile test stand barge with its four distinct corner structures used to support a centrally mounted launch tube during launch operations also visible is a large canopy it is covering the experimental ballistic missile submarine and prevents any observation of activity on or adjacent to the submarine a new ssb and operational slbm capability would give north korea the second leg of the nuclear triad it would advance the survivability of their nuclear forces from a preemptive first strike and it would force the united states and allies to devote more resources to defending and deterring under the sea north korean ballistic missile submarines in addition to their land-based nuclear force as far as we know the shimpo south shipyard and the submarine and ballistic missiles being produced there have not been part of an official negotiation between the united states and north korea over denuclearization but given what is taking place at this location it should figure largely in any true effort at removing nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles from north korea you
