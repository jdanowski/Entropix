actually just talking to nara about hey you realize it's gonna be like 15 hours of fasting [Music] foreign [Laughter] how's your thoughts about ramadan yeah it's gonna be easy it's gonna be simple huh okay all right all right guys i was just telling sunny that i think we should do like a little bet of who we actually think won't be able to handle it and complain first who do you think for you who do you think i think sunny actually because because the first time we did it together sunny was complaining like all non-stop now do you know why because sunny cannot function without coffee sonny needs coffee genie [Laughter] while taking selfie good night see you tomorrow at 3 a.m sweet dream bye-bye good morning everybody let's see all right guys if you remember our videos from last year i used to always use the watch many of you guys said you missed it so here it is back again it's 3 18 a.m we're gonna grab a quick bite and then uh we're going to get some water but not too much water because we learned the lesson that if you drink too much water then you're just going to pee it all out so we got to tell ginny and nara about that all right guys we are all having a diet little bento looking thing we got what's up for sunny yeah yes so sunny's having yogurt and granola granola i don't know why she's doing that together i have prepared well no and i'm actually after this i'm gonna eat something very quickly too so i gotta i gotta stack it up nicely real i'm prepared well prepared this time around oh we gotta introduce this one these are actually not the yeah i know brown dates that um we ate last time however they are red dates uh we understand they're different but these are the only ones that we could find in our local supermarket because i have to be honest we kind of forgot about dates yeah good way to start our my dad but you know what i heard that these ones are also good they're lower it's lowering calories at lower in sugar content but more have more like um vitamins or antioxidants is the word okay you gotta split it up because they're both like chris just hurry up yeah oh sorry i just wanna help you guys sorry were you waiting for me i'm sorry guys what is life everybody what is that she loves april just oh really yeah so guys we just finished our meals and now we're having uh apple juice puree it's pure apple juice and in korea i guess it comes like this not in a bottle yeah and then we're going to have the dates i remember we need to have an odd number of dates so let's try to have three each goodbye okay i wish it's a real date stone the [Music] [Music] [Laughter] morning good morning guys we're deciding what we want to do the three girls are chilling okay guys we are finally ready nara me and chris were ready so the first schedule today we're gonna go to english village so it's apparently around uh paju area so we're gonna go there and have nara speak english and ginny speak english as well there so we're just gonna um you know spend time exploring so let's go to yamama yeah let's go all right guys we made it a little background story so for my birthday actually we were all supposed to come to this junior nara and sunny but the nara had like a last minute shooting so she couldn't come so now we are coming because he's really excited we really want to see nara's english skills yes and basically it's like this is like a village where basically you are forced to speak english for kids for them to come and learn english and experience it without going abroad by the way i'm starving oh my god it's a music video [Laughter] which video which music video does it say well oh that one up there produce x101 oh and then running man oh my gosh it's so big it's all of this up here whoa guys so when you enter this is what it looks like i'm not in korea anymore of course the girls are taking instagram so pictures because of corona right now the place is actually really quiet a lot of the stores aren't open too so typically from what i heard is that when you have a lot of people coming in here there's going to be staffs going around and then like if you can't if you don't speak english um they're gonna take you to like a little prison uh so yeah i think because of corona there's not many people uh and that's why i think i don't know correct me if i'm wrong but i think that's why the entrance is free today so yeah we're just gonna explore and we see a lot of people uh actually come here for photos now so yeah it's actually a really nice photo spot chris are you disappointed guys chris is very disappointed he expected not to speak english but you're lucky lucky girl oh thank you okay let's go all right guys in all honesty we thought this place is going to be like crowded and like bustling and we can spend like i don't know three four hours here but that didn't happen because nobody's here and nothing's open it's actually like a deserted abandoned theme park it seems like now unfortunately because of corona but uh we decided to go to a mall we're gonna go go young starfield mall because nara has yet to been to a starfield mall so we're gonna go there check it out and not be tempted by all the wonderful cafes and restaurants that they have but yep let's go guys we are at hyundai department store we didn't end up going to starfield goyang because it's too far and this is the hardest thing ever you guys because we're so hungry and this is like the biggest challenge for us alrighty guys so we are going into the supermarket because we need to make cookies we want to make cookies for our dessert later and we also need to kill time so we're gonna look for a cookie dough cookie maker wow guys i've never seen a pink oreo we just put inside the car and now we're gonna do some shopping to kill some time uh out of the four of us i think nara and sanya doing the worst nara looks tired sunny looks pissed ginny's happy she got her chips how are you doing are you good i'm hungry [Music] but she said kimchi not kimchi i'm we just made it back home and the three girls are passed out it's only 3 30. they have another four hours saman got we're 25 minutes away and the girls are right there waiting the food's in front of us they can smell it they can smell the lovely food right now but uh yeah um we ordered tunisian food from box or window kangkung again because we thought it was only correct uh jeannie's over there she got the iga bakar and fried rose and uh sunny and i got the i'm good pack of course sunny got iron girlfriend she always i guess yeah i'm good all right guys it is officially 7 24. 24 hours doing good job good job good job looks like she has no strength right now she said i want to eat something no but before we start i want to you know explain to nara and i mean ginny already knows because she has done it with us last year oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Laughter] okay drink first what's up [Music] oh foreign [Music] um okay so to wrap it up i think to be honest genie did exceptionally well i was actually quite surprised and then i think i i was like fine with it because i've been on like a crazy no carb diet for like a month now preparing for like a photo shoot which you guys will see later but i think these two had a little bit of trouble i think i started off yeah i think uh yeah she start off too bad with a meal that obviously could not like i don't know why she did it but i thought i was smart guys i thought i was strategic but i guess that was a dumb mistake and i think gnar i think naru's main thing was the water no water yeah it was just like this the whole day but it was you know good job everyone it was it was a really nice for nara to join us this time and jinyoung of course will join us again oh sorry we're talking anyway guys please check out nara we'll link us up down below please check out genie we'll link your stuff down below please like comment share and subscribe happy ramadan and we'll see you guys next time
