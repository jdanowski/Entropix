crazy laws that only exist in north korea in 2013 north korea's leader made a law that there would only be 28 hairstyles allowed 18 for the woman and 10 for the men but the most unfair part is that the leader's haircut isn't even on the list you can't watch your favorite shows on tv they have three channels to choose from that are controlled by the government the only people who are allowed to own cars are state officials it's estimated that 1 to 10 and 1 000 people can own one you can't make an international call in 2007 a man was shot in a stadium because he made a call outside of north korea if you live in north korea you're forced to stay there for the rest of your life finally if you thought the last one was crazy you're not allowed to have your own opinions that go against the leader's rules you'll be sent away to an educational camp where they'll threaten and torture you until you learn to not have your own opinion
