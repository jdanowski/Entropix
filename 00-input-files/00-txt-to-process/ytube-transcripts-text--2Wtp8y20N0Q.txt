new wait till the to the break we will give you a chance to speak you're discrediting yourself further by interrupting the proceedings we will continue our panel and you can speak when the panel has concluded I think the audience will agree that it's better to allow the DPRK to speak since it is a self discrediting exercise and we will resume our panel conclude your statement and we will go back to our panel there's no need for a microphone these are just the human rights violations committed in the u.s. please shut the mic down since this is not an authorized presentation if we could ask the acoustic please ensure that the microphone is not live thank you so we are calling UN security sir you can either conclude your remarks or you will be removed from the room I also would like to ask you to continue lending an ear to the story of North Korean people so much about my country is buried and lost in political conversations sometimes we forget that North Korea is not just a country failed in a dictatorship but that there are people who have hopes and dreams
