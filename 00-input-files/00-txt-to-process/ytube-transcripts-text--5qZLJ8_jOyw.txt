he told us that this country is not normal country this country there's no hope for your generation and this country is corrupt by the dictator and he told us that there's only north korean people can be free the only way is the united states start to work against north korea i like i asked myself like because i couldn't choose to bond to choose to be born so that's why i was born in north korea but what if what if you can have second chance to be born and which country you want to be born yeah that was the america that was the united states for me yes i think we all asked the questions north koreans because we have been punished for our birthplace so much we always like we didn't choose to be born in north korea nobody chooses that yeah and this is this is injustice and but you fought with your life to be free and you came to america [Music] hi everybody welcome to my channel so today guys i have a very very special guest her name is sherry yang she escaped north korea in for the first time in 2001 and after several attempts she finally made to america to in 2007. now she resides in the states at connecticut and she's about starting her own business there however she has a lot to share with the world what she has gone through to be free and standing where she is right now but also her family story that i'm also keen to hear how she became free and what's her state so thank you guys for coming to see her interview and let's not delay anymore so would you uh would you not give us some quick introduction uh yes uh i am xiao yang and i was born in north korea my hometown is heron city in north korea yeah it's a first kimi sung's first wife's hometown kim jong su yeah and i was born in where of family and high class family yeah my father was a businessman he ran a trading company and he received two honorable medals from kimi sang wow we all know that what it means right of course that that's huge in north korea for sure yeah but when i was 10 years old kim jong-un he had gradually take power from his father kimi sang and first he did was formed the anti-communist group and or yeah in all over the country and ordered each city to punish where of people yeah so my father my father was first targeting our town he was put on public trial and eventually sentenced to prison and the government took our property away and i when i was when i arrived at the trial i found people our closest friends drawing rocks and my father and yelled him a traitor and actually in these days or at the time uh economic criminal wasn't the serious crime isn't it but the thing is kim jong-il orders so in north korea kim dictators word kim dictator's words are the law yeah therefore the intelligence officer who was in charge of my father's case he framed my father and yeah sent to prison because he wanted to take advantage from the opportunity to succeed yeah and then after my father released from prison after one year i didn't recognize my father's face because he had been starved and beaten so badly and my father's side relatives are all high ranking officers so one of the high ranking officers in pyongyang uh sent the investig investigation team to heron city in our town to reinvestigate my father's case yeah and then at the same time one of the people who the intelligence officer sent prison he took revenge on him he recalled that he's saying like blaming kim regime yeah and sent it to the prosecution so like suddenly the intelligent officer and his family sent political camp oh my god it does i mean this kind of things can only exist in north korea like korea yes so the government the government admitted that the case uh my father's case was uh wrong and i my father became innocent but the thing is my father already sent to prison and they they didn't 100 admitted their you know they were wrong so they didn't uh give his two mothers and workers party members back to my father but also they gave up they gave my father's chance to apply workers membership but my father was refused because he he thought that it was meaningless right you know you know what i mean uh because you know he after he sent to prison he saw so many horrible things there and he knew that this country is not normal country and then he just he didn't really want to serve the government and he also knew that if you work for the government if you are on top you know officer high ranking officer it means your life could be in danger at the same time so he refused that and after when i was 16 years old i was selected to the pleasure squad oh my gosh yeah and i i have passed the order examination and finally the instructor from pyongyang came to our hometown and i signed the paper to go to pyongyang but i don't know why but because it's a 10 year old girl have experienced those huge shock things seeing father you know people throwing rocks and my father and they yelled him like traitor i think it was the biggest shock for me therefore my adolescence was eventful i was very rebellious against the government like yeah for example uh the government says hey oh it isn't illegal for women have to have long hair then i kept my hair long oh i don't really bring the scissors to karito like in my town they literally bring scissors to cut it right there i saw many people like on the street officers yeah they curry just curry and also when sometimes they say like oh this it isn't illegal to have a shortcut your hair and then i kept my hair short yeah that means you know every time you get caught on the street and you know take me to the intel investigation room and you know but my father and his friends in our town was a has a power and high-ranking officer so i was released in a day yeah i was lucky but yeah but i think i think myself why i did why i did that at the time i think i i thought to myself that was the only way i can show my anger to the government yeah it's a very small way of resisting yeah because i was young and i have no power but still i feel like angry to the government yeah and every time i made them troubles and my father you know he thought oh he was very worried about my future because if you uh refuse the government says we know or what what's going to happen yeah so therefore my father at that time my men my my father heard that i was selected to the pleasure squad he wasn't happy with that yeah but i i think he was very worried about me and he finally he said like you should call you should go go to the president's cup i made i made troubles all the time he was tired of you know yeah so and then the officers from pyongyang uh after i signed up the paper he told me that from now on you need to take care of yourself right yeah don't hang out with the people and don't fight right you cannot get a scratch on your face right and then yeah exactly and then he says like you have passed the examination so you might get infection from the others yeah and one month ahead to go to pyongyang i was working at the mayor's villa my hometown right [Music] oh it's a just serve for the uh officers so you mean waitressing waitress yeah so you're serving like at the restaurant okay okay that's correct yeah interior this is fascinating what i mean you know that this kind of job is a prestigious job and i mean north korea of course yeah in north korea i know people don't get it here right like in north korea if you go anywhere that feeds you three times a day that is a big deal anywhere you go you can get fed for like right ah that's just crazy things so you were so now let's go time back you so how about how many people in your family were you the only child oh i have a younger sister oh you had a younger sister and so at 16 you were selected to go to pleasure squad yeah and right before you were about to go to pyongyang and and then what happened uh and i because uh at that time i have so many friends like soldiers and businessmen like because i work before i go to work in the mayor's villa i was working in the restaurant like a luxury restaurant and i have so many friends and therefore they was worried about that and also my my dad want me to go to mayors villa because i made the troubles made troubles all the time yeah so therefore i started to work in the mayor's villa but once i got into the villa oh my god the facilities was so lavish was that wow and the government lifestyle is just luxury and you know and i felt like oh my gosh they have lied to us for our entire lives and i was cut completely cut off from any life outside the villa oh really yes so didn't let you guys go outside the villa was located in the mountain i don't know where this is unbelievable yeah so i was so lonely and i was i felt i was in prison i was a free spirit before i came to the villa and i couldn't deal with it therefore i escaped the villa i mean how many of you were there like how many of the girls are each time training to go to pyongyang there oh that's only only me i would i worked all by myself oh my god that's scary i mean yeah but there's uh some like special chefs and other cleaners yeah but we dress only me i was the one wow so you escaped from that villa and how did you find the home i'm sure it's like in the middle of mountain where nobody knows right i i walked mountains for two hours and once i found the heron city and you know my home was a little far away so therefore i slept on my friend's home yeah and once i woke up and i was oh i'm ready to go to school to see my family and my friends actually she was worried about me because i escaped from the villa and that's why she went outside to you know find out what's going on and she came back to me and she said you know what you can go to see your family right now because its borders were blocked by 400 soldiers and intelligent officers were searching for you everywhere she said because you escaped from the villa they thought you're escaping to china i i don't know at the time i didn't really know that that was a serious crime i didn't know i'm i committed a serious crime sherry oh my god so what you're like 16 year old years old a teenager that's that time 17 years old you're by then you're 17. right and you were you about to go to congress yeah um soon and i i just didn't feel like i go to pyongyang because you know i couldn't bury because i cannot live with that without seeing my family relatives and friends therefore forget about that this is it i just escaped from the villa and i didn't know i made a like serious crime you know yes it's suddenly i became a fugitive and criminal wow yes and and that's how they're motivated to escape eventually that was the moment i realized that there was no hope for me to in this country and i was a hopeless therefore i decided to escape to china so i wanted to know so here young is like of course like it's known to have beautiful ladies right here is known for the beauties from north korea and and i how about the other part so in i'm like north korea is so isolated right we do not have the freedom of movement we cannot really go to see next town and what's up there and was was it hard in hand to do like a lot of like the street kids like godzilla's and a lot of those that in here young too yeah yeah a lot of godzilla were on the street and also like many people died on the street so that was you guys also suffered from those famine and poverty and starvation yeah my friends my friends walking on the street finding food in the garbage yeah yeah oh wow so now you're 16 and in 2001 you're trying to escape how did you find a way to escape to china yeah you know my hometown is close to border china right this is a river of one river right yeah but i can not escape in my hometown because soldiers were looking for me therefore i i need to go to different cities in order to escaping from north korea but in our hometown is close to the border very very like there's a wide post there i need to pass to the quad post so i was in the uh generous car in the trunk yeah to pass the really yeah in the trunk they they hit me in the in the trunk and then there was the generous car so you know just passed through safely also you knew people who are like helping you out to escape my friends and then also soldiers i have so many friends there so they helped me to yeah pass the quiet post and they were therefore yeah i escaped china safely was it summer time did you have a stream or like it was winter it was uh around in april oh my god this was the river must be so cold yeah i was like i'm sorry that that's a second time first time was around uh end of september oh no i i now i just heard you said the first time so you escaped north korea more than one time jerry how many times do you use this kid life is tough life is tough business yeah once i escaped china i thought it's a over yeah i made it yeah and at the time i didn't really know what like life in china and i heard from my friends people captured in china and they sent back to north korea but i didn't really know so once i i captured in china and you got captured in china yes yes how soon how long after you escaped after in six months oh so in six months you're in china with your friends and you got captured yeah i got captured in china and i don't know what to do you know people if we have experiences being sent to north korea they say oh i'm going to take this i'm going to take this but i didn't even take money at all and sent back to north korea and yummy have you ever ever experienced that send back to north korea no i i didn't i met the other defectors in china and they told me if you get captured just kill yourself they told me they beat you they torture you they rape you i mean they're gonna treat you so horribly they said like if i ever gonna get captured they were saying they were going to kill themselves so i always knew like it's better to kill myself than being capturing some back north korea it was so but even in 2001 the treatment was that horrible i know now it's really bad kingdom right but was it still bad back then still bad yeah it was still bad and i didn't really know about what prison lives look look like yeah and but once i uh arrived into north korea and oh my god i felt you know i already have experienced freedom in china and suddenly all fears you know overwhelmed me and you know i i was so scared and and i you know my my case was different right like i was chased by the soldiers and intelligence officers so i was so scared and if they call to my hometown and they will find out soon but luckily i cannot in security for my relatives i cannot mention the city but i was lucky my relatives was a general in prosecutor in that hometown so i got released quickly and my father and my relatives saw me and they was just shocked my my appearance what happened to you i had my hair dyed with orange color oh my god and then i wore the fancy clothes and therefore they think oh you know what we need to use the yours your car so generous car i went home safely by generous cars yeah so i think i was lucky i still have a you know bad experience in prison but i was lucky than others so you were like tortured and like at the time i was too young i don't know also they all yeah they torture young kids too but now they do yeah they even send teenagers to prison camps but i heard all the time like when they got into the investigation room like i can i could hear the sounds like screaming you know right yeah it was a horrible experience for me and at that time i knew i realized that my father used to told me prison life prison life yeah prison life in when he went to uh sent to when he was in the prison and he his experience were worse than me yeah so it was a it was a horrible experience i one uh intervention center yeah yeah yeah just uh from morning to night you need to sit there yeah all the time from i don't know how many hours you need to sit there it was very hard time for me yeah and anyways i once i got home safely but the thing is i couldn't go out i had to stay home all the time so i told my dad father i need to escape to china okay okay okay you know you know i can do anything in this country you know more than me i need to escape to china and my father he was just speechless he he didn't say anything for yeah a few minutes and he said i knew yeah you can't do anything in this country and therefore he said he took me to the border helping me to across the truman river yeah how did you you had already people in china who were helping you out oh i have a friends and also when my father's did business i used to call them uncle like that but but i didn't i don't know why but i didn't really call them and help me something like that i i didn't really look for them yeah but then like how do you survive in china because like usually north koreans go there we don't speak the language we don't have the id oh it was a hard time for me too but i still have some friends there so i didn't really like i didn't sort to chinese people yeah i didn't have experience that but yeah still in order to survive there that is that not our country we were illegal to live there so yeah i still had a hard time to survive in china but yeah i didn't sort to chinese people that's good did you meet other women who were sold when you're in china no i didn't i haven't yeah because i i didn't actually meet any north korean people in china yeah that's because we are all hiding you know if we tell people we hear each other you know we hide in ourselves exactly we don't get really scared of anyone finds out that if we are north koreans yeah there's no way we can say in north korea in china everybody is a holiday i i didn't yeah you see any north koreans in china how long were you in china uh after one year my family also fled to china so yes so we have been uh there for three years old as a family yeah or together yeah and we had actually few chance to go to south korea really but at the time um we wanted to go to us you knew us we wanted to immigrate to the united uh united states but at that time u.s they didn't um take north koreans as refugees so we were just waiting and my father was tired of waiting he said oh i need to go to south korea therefore my mom and my dad left china first and she told me my and my sister i will take you to korea i will come back soon to take you to korea and he left china he left to search for freedom and we were waiting for my parents to return but we didn't know that was my father father's last words he he never he never came back for us my father uh during idiot's journey to search for freedom he he died in laos and [Music] so he died while he was trying to escape he died yeah he died in laos and was buried in mekong river that was a really hard time for me and my family my sister and me we didn't know so we were waiting for my parents to return and i saw news that america accepted north korean people as refugees yeah as soon as i saw news i told my sister we should go we should go to thailand to immigrate to the united states therefore my sister yeah therefore my sister and me we left china to go to thailand and we we went to the u.s embassy as to asylum why did you want to come to america like why not south korea i mean how did you know like about america because in north korea we learned that america is our enemy is a horrible country right that's a good question you me that my father influenced me a lot he once he after he released from prison he knew everything and they treated prisoners like an animal they are national human beings and he told us that this country is not normal country this country there's no hope for your generation and this country is corrupt by the dictator and he told us that there's only north korean people can be free the only way is the united states start to war against north korea other than that yeah he said because there's a yeah he he all the time he told us that so that's you knew that you had to go to america and i like i asked to myself like because i couldn't choose to born to choose to be born so there that's why i was born in north korea but what if what if you can have second chance to be born and which country you want to be born yeah that was the america that was the united states for me yes so i just saw oh this is the chance to immigrate to the united states so yeah i went to the united us embassy as to asylum to the united states and they were shocked i was the first first one north korean refugee you know come came to the u.s embassy for asking like immigrants to the united states and like six to seven soldiers with the gun and came to us and they searched over my our bags i had some you know um or something yeah and i once i arrived in thailand my mom told us that my father passed away away died in laos yeah oh i i was sent to the emergency room more than twice oh i didn't like i don't i don't know like i didn't know how how am i going to live without my death and i still feel like a guilty of my father's death because of me and you know all the things happened and yeah i completely understand that i i mean the exact same thing it's not your fault you know i think we all ask that questions north koreans because we have been punished for our birthplace so much we always like we didn't choose to be born in north korea nobody chooses that yeah and this is this is injustice and but you fought with your life to be free and you came to america so was it shocking i don't i can't even imagine from china not going to do sasha and coming to america were you what was your impression of america when you came here i can't you know forget still the first time you know just well once i arrived in the united states for the first time since i left to the villa i could sleep peacefully my nightmares are being caught yeah finally andy that's uh you know i couldn't forget and when i get my green card and i was so thankful because now i'm a citizen like i i you know i'm a citizen in the united states and i have a country who can protect me yeah yeah that was her that's only i put my life in danger to search for freedom i remember uh me too like i came to america i saw those homeless people right and i thought in the past like if you're american citizen that is the biggest thing in life bigger than even meaning the lottery right all right all we wanted all we wanted in china was that id being a country like having a country that protects us and then i couldn't believe it in america people were not happy being american i was like what's wrong with you even i've been here for so long i i still don't believe it i don't know
