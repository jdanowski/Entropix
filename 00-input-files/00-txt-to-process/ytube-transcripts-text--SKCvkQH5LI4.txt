The trip to North Korea (part one) Salam Alaikom In the name of God, the most gracious, the most merciful. In this small series I will show you scenes from one of the most mysterious and isolated countries in the world. The country that I entered with questions, and leaved it with even more questions. and we might wonder whether stories we have heard about NK are true or not. Actually, what I saw in NK with my own eyes made it easier to believe most of these stories Of course there are a lot of exaggerations and misunderstandings. I spent 8 days in NK visiting most of the places there. Pyongyang .. Hamhung .. Wonsan .. the east coast ..the boarders ..  etc.. 8 days in the 2nd century according to the Juche calendar used in NK 8 days in a complete disconnection from the world No telephones, no internet, no newspaper, no outside T.V channels and before we start I would like to clarify that NK is not one of the 5 countries that is banned for Saudi citizens. You can always contact the General Directorate of Passports and they will answer your questions ( General Directorate of Passport's reply) I have started the journey from China from Beijing to be more specific I was asked to attend an appointment one day before the trip this appointment was compulsory to understand the laws and regulations and to sign on a paper confirming that I am not a journalist and that I am not a missionary and that I will respect their laws, their leaders, photos and monuments basically they don't want to hold any responsibility some of these laws were humorous and frightful at the same time they change continuously from time to time especially after unpleasant events in January last year, a foreign tourist named Warmbier was sentenced to prison for 15 years with hard labor they have accused him of doing "hostile acts against the DPRK" he got arrested at Pyongyang airport where the cameras showed that he was stealing one of the propaganda posters hanging on the wall of the hotel at the same hotel, and the propaganda.. or to be more specific "boasting about NK" showed pictures of different sizes mostly showing the victory of the Koreans and the defeat of the imperials an American being stamped on and a Korean solider crushes the Pentagon etc.. these are the only posters that you can see in NK the only country in the world that does not have any commercial ads on the way to the airport, I have received my visa it was a separate paper card the entry and exit year date was written in the Juche calendar that started from the year which Kim ll-sung was born as for the months and days they were written according to the Gregorian calendar there was no stamp on the passport and they take it from you as soon as you arrive at Pyongyang and they keep it with the controller until the end of the journey Declaration should be made on the number of books, mobile phones, computers and you have to enter/exit the country having the exact same quantity which you declared earlier without leaving anything behind a foreigner once forgot the Bible in a public area and they sentenced him to prison for 5 years as for the prohibited items it includes: books, movies in Korean language, the bible the U.S.A flag in all forms, pornography, GPS devices, latest addition of GoPro camera lenses more that 150 mm and the list goes on After that they took us on the side to examine the books, mobile phones, computers a passenger once was faced with a serious problem because of a picture he had on Whatsapp that was sent to him as a joke as for me, this book got their attention thankfully Stalin's picture on the cover saved me even though it's just a novel, but it literally describes a lot of  what's happening in NK thats why I made sure to bring this book with me these are the streets of Pyongyang it is noticeable that cars are rare to find only 3% of the population own cars mostly owned by teachers, scientists, doctors, high ranked military officers and personnel as for the rest, like what Al-Motanabi (Arab poet) said: " and some, with their daily bread, content.. using their legs to ride, and their own skin for wear" in 1974 NK bought 1000 Volvo cars from Sweden and they still did not pay its amount yet these cars are still roaming around the streets of Pyongyang until this day, this ambassador still claims for his right a reason why there is a Swedish embassy in Pyongyang after we left the airport, we headed to to the capital one hour before sunset it was my first time seeing the people of Pyongyang the capital of NK, or the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) we can't name it NK after this point first day in the capital Pyongyang we headed to one of the Metro stations we went into a deep, long escalator for a couple of minutes there was Music coming from unknown places we arrived to a white elegant hall with a soviet layout and golden inscriptions and poles with rectangular frames showing the newspaper behind a glass cover the hallway was covered with beautiful mosaic paintings showing the soliders, farmers, builders or "workers" as the regime likes to call them foreigners are only allowed to visit two stations connected by a short lane there were lots theories in the western media that the metro was just a trick or an unfinished project and those passengers were just actors it is also alleged that there are secret tunnels connecting between the headquarters of NK and there is a lot of evidence and witnesses but we certainly can not investigate or even ask about it 100 meter underground, Pyongyang metro is considered one of the deepest in the world that's why it conserves a permanent temperature degree throughout the year plus, it is also nuclear resistant the controller and I went into a trailer,  it was crowded and I chose to stand so I could take some pictures I was warned  from aiming the camera lens directly towards the people's faces this is one of the most beautiful pictures I took I wrote the story of this picture on my Instagram account at the end of the day I went to the hotel where foreigners can stay in located in an island isolated from the rest of the capital and it looks depressing and ambiguous it's famous because of the rumors that had been told about it what really caught my eyes is the world map located at the reception all maps are represented like that in order to place Korea (North and South)  in the center and they always talk about South Korea like its under their sovereignty even if you asked a North Korean about the population he would say: "50 million" where he includes the population of the two countries The hotel gave me the room card it was thick and strange and they were very careful about it foreigners are warned not to stop between the 5th and the 11th floor no one knows what these floors are about especially the 5th floor which did not have a button in the elevator the furniture was old-fashioned it was strange that there was a fire detection device located at the corner of the room despite the fact that it is always recommended to place it at the center of the room and there was a hole in the device directed to the window at the hotel, there was a small library that sells books explaining the history of the country in their point of view and in all languages including Arabic there were books about the leaders, and previous editions of Pyongyang times this is the library let's take a quick look "no photography allowed" but the library manager is talking on the phone I hope she doesn't see here is Newyork ti... I mean Pyongyang times similar to Newyork times and other newspapers we know you can notice here the way of folding the newspaper it can only be folded here and here it can not be folded on the geat leader's picture because that will cause some problems I am not sure if I am going to save this video I should not point my fingers towards him like this It is also prohibited to throw it after reading it there is an authority that deals with such documents here are books that talks about Korea's leaders in Japanese, English Dutch, Spanish, Russian, French in all languages here are some of their sayings this is Kim ll-sung, the grandfather of the current president *translating the quote in Arabic* that's him on the left and his son it is prohibited to point your finger towards him like that you must use your whole hands like this These are some published books about Korea map of Korea Geology of Korea you can notice that they don't write north and south they don't acknowledge such names the official name of the country is DPRK even when they talk about South Korea they would talk as if it's part of their country I was just in the elevator with a little girl with her parents she asked me where did I come from I told her from Saudi Arabia but they didn't know it so I showed her on the map where Saudi and NK is she got angry and told me that it is Korea and not North Korea these are photos of the great leader Kim Jong un after he got re-elected the only candidate indeed all of them voted for him mashallah and you can see his famous hand clapping after he won the elections and here is his speech after he got re-elected * reciting verses of the Quran* thanks for watching subscribe to the channel for more videos
