[Music] welcome to reporters plus here on france24 in this special edition with fishing quotas a major point of discord between france and britain right now we're taking to the waters on the other side of the world for a report that reveals international intrigue human exploitation and illegal fishing that is dangerously depleting fish stocks in fact there's just no way of knowing how many fish are caught illegally by north korean fishing boats but what we find out in our report is the existence of a fish smuggling and supply network that breaches international sanctions fish taken from russian waters by north korean ships that ends up in china and in the middle of it all a woman who it's claimed is close to the north korean leader kim jong-un much though is not quite how it seems no one knows the size of the north korean fishing fleet no one knows how much it catches and as you'll see in our report evidence washes up quite literally on the shoreline near vladivostok our reports by elena voloshin and ian [Music] there are now thousands of them every year on rickety old-fashioned wooden boats they venture out to loot the fish stocks of russian and japanese waters they are north korean and ill-equipped to cope with the high seas sometimes they get shipwrecked as much as 500 kilometers from home foreign we spent months investigating how north korean poaching is organized and trying to find out why this ghostly armada from the hermit kingdom is invading the russian far east is a deep sea diver lately he's been finding a lot of these drift nets in the water us research is on top of the danger to divers there's the threat of an ecological disaster these nets spanned in russia and numerous other countries can be several kilometers in length and the north korean poachers just dump them after use [Music] what happened to the crew and how in these hardwood vessels with their plastic propellers did they even get so far up the coast in vladivostok there's a researcher who's been following their movements for years professor virtuslav dubina studies the processes that impact marine ecosystems using satellite imaging economy the professor also wants to show us the vessel's home ports in north korea on the board agni [Music] it's hard to say exactly how many boats make up these impressive flotillas if the russian state knows it's not publishing any figures [Music] yet it's in the bays and coves of russia's far east coast that the north korean poachers seek refuge in stormy weather international conventions mean russia is obliged to grant them access if they're in danger in olga bay 450 kilometers from the north korean border it's the start of the pacific salmon fishing season make their second trip of the day to check their nets barely 10 days ago the north korean flotilla was at anchor in this bay they came last year too and the year before today is meager everyone here says that since the north koreans have been coming to these bays fish and seafood stocks have shrunk [Music] drastically as indigenous peoples of the far east these men are given fishing quotas which vary from year to year this season it's one to two hundred kilograms of salmon per person coast guards are stationed here to make sure no one goes over their limits attribute the fishermen are all the more angry because of the north korean poaching are these allegations fair seeing our camera the coast guards come to speak to us we keep it rolling and ask them a few questions [Music] the coast guard insists that the situation is under control when the north korean boats are in the bay but out at sea he says it's not so easy [Music] [Music] last year though the coast guard stepped up operations out at sea these images were filmed by the fsb its parent organization the north koreans fished for squid all over the 200 nautical miles from russia's shoreline that make up russia's exclusive economic zone they also catch crabs the russians sometimes use force on the 17th of september last year a fight broke out the official version is that the poachers attacked the coast guards who returned fire four coast guards were wounded one north korean killed after long negotiations with the fsb we finally got permission to film the captured boats sailing out there with the coast guard under their surveillance seven steelholed north korean ships are being held off the town of nahodka about 200 kilometers from vladivostok our communication with the coast guards is kept to a minimum they're not supposed to speak to us and we have to blur their faces but we're intrigued by the presence of north korean crew members on the ships and we try to ask our chief escort about it foreign foreign from what we can see of life on these boats certain details attract our attention the presence of women for one and the fact that the crew members use sea water to wash themselves with [Music] we want to find out more about their detention conditions [Music] we return with the translator and approach one of the boats [Music] another [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] but the sailors especially this man who seems to be the captain are wary [Music] they will say no more for organized poaching in the russian economic zone they face up to five years in prison [Music] most of them though will be deported meanwhile in nahotka another group of north koreans are about to go on trial for a more serious crime this man is one of 161 poachers arrested on the 17th of september in the clashes with the coast guards along with 17 others he's charged with their attempted murder it is our presence that has sparked this move from the chief investigators we are shut out of all the hearings over the first two days of the trial as the court considers the north korean poachers provisional detention from their rubber boots and dirty clothes it looks like they have not been able to change in the 10 days since they were arrested some of them are limping one man even has his leg in plaster yet the official account of what happened did not mention any north korean wounded our translator tries to speak to them they're afraid to answer us according to our sources the coast guard shot them in the legs in response to their attack their appointed lawyers don't seem overly concerned about their condition unlike most of the other lawyers who avoid our questions stephan schlick agrees to an interview he has defended north korean poachers before he says this time the only thing his client has told him is that he wants to go home to north korea [Music] in russia they face life imprisonment were they under orders to defend their ships and their take at any cost they do sometimes pay an even higher price for their poaching [Music] vladimir korokovsky owns one of the town of olga's two funeral parlors here in the local cemetery he has already buried two unidentified north korean fishermen no dna tests are done before the burials so there is no way to ever know who he was vladimir organized these funerals at his own cost [Music] [Music] how many poachers have died along the russian coastline [Music] russia does not publish a tally both moscow and pyongyang act as though these people did not exist [Music] korean fishermen from a sinking ship in a storm gennady and his wife took them into their home a journalist from a local tv station shot these pictures residents of the village did what they could to help the man gennady's wife natalia says the priority was to give them first aid beyond [Music] why do these men risk their lives to go fishing outside of their country to find out we travel to the other side of the korean peninsula to china and the border town of dandong it lies at the mouth of the yalu river which separates china from north korea further upstream the sprawling north korean city of sinuiju gradually gives way to rural landscapes life here seems stuck in a bygone era [Music] um our chinese guide is well versed in the habits of the mysterious neighbor's opposite his family has lived on this border for generations foreign our a moves us to a safe distance and then explains food so is the military in charge of fishing in north korea [Music] back in dandong we confirmed this information with other sources here goods agents and business people cross back and forth daily across the road and rail bridge that links the chinese and north korean banks of the river despite a raft of sanctions adopted in 2017 by the u.n security council which include a ban on north korean seafood imports trade between china and north korea continues to prosper and it's in dandong that we find some clues in our investigation we managed to contact an agent who sells fishing permits for chinese ships on behalf of the north korean government our translator who for security reasons we will not identify pretends to be interested in buying one of these permits to prove he's serious the agent even sends him pictures of a woman he says is his north korean aunt standing beside the country's leader kim jong-un he comes to our translators hotel room we filmed their meeting with a hidden camera foreign the agent then explains the procedure ultimately the agent invites our translator to a meeting with his famed aunt her office is on the top floor of the building next door it used to house the north korean consulate the agent proudly shows off the view across the river to north korea on the wall hang the pictures of his aunt with kim jong-un and here is the aunt herself the conversation with her focuses on the question of money [Music] foreign selling its fish foreign to china north korea earns hard currency which its economy desperately needs and has been deprived of by the sanctions [Music] before they came into force in august 2017 pyongyang exported nearly 200 million dollars worth of fisheries to china each year that is now banned but you wouldn't know it from the main market in donggang just south of dandong here there's north korean fish and seafood aplenty [Applause] channel in the local jargon the eastern sea means the north korean zone but when we ask him about his permit this tradesman gives only vague answers [Music] some buy produce out at sea sold directly by north korea whose impoverished fishermen have been reduced to poaching [Music] others by permits monthly ones to go fishing in the nearby north korean waters in the yellow sea or annual ones that allow for fishing in the north korean zone of the sea of japan on the other side of the peninsula a lot of the permits are sold here in the port province of shandong a major hub for seafood production in china overfishing has gradually emptied its gulf of the bigger fish that have the highest market value [Music] [Music] foreign every month this entrepreneur imports nearly 260 tons of fish from south korea in shandong 75 of fish production is farmed the rest comes from imports and above all from fishing abroad [Music] to take us to the nearest port to show us the open sea fishing vessels some of them bear a startling resemblance to the north korean trawlers we saw in russia [Music] wanted to buy a permit to fish in north korean waters in those days the local fisheries authority even organized a lottery foreign nevertheless is not planning to go fishing in north korea anymore it's too dangerous too risky you have to finish foreign [Music] [Music] to preserve its fisheries whilst continuing to sell them to china north korea sends its own fishermen ever further afield [Music] these pictures were given to us by the japanese coast guard last year they turned back more than 1 500 north korean boats [Music] on the russian side an agreement signed in 1987 allocated north korea annual fishing quotas [Music] but they were suspended in 2018 [Music] this area of the pacific ocean boasts the richest fish stocks in the world but overfishing means it is emptying out year by year not least thanks to complex poaching systems beyond the control of humanitarian or environmental monitoring [Music] and our report was a co-production with arte thank you for watching it see it again of course via our website france24.com this is reporters stay with us
