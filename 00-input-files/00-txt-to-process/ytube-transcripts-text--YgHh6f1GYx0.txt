journalists kept under close surveillance to go to North Korea is to accept the presence 24 hours a day of guides who are guarantors of the country's good image fill this 15 the law must be respected yes we do not allow French journalists to go out alone our country North Korea does not like the French why because they took part in anti-north Korean operations there never were any French operations against North Korea but in Pyongyang's eyes every foreigner is a potential enemy who has to be closely watched it's the sworn duty of each guide to chaperon the visitor and regurgitate the regime's propaganda even these official North Korean guides may not be filmed during our stay we will be confined to our pyongyang hotel with absolutely no chance of being allowed to go out into the city unaccompanied mr. Han guess what are we going to do with what now I'm going for a stroll where he's here in the hotel yes in the hotel maybe you could go into town No [Music] having spent several hours wandering around the hotel lobby we finally get authorization to go out any trip is pre-programmed and serves the objectives of the propaganda machine the house where the founder of the nation was born reminds foreigners of President Kim il-sung's heroic deeds and helps to affirm the families legend revenge was 14 years old the president left his native home man Jong Dae firmly determined both return before Korea became independent since then the president led the trend year long arduous anti-japanese arms travel tour shining victory and finally liberated our country hundreds of North Korean soldiers are taking part in a mandatory pilgrimage to honor the eternal president's memory from the grandfather Kim il-sung to the present incumbent his grandson Kim jong-un the leaders are as one in official pronouncements we now have participated Commerce teams only as a worshiper and commander he is exactly like the president gave Esther and the great general kim seung-yoo in his ideal leadership and instrument so our Korea will always emerge victorious in the future too under the wise leadership of the respected marshal Kim [Music] we've been given authorization to visit Pyongyang to film the Capitals latest infrastructures the authorities are keen to airbrush the image usually associated with this country a totalitarian regime a family dynasty and brutal repression this shiny brand-new Hospital is exactly the sort of publicity the regime wants on the 3rd of November last year marshal Kim jung-un visited our hospitals he was very happy he said he felt like he was walking into a palace look at that chandelier up there that is our emblem it represents a woman's bust this is the room which our glorious leader Kim Jong hoon visited on the 3rd of November come in this is the bed the marshal sat on when he came here he asked how long the patient's stay here kirito-kun up and marshal kim jeong-hoon sent us this 42 inch television the day after his visit so you sleep here is that right you're a patient here yes do you speak French a little what a stroke of luck the first patient we meet and she speaks French how much longer are you going to be staying here in some a week should be enough I think wearing her hospital clothes this patient is giving the performance of her life in this well directed play [Music] is that a power-cut but reality soon kicks in again do you often have power cuts no very rarely the hospitals employees do their best to remain unmoved by such events nothing can tarnish the image of the country and those who run it boom Jujubee so Mike that as I said to you this morning our country is at loggerheads with the USA Japan and South Korea the cause of Yahoo so we need a strong military many soldiers to defend the fatherland there is always tension in the Korean Peninsula and commander Kim jong-un is very young bloody bloody sea listen to me he has declared if our enemies dare to light even the smallest fuse of a war like you Korea will strike a lethal blow which will definitively unite the country reunification of our nation is the most fervent wish of every Korean they're gone [Music] this desire for reunification dates from the end of the Korean War in 1953 when the peninsula was split into two countries but no peace treaty was ever signed officially the two Koreas are still at war North Korea was subsequently run by Kim il-sung until 1994 and then by his son general Kim jong-il who died on the 17th of December 2011 [Music] you [Music] Kim Jong Un's son of the late Kim jong-il has been in power for three years in life or in death the Kim dynasty's power over 24 million North Koreans endures [Applause] the Kim family is the first communist dynasty in history the new incumbent was presented to the people as a natural successor barely 30 years old Kim jong-un was quickly awarded the titles of supreme commander and then marshal and said about consolidating his power Kim Jong Un's accession to power gave birth to a new hope in the hearts of the North Korean people more of a modernist than his father he built theme parks and was accompanied at public appearances by his wife know North Korean leader had ever been seen to be so liberal before kim jonghwan cultivated his image right down to his posture which was designed to be reminiscent of his grandfather's propaganda has now established him as the third strong man of the North Korean nation the leader is the country's brain and the people are its body our guide is here to remind us of this shake him the one exacta marshal Kim Jung hoon is exactly like general Kim Jung Il in his human virtues his political leadership and his philosophy likes your politic dance on you do Lucia therefore everybody respects and idolizes him respect I've been there the guides rhetoric is always the same under Kim jong-un devotion to the leaders remains almost religious by call transient foreigners we're constrained by the regime's demands [Music] I've only consider I come before we thought of them as leaders or heads of state all across today now think of them as our families fathers the children or older people Viet nano women that's what is the entire Korean nation considers them to be our fathers the bear in his three years of absolute power marshal Kim Jong un like his father and grandfather before him has become part of the intimate fabric of Korean families this retired scientist and her granddaughter are typical of this devotion to the regime what are your feelings towards the marshal like everyone else I feel that marshal Kim Jong hoon is the embodiment of our destiny he is our future and a father to us all you foreigners could never understand how much we venerate our marshes the whole Korean population places its future and destiny in his hands it is thanks to marshal Kim Jong hoon that I am wealthy and can live like this in fact maybe you know the song or it speaks of the rise of our young nation and tells how our country will be built by the people under the guidance of comrade Kim Jong hoon thanks to him our future will be brilliant and socialism with triumph we're gonna have gone nuts - [ __ ] in yonder watching our Smita how about a song [Music] [Music] no one saw me I'm young so I don't you see either even little children mr. Marshall so they salute him in their songs I knew that your granddaughter who just sang she's 2 years old what kind of future do you want for her what kind of country will she live in Amador yeah how's her to Damian not Anna I feel sure that she will live in a strong and prosperous country that will incarnate the might of Mount big tools that she will live in a world where she will have no cause to envy others not I did Indian Agha or ohon Winnicott she washed ugly so she already goes to a good nurse window upon happened and will go to the free high school and university has his new documents we hope she's going to be a scientist like her grandfather we would like her to contribute to our nation's developments in science and technology under the guidance of marshal Kim Jong hoon paani Anunnaki did you buzz yeah I drove a meter under kim jonghwan the nation's future elite is being coached in Pyongyang's model schools here the children of families close to the nucleus of power will one day become musical virtuoso we teach the children piano but out of 30 pupils only a few will be selected for the national academy of music some will become pianists and others will just become composers or singers [Music] our Junior School gives out these red stars as rewards to children for good work and when they see these stars it also makes them want to join the army [Music] in this way youth is molded to the regime's ideology from an early age and plays a vital role in its propaganda the children have to be adorable their cosseted and well-fed [Music] these are the regime's privileged few the keepers of its eternal future [Music] you [Music] from infant school through to university devotion to the leader seems unfailing but all the parades songs and smiles hide another reality the images that we filmed in North Korea give no insight into how this enigmatic country really works only North Korean refugees who have fled their homeland continuin Lee shed light on the country's everyday life what your footage shows is children who are all at the same level the ones who lead the parades on the streets of Pyongyang are psychologically groomed throughout their time at school and usually they have access to better facilities to go into their parents position because it's a privilege to lead parades like this through the streets of the capital [Music] don't dig up the difference between the kids from Pyongyang and the kids from the countryside is their size the children from the capital are much bigger than the country kids of the same age this is due to lack of protein in their diets nope that's are not now a whole host of new songs glorifying kim jong hoon is being taught to the children and they teach them to us their parents if children sing any song that is in any way critical of North Korean socialism they're censored in front of their classmates [Music] [Music] this indoctrination of youth is an absolute priority at the heart of this education lies a rabid patriotism these children are the future of North Korea and have to be ready to defend their nation these masked spectacles are designed for the North Korean nation to promote its sense of power these 20,000 young participants are all members of families fiercely loyal to the regime [Music] these Pyongyang citizens are an essential part of the regime's rhetoric at its very core students teachers and high-ranking military officers whose loyalty is beyond question these men and women from the Capitals elite are the only people allowed to meet foreigners like the park family a couple of university professors handpicked by our guides the park family's exemplary conduct has enabled them to move into this block of flats doodie yeah I'm still emotional talking to you now we used to live on Manson on hill over there in a flat on the 15th floor of a building where those two statues of our leaders are we were given this apartment on the 2nd of July 2012 marshal Kim jong-un came to visit us on the 4th of September 2012 he looked at every room even the bathrooms he turned on the tap and the water ran freely so he was very pleased did you put lies warm so Jimmy a noise I couldn't believe how lucky I was to be able to live in a flat like this to take our money the easy business when our marshal Kim Jong on visiting us I even asked him dear leader why is it that a family like ours is allowed to live in such a luxurious apartment of always the marshal said in our society teachers and their families are the people who are entitled to the greatest respect if people like you can't benefit from living in a place like this then who can you deserve to live here that's what the marshal told me a model flat for a model family happiness North Korean style is like everything else stage-managed in order to ensure their loyalty and to disguise the iron rod hanging over the population Kim jong-un has transformed Pyongyang into a shop window for the regime's privileged few like my shaking the one I'm marshal Kim Jong hoon is trying to ensure that all our people can enjoy a happy life he wants the people to be able to live in a civilized country a civilised and socialist country it is his will and his intention but the people may one day enjoy a very modern lifestyle but dance I'm old Hakone this shows that we're trying to develop not just the leisure industry but also sports health care and culture unicode's we're trying to live in a more civilized world basically the despot Kim jong-un has decreed the North Koreans should have fun the country has supposedly entered a new era with fun for everyone at least that's the image that the authorities want to display to foreign visitors on the outskirts of Pyongyang this Equestrian Center is marshal Kim Jong Un's latest creation you took my heart AHA this Equestrian Center is for the benefit of everybody workers employees old people and even small children as a single asset of youth car nothing is left to chance there's no room for improvisation oh I'm on my way they want to see the merry-go-round get everything ready quickly and let the others know we're on our way currently in this the horse symbolizes North Korea's power if you believe what the North Koreans say the Kim family comes from a long line of horsemen the legend surrounding the supreme leader continues Suzuki Ong seal between 1990 and today marshal Kim jong-un got on a horse 300 times advised and coached by General Kim jong-il he worked very hard at it in order to become a great horseman he studied and read many books which enabled him to master every aspect of horse riding that's why he's such an expert now the myths surrounding kim jeong-hoon borders on the grotesque indoctrination seeps into every aspect of life our presence here serves to export this ultra propaganda across the country's borders but all the journalists it has a bottle the role journalists play is very important that's why we're taking the documentary you are making of our country so seriously expect that I found out more we hope that you will take what we have told you and turn it into a fair and objective documentary as objective a tab part of the schedule for the day is a visit to marshal Kim's latest folly a ski resort 200 kilometers from Pyongyang his time studying in Switzerland gave him a taste for winter sports the regime has spent 300 million dollars on the construction of this complex but Kim jong-un has also achieved his objective of circumventing the embargo on leisure goods imposed by the international community giggles all of us news we have ten ski slopes here at the Masek resort I'll give a nine for professional skiers and one for beginners we started building these slopes in May 2013 and we finished on the last day of December 2013 that's what the marshal required and we achieved it our leader even promoted our resort all over the world all segi radical Masamune schism what is a little Superman Spartan goofy customer penalizing Kunal top skiing is part of our country's culture and so Kim jong-un wanted this resort built to develop our civilization but who in North Korea can afford the luxury of a holiday here no one is willing to explain the circumstances of their stay here hoodie immunity as the resort was designed with the people in mind and the prices to have been set with the people in mind who is a disco in marshal Kim Jong Un's socialist country money remains a taboo subject only 5,000 North Koreans are estimated to have the means to use this resort in the opinion of this North Korean refugee these new facilities are unacceptable jung-hwan lan-evo Kogi Bob rip tdawg as commandery bizarre because it's all so ridiculous people are starving to death and these facilities are only for rich people from Pyongyang and no good to anyone else the reality is the people in North Korea are suffering you ha anyone on you tell me when I see all these leisure facilities being built I think to myself that it's just to placate the people's and show people abroad that the country is capable of achieving these things all the money spent on building these things could have been redistributed throughout the population this is just throwing money out of the window North Korea's economic difficulties do not stop the regime from spending money hand-over-fist every two years Pyongyang puts on a film festival open to foreigners [Music] this is a way for the authorities to present an image of cultural and material prosperity to the world [Music] we declare the 13th Pyongyang International Film Festival open the films and cartoons shown all follow the party line of course this amine ability towards the world outside North Korea is limited and tributes to the leader are never far away this event is all the more important because it only takes place thanks to the interest and the love that marshal Kim jong-un has for the cinema you're about to watch films which are completely innovative in both form and content North Korean cinema has a central role in the propaganda machine it educates even before it entertains [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] the Film Festival also allows the regime to present itself in a good light a message relentlessly driven home by the Ministry of Culture we want independence friendship and peace between peoples all over the world yes all over the world a select group of dignitaries and a few foreigners are being treated to a soiree orchestrated by the great and good of the regime [Music] [Music] but behind this facade of a smiling prosperous North Korea the regime maintains control over every citizens life [Music] one semester a customer ironical Hawaii tomorrow you go to another one into them resolvable a photo see they form about all the way dr. Joe Thank You Santa [Music] in this country of supreme leaders even the smallest event is an opportunity to pay tribute to the leadership under North Korea's totalitarian system there is no other choice [Music] to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the end of the Korean War the population of Pyongyang is requisitioned to pay tribute to its army general Kim Jong Il's said to safeguard our country one can live without candy but one cannot live without bullets as our guides words are directly influenced by the song gun doctrine devised by the former leader Kim jong-il which gives the army the dominant role in building North Korea's socialism like his father kim jongwan perpetuates the tradition of large public parades in this way he sets the scene for his own power and that of North Korea [Applause] the army is the keystone of the regime with a million North Koreans enlisted and a third of the population reservists [Music] picanha elegancy go to Ontario van Sigma da good he's on it these grades are quite remarkable I think they used to do something similar in the former USSR what all there was what leaders Kim il-sung and Kim Jong Il taught us was a style of military marching called the hell March which dated from the end of the war with Japan it's a style that Kim his song was already using when he fought the Japanese to unlock it the idea is to intimidate the enemy when you do a hopping goose-step like that it's rough on the stomach Koo Yong Kumbakonam current era gana sakala Rida Madonna when we trained we were told to wear two leather belts done up very tightly under our belt there's on the unequipped it this pushed up your stomach I thought you could you can imagine is very painful crocotta okay to get on I got a meal Danny Saucedo Kato I took part in training with these grades while I was a student at Military College jet Saratoga not one but a few days before the parade I contrasted paralysis in my legs because of the hopping so I was unable to take part and had to go back to college the training is extremely hard it felt like being a prisoner in a labor camp and in North Korea not to be able to take part in the parade is very shameful ha ha in order to establish his authority over the army and the party kim jonghwan took his inspiration from the darkest days of Stalinism in december 2013 the young dictator began a violent purge of the state's apparatus any officials who could have got in his way were brutally eliminated beginning with his own uncle Jang song-thaek who was very influential at the heart of the regime humming - gin mill wagons and people took the special military tribunal of the Ministry of State Security of the Republic of Korea has found the accused Jang song-thaek guilty of acts of subversion against the state chump up t his goal was to overthrow the power of the proletariat by aligning himself with our ideological enemies this crime carries the severus penalty under Article 60 of our penal code this up star this traitor to the revolution is condemned to death the decision is to be implemented with immediate effect Jang song-thaek was shot according to the party line for fomenting of coup d'etat he was said to be overly immersed in commercial activities with China any hope of the regime relaxing its approach was definitively snuffed out Kim jong-un has asserted himself Castle warlord his frequently bellicose directives are followed to the letter by North Korea's soldiers after the Kim jong-un regime took power training became more and more intense he was determined to crush South Korea by force he was very insistent on the weapons we had to use and ordered us to use all our ammunition on every training drill in blow global go anger double remember the directives changing when he took over we had to go up into the mountains more and more often for training sessions two or three times a week and already buttoned on it and everything changed from a military equipment point of view we got new and better munitions like armor-piercing bullets the tunnel would I think Kim jong-un wants to prove to Koreans that he is capable of preparing the country for a war against South Korea ha our marshal kim jonghwan regularly challenges his southern neighbor and enemy the regime's belligerent rhetoric goes hand in hand with provocative acts such as nuclear trials or military maneuvers the state needs an enemy to justify the economic priority given to the military this policy operates with no regard for the population which outside Pyongyang is still vulnerable between 1994 and 1998 the country suffered its worst ever famine which caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people at that time I was a soldier and I had some serious health issues I'd lost a lot of weight I remember that opposite my barracks there was a woman who used to deliver food to the Labour Party cells I went to see the farm manager and pleaded with him to give me some apples I said give me an apple before I starve to death so he said you can eat what you like when you're here but you can't take anything with you otherwise all the other soldiers will end up coming here and your superiors will confiscate your food I lived on an apple in the morning and an apple in the evening for several months nowadays there are no great famines but lack of food is still the main thorn in the regime's side a third of the country's population suffers from malnutrition and is dependent on a public food distribution system [Music] litter shed the lapel DB saw the state by cereals and other foodstuffs from the farmers at a low price a deputy ba and then redistributes them among the population depending on the number of people in the family they get more or less food toned and more is given to families where there are adults the regime is still incapable of feeding its people but is keen to convince us that the opposite is true our journey now takes us on a visit to a naturally exemplary farm Tony Allen's and these are the details commemorating our visits from general Kim jong-il who came 15 times to give us new instructions his advice when he was here enabled us to improve production he doing it he was very pleased the general said at first the soil here was bad but the good work of our farmers has allowed us to increase productivity General Kim Jong Il himself said that our farm should become a model to the rest of the country this model farm looks more like a ghost farm according to the manager 850 farmers work here we do not see a single one this dilapidated green house is the regime's attempt to convince us of how modern its agricultural system is dejenne kakum kin bacho D in fact what we produce here is mainly for the local population we don't get involved in how many people we distribute vegetables to didn't cheek blumenbach Sumida tons of Capon one back off there is an organization above us that calculates this and then gives us production targets for the year Wichita services you can go visual [Music] but the targets set by the authorities are unattainable in order to help the farmers the regime takes its inspiration from the Maoist model and sends the army into the fields as soon as our training is over we go into the country to work with the farmers bow-legged we usually help with pricking out rice or planting corn every regiment is billeted to a farm near its barracks to be long hung the commanding officer might say this barracks you go to this farm or whatever after the corn harvest at the end of October or beginning of November we return to barracks to start our winter training in March 2012 Kim Jong un introduced a reform which allowed farmers to keep half of what they grew but a lack of fertilizer and farm tools prevents the country from being self-sufficient and this fundamental principle remains out of reach the regime seems to continue supporting a systematic economic path but today it no longer has any choice but to tolerate private commercial ventures well not to show that if you take on Dominican me we still struggle economically there are still obstacles to overcome but under our Marshalls leadership everyone can enjoy a stable lifestyle the regime has succeeded in maintaining this stability by cutting off its population from the outside world only a handful of North Koreans managed to get around this isolation via the black market when I'm in dogged therefore can she's on her smugglers who regularly cross the Truman River on the Chinese border and bring back contraband I went into business with a bunch of friends and I remember everyone copying and burning South Korean DVDs brought in from China and then selling honey market in North Korea buying DVDs like this is expressly forbidden and goes against the regime and the law it is actually dangerous to even own them but there are fewer controls in the evening so people get together around 10:00 or 11:00 and stay up until dawn watching recordings of popular TV series I remember a very popular South Korean series which showed a casino in a capitalist country you saw money changing hands which we'd never seen before though and Eliza because all you see on North Korean television is documentaries about Kim il-sung and Kim jong-il and it's still the same today but in those South Korean series I saw apartments and wardrobes both clothes and shoes the North Korean regime keeps on telling us that South Koreans are very poor but the people in those series were really fashionably dressed and I loved it according to these refugees this new merchant elite could be the catalyst for change within the country this may explain why control over the population has increased since Kim Jong Un's accession to power North Koreans have absolutely no chance of leaving the country legitimately so despite the risk many try clandestinely to cross the border into China from total Kissel Russell chinguga and poodle coterminous all the first time I fled North Korea I met a missile man when I arrived in China and was sold to a Chinese farmer a chunk o : Keegan today picanha on Chinese soil you're considered an illegal immigrant and not a refugee boy it means a Torchic upon each wheel so we now cut I ended up getting caught and the Chinese authorities sent me back to North Korea Sokol gigas Ortega I was sent to a labor camp for a year come on Godhead quail I was beaten for three days for two years the first few days are meant to frighten you and make you confess your crimes tricking Bazan's are a new component once you've confessed you're sent to a labor camp or to prison which me that I'm done jail whoa good it's all--it's when they were torturing me they prevented me from sleeping to God and they hit me here in the I go okay so anti biggie Jim young its highboy unicorns origin when I was a border guard on the two men River who is that it was my job to catch fugitives boy wizard an alchemist army we were posted along the Chinese border in groups of three we'll be good tomorrow along with our government when we caught a fugitive we took them to our guard post where we recorded the time and date at which we captured them then the fugitive was interrogated by our boss and transferred to the Department of security if the prisoner was starving we could be lenient otherwise they were sent straight to prison or the labor camps all I did was hand them over to my superiors we were rewarded for each fugitive we caught Linda Dee Madeline good single I started out eight people from escaping across the Tumen River into China if you catch one fugitive you get a medal if you catch five in the same year the Labour Party Awards you prizes I'll even holidays so that you can go home and see your family ding dong any tiny turnover on the dong dong Yi dynasty [Music] how do I get in though with a bag on his side go go Amy once I left prison I wondered how I was going to carry on living with no identity I know amici I was considered a traitor to the nation so I had no future in North Korea could there calm again I tried to flee a second time your luck sir to come ahead obtained contact details for a people trafficker while I was in prison when either your love with his all thanks to him I managed to cross the two men river between China and North Korea he took money and don't got us all with the fake passport he made me your gun I got on a boat to South Korea the following day thomna in turn you get immunity thoughts I guess a the ruthlessness of the regime and the disastrous economic situation have forced over 200,000 North Koreans to flee their country 25,000 have made it to South Korea despite some early hope Kim Jong Un's accession to power has not changed the nature of the regime never before has the contrast between the reality of this country and the image it tries to portray being so glaringly obvious
