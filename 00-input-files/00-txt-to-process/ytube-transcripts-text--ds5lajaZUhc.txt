South Park season 21 episode 2 scoot it down hello everyone Stevie here I'm back with another self part review of all the farts I may be a few Phoebe's of course because that's what I do here I think we recorded miss there lincom ton of natural disasters and bad stuff up and all over the world so my thoughts good to anyone is suffering in any of these crappy situations at the moment here's hoping they pass and hopefully they can use things like South Park to bring themselves up a smile on their face on bath time and hopefully everything gets better but let's go on to the story this week revolve around tweet which was great tweet is scared to death of North Korea and why wouldn't you be the episode starts out school town shore where tweet comes out and plays a scary song about North Korea it's like conceptual music it's really weird just you just play the piano and screaming about we're gonna die he's trapped now but North Korea's me to my no one's doing anything about it and this shocks everyone making the next competitor karai at launch after the short while Cartman is run into Craig about Serena's mono and having balls in a relationship we see that he is actually still with Haiti Eric says that she threatened to kill herself which is pretty dark Cartman where you go of this Craig goes to see tweakin tries to calm him down he convinces him to do something nice for the North Koreans to try and chill the mode tweek cause I mix them some cupcakes in the hope of akut school we thank tho though it was actually currently who threatened to kill himself not hey Stan gets the voicemail approval which he pleased everyone I mean he's got this under the premise that he wouldn't tell anyone but he instantly goes to all the boys and plays them it cost Cartman is in the room they're all laughing at him apartment is pretty pissed off we got a quick flash of North Korea with some strange but great music Kim jong-un receives the cupcakes let's hope for some peace eric has no pissed about everyone is laughing man but he spins this into people not caring about suicide he wants an awareness campaign but solving for Cartman it is currently a distracted driver Awareness Week Cartman says he is going to compete with this next one Eric real real nice beaks cupcakes make the news the North Koreans receive that kim giman loves them and starts making his own cupcakes but just when everything seems cool the president supposed to be in towards North Korea saying that he knows the skin tweet auntie probably crap in the bar too weak is no you know Craig tries to calm them down but it's been a thought garrison just keeps treating stuff oh I do not think the spinner is gonna be enough in this situation Cartman starts competing with a destructed driver campaign with his own campaign he has an epic song but we quickly realized that this is not about suicide prevention it is about attention forever and his song he also manages to completely buried for Heidi I'm threatened to kill himself a very specific time Eric it's not cool but it is bloody hilarious as bad as years this is Cartman are his best the market Ian's launched a missile orbit week six in retaliation tweek crops a big time no spinners can help over this one we get a brilliant Tomeo from not to be in use ruin I mean this is awesome I would love her to be on this channel for some videos that would be like a dream gar listen it just makes things worse by tweeting out more and more insane and racist abuse - worst of the North Koreans which you can see on screen all the tweets name / tweek tweek doesn't need this back at school the kids are all sad Cartman thinks this is for him but it turns out it's full of pure innocent tale called garlic Barca Vic who has been killed by a distracted driver pretty graphically is annoyed by this he tries to rage a PC principal about his own situation but this crap just does not work with PC principal Cartman just good mental says he's taking his horse to the street Eric is now in a full-on self-absorbed a wanker mode it's brilliant we then got a hilarious news report about how North Korea planning to attack tweek including their plan B which is dropping an anvil on ax men pistol alias Craig tries to calm em down he's gonna take it with a fair I mean this shoot help don't know that amusement park should help with any situation we got a Cartman who is on the street campaign and he asks attic if he would like to talk to the other kids check Mary's website you also have suicidal thoughts and it could get ugly Willis and thinks that they are all attention seekers and this is not about every other kid killing himself it's about him and him alone and because she told everyone he was going to kill himself he a no has pressure on him to do it okay Alec that's some crazy logic he's got there but it said it Cartman what do we expect another kid is tragically killed by a distracted driver this time rating from the Cartman while Steve on him just making them more on their little hilarious bastard that he is tweek and Craig thought that means apart but sadly garrison tweets out that tweet is so unafraid of the North Korean regime here's a bear that's why I wasn't any other abusive and racist tweets which we tweaked out obviously but it also leads to a lot of kids being run over because then not if with the kids being run over is that they are all distracted by the tweets of the president a lot of kids get run over in the park by dodgems other things that shouldn't be able to kill kids but it does South Park and it's a president's fault Craig tried to come down tweek at this point but it just does not work tweet just passed the point of anyone's I come and then which annoys Craig I always tweet in the Oval their separate ways a bit what if they're back at school we see the kids who are trying to raise awareness where the distracted driver campaign in the dinner room but Cartman steam goes in before they can really do anything on twice to make their awareness campaign which compared to his tidy in front of everyone who starts question and Eric which leads to a big argument for tuna teeth but xform an office Ian I just got so fair here at this point just brilliant Drake goes to see tweek but this time rather than trying to help them give him advice he just lets him over the arc and gets the thoughts out of his head which works and for the first time I think ever we seem to be copy on-screen I'm not jittery and I think even I've learned something here I mean I think we could all learn something from this moment I feel in the relationship it's a good moment to watch this all led to the end of this week's episode the episode just came down a pop they finished in my opinion but that's another story for another day to finish with an epic musical number style and pretty much everyone in South Park trying to raise awareness for the destruction driver campaign basically to blame for all the destructive drivers killing kids is placed at the president under non-stop tween and the song is pleasing to everyone if you ever become a president you should put down your phone and stop tweeting so as a hammer without one I absolutely love them it was such typical South Park's satire done brilliantly a normally the way they can't do it and this is why they are some of the best art satire on South Park and at the very end of the song Cartman just pops up and says he's okay no he's not gonna kill himself yay and that was at the Sawtooth threw it down so this was good I thought it was really really good as of last week's episode this is the so far three in one love and the shift back to the stale episodes that some people were missing last season we only have a very loose ball one from last week the narrative with Heidi and Cartman continues but we see no alexa i was hoping to see her this week but I had a hunch that they may not sure that Alexis thought for a while just to dump him down the hole serialization thing and I hope that she will return and that would be a surprise for everyone that's what I hope that's what I think let's hope that happens we seem to have reached the end the serialization within so far although I am NOT saying that is totally stop my prediction is that we will have a season-long story of sorts but there are a lot of complaints and feedback that people that didn't like the whole season being one story of things I think that broke it down back into what South Park used to be but they're gonna still fall over on you just not add the episode I mean there are things that for the one I mean goddess and pistol president Heidi is still the Cartman and that whole abusive relationship thing is going on so I think we are gonna have absolute time into each other just not as much as it was last year very like if you missed one episode of the season you missed a big chunk of the season my only criticism of this episode is the gardens in it as president and they're using that narrative again although not as much a little last season but they are kind of backed in a corner Biff this one unexpectedly to everyone Trump got more than a thousand so now they have to use Dallas in this president and you can't be sapphire without doing this sort of stuff so in the end it all worked very well you can't other said you can't make this a failure without ripping on the easiest targets and politics you are like Trump and Kim Jong on tompa's garland so it's just the way it is I hope we see more Kim Jong and in the future because it was funny didn't talk but it was funny to see Kim jong-un on screen and he's actually absorbs not like desired was which is just like a photograph or than we've the most and I do think Alexa is gonna make a return soon because departments got all these issues he's called us issues were Haiti and we know for a fact it back at his house he as a roomful of the basis I'll do whatever he asks so I don't think this story is going anywhere this is my prediction I do predict that this is gonna happen but here if I'm wrong I'm wrong this is what predicting is all about I'll be back next week for more and please subscribe to the child on all that stuff that would be very cool time a student and that would be helpful very quickly it's not to end on a negative the real talk there's a lot of suicide talk and stuff that like and this research sort and I have to say this suicide there's a real really shitty thing which affects a lot of people every day if you know someone who seems like they're gonna be heading this way then please reach out to them and if I the homework just try and get them help life is precious and at the end of the day the suicide mainly many people suffer because one person is not listening to you or not reached out to don't let that person be your friend under once often in the youth reach out even if you don't know the person that well because sometimes all someone needs a somewhat dr. Hartman you're busted you shouldn't be using that cause but that is Cartman to a tee anyway other said more South Park next week I hate leaving on a negative so I will leave you with a semi funny story in this episode it was given a dizzy spinner because he's a long just person to try and get rid of this anxiety or just keep him busy no he personally reveal I operate it and I'm I actually seemed busy spinners never like coupies my Eisley stopped me the gym cuz I fidget so I got fitness trainer um it really worked for about five minutes but but then I got bored of it their irony now put some smiles on your faces people I'll be back next week with more so far I'll see you all that
