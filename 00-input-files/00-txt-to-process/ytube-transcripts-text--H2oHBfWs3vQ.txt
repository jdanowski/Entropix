if you see behind me we're going very far down one of the deepest metros in the world on North Korea the breaking news welcome to Pyongyang in the last video I gave you my first impressions of the country and we're actually only halfway through the first day here but I want to show you more now and show you the rest of the day to everything we're doing here and basically document as much as possible of being in Pyongyang [Music] did yet [Music] [Applause] we're in the pock now it's just the loads of local people don't sing with one lady singing and I was so transfixed by a filming it [Music] a so interesting today in this park just seems to be in an outhouse where you go dancing everyone else is just sitting having a picnic watching people dance it's a real sort of family celebration [Music] Oh [Music] ever we got no Priya nice pants tons of me [Music] okay next up we have the chance is gone the Pyongyang metro which has two lions and 17 stops I think we're riding three stops on it I just get to see it and experience it a little bit [Music] if you see behind me we're going very modest metros in the world the reason is materials have just been told one because it goes has gone underneath the river which means it needs to be pretty deep because it doubles has a bomb shelter as well so we're getting pretty deep underground [Music] so like I just said it cc-come Shelton these not applause this three COAS coast protects the underground path these are the two lines terribly I think we're going on this one it's now so I'm gonna wait for the tram they have to shout so as you can see these stations a very grand they have chandeliers and they're huge walls and I just found out they were built by the Soviets and Soviets gave the money so a lot of these were built pre-1991 I think this one was 1987 and I think there's two new months that have been built up in North Korea but most of it was built during the Soviet era [Music] okay so now we have the chance to go up shooting Jett tower 150 meters high we can pay five years to go up to the top and see a big view of young young [Music] [Music] it's the next up we've come to the party monument and this is another really famous landmark here in Pyongyang I saw one of those things that I've seen you know I've seen photos of but now being here it really hits home that oh yeah I mean young yang it's very it's very very large [Music] next up we're going to a department store that is young at least we haven't can't take any photos or video to subside without I'm not allowed to take the camera in at all I'm gonna be in there for a bit so I'll tell you what it's like after so to buy anything in the department store we had to exchange Chinese RMB into the local North Korean currency and then use it whatever were how much we wanted to buy an exchange it back before leaving because we're not allowed to take it out of the country it was actually quite a standard department store in my opinion there was a food court on the top where we had a couple of beers there was a middle floor with clothing on and then the ground floor was a supermarket where you could buy some North Korean snacks and that is about it we're just all so now about to grab some dinner so I'm going inside now and we're here at this North Korean restaurant [Music] okay this is my which is another drink I'll have a try thank you it's not here right yeah it's like hmm interesting it's fermented rice wine and I think it's actually pretty strong but every winery taste any sort of taste is still fermenting buzz [Music] [Music] back to the hotel now really full-on day and leaving tomorrow on a plane I think we can have a few drinks here in the hotel tonight with the people that came on this tour and I want to give you some flavor thoughts and stuff I've learned about North Korea while being here okay the last thing I want to address in this video is just answering the most common question I've had since I went to North Korea because it's a couple weeks later now and I'm still catching up putting these videos out but people have been asking me what the trip was like and the main thing that came up is the people were surprised that you can actually travel there as a tourist and currently there's like four to five thousand tourists going per year and it's actually surprisingly easy by applied for a company called Young Pioneers and the links are in the description below they sort out your visa so I just sent a copy of my passport and they arranged the whole visa and you just pay a set amount depending on how long you want to go so I did the three-day one which was 500 euros and then they go up in cost depending on how long you want to go but I think there's a five day eight day and ten day maybe they run these tours every month and it's not the only company that does it there are others as well but as tours each month so if you did want to go to North Korea you basically just arranged it for a tour company join fifteen other like-minded people and go together that's I think I might do another video about like how I travel to North Korea about more just more details about that and about the visa and stuff I just wanted to say that so you guys know that's how you can anyway for now thank you for watching and see you in the next video [Music]
