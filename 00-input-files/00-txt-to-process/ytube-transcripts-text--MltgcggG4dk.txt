>>> WE ARE MOMENTS AWAY, JUST  FEET AWAY, FROM WHERE THE ACTUAL LINE OF DEMARCATION IS AT. PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL BE THE  FIRST TO MEET WITH A NORTH  KOREAN LEADER AT THE DMZ. THE MEETING COMES DAYS AFTER  TRUMP TWEETED HE WOULD LIKE TO  MEET HIM ON HIS TRIP TO THE  DEMILITARIZED ZONE FOR A  HANDSHAKE. WE EXPECT PRESIDENT TRUMP ANY  MOMENT TO COME OUT AND IF GOES  TO PLAN, AS DESCRIBED BY  PRESIDENT TRUMP, WE EXPECT KIM  JONG-UN ALSO TO ARRIVE AND THEN  THEY WOULD HAVE AT LEAST A  HANDSHAKE. WE SEEM TO BE GETTING SOME  INDICATION IT'S ABOUT TO HAPPEN. LET'S GO TO RICHARD ENGEL AT THE DEMILITARIZED ZONE FOR US. AS WE LOOK AT THE PICTURES, WE  SEE IT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. PRESIDENT TRUMP IS GOING TO COME OUT AND LET'S LISTEN IN. >> I NEVER EXPECTED TO MEET YOU  AT THIS PLACE. >> YOU ARE THE FIRST U.S.  PRESIDENT TO CROSS THE BORDER. >> MOVE, MOVE. >> CLEAR. >> THIS IS A GREAT MOMENT. >> BIG PROGRESS. TREMENDOUS PROGRESS. >> MOVE. GO, GO. >> CLEAR. >> THEY'RE GOING STRAIGHT. >> HOW DO YOU FEEL? >> HE WALKED ACROSS THE  DEMARCATION LINE, MAKING HIM THE FIRST PRESIDENT TO DO THAT. >> -- REALLY EXPECT IT. CAME TO JAPAN AND WE CAME OVER. I SAID, HEY, I'M OVER HERE. I WANT TO CALL CHAIRMAN KIM. WE GOT TO MEET. AND STEPPING ACROSS THAT LINE IS A GREAT HONOR. A LOT OF PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE. A LOT OF FRIENDSHIPS HAVE BEEN  MADE. AND THIS IS, IN PARTICULAR, A  GREAT FRIENDSHIP. I WANT TO THANK YOU. THIS WAS QUICK NOTICE AND I  THANK YOU. >> SO, WE'RE GOING TO GO INSIDE  AND TALK A LITTLE WHILE. AND A LOT OF REALLY POSITIVE  THINGS ARE HAPPENING. AND I'M GLAD YOU COULD BE HERE  TO SEE IT. TREMENDOUS POSITIVITY. REALLY GREAT THINGS ARE  HAPPENING. IN A LOT OF PLACES. WE MET AND WE LIKED EACH OTHER,  FROM DAY ONE. AND THAT WAS VERY IMPORTANT. >> THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU. I WILL INVITE HIM RIGHT NOW, TO  THE WHITE HOUSE. >> THIS IS A GREAT DAY FOR A LOT OF -- IT'S A GREAT DAY FOR THE  WORLD. BEYOND NORTH KOREA, SOUTH KOREA, IT'S A GREAT DAY FOR THE WORLD. AND IT'S AN HONOR FOR ME TO BE  HERE. THANK YOU BOTH. >> I HAVE TO SAY, THAT WHEN I  FIRST BECAME PRESIDENT OF THE  UNITED STATES, IT WAS GREAT  CONFLICT IN THIS AREA. GREAT, GREAT CONFLICT. NOW, WE HAVE JUST THE OPPOSITE. AND IT'S MY HONOR. AND IT'S THE CHAIRMAN'S HONOR. >> I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THIS  OPPORTUNITY TO EXPRESS MY GREAT  HONOR. >> ALL OF THIS TOGETHER. >> AND HISTORY WAS MADE, AS YOU  CAN SEE THERE, PRESIDENT TRUMP  MEETING WITH KIM JONG-UN AS WELL AS MOON JAE-IN, THE PRESIDENT OF SOUTH KOREA. AND KIM JONG-UN SAYING THIS WAS  A MOMENT IN HISTORY, THAT A U.S. PRESIDENT HAD CROSSED OVER AND  WAS IN NORTH KOREA FOR THE FIRST TIME. AFTER THEY HAD THAT SHORT WALK,  THEY'RE NOW ON THE SOUTH KOREAN  SIDE, IN THE BUILDING, ADJACENT  TO THESE THREE BLUE U.N.  BUILDINGS. WE'RE NOT SURE WHAT THEY WILL BE DISCUSSING. BUT DURING THIS ENTIRE MEETING,  WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN PUT  TOGETHER LAST-MINUTE, ACCORDING  TO WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAYS, IT  TURNED OUT TO BE A HISTORIC  MOMENT. OUR CHIEF FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT  AT THE DMZ, HAS BEEN WATCHING  THE LEAD-UPS TO THIS. RICHARD ENGEL, YOU SAW THIS, YOU COULD NOT HELP BUT THINK OF A  HISTORIC MOMENT, THE U.S.  PRESIDENT WALKING ACROSS THE  DEMARCATION LINE THAT YOU HAVE  SO WELL DESCRIBED TO US  THROUGHOUT YOUR REPORTING. >> Reporter: THIS HAS NEVER  HAPPENED BEFORE. TECHNICALLY, THE UNITED STATES  AND NORTH KOREA ARE AT WAR. THIS DEMILITARIZED ZONE HAS BEEN IN PLACE SINCE THE END OF THE  KOREAN WAR OR IF TWO SIDES  STOPPED FIGHTING. IT WAS BUILT FOR THIS PURPOSE. IT WAS BUILT AS A SAFE SPACE,  FOR HOSTILE PARTIES COULD COME  TOGETHER. MANY U.S. PRESIDENTS HAVE  VISITED THE DMZ. BUT NO U.S. PRESIDENT, UNTIL  JUST A SHORT WHILE AGO, HAS  ACTUALLY CROSSED OVER INTO NORTH KOREAN TERRITORY. WE SAW PRESIDENT TRUMP ARRIVING  ON THE SOUTH KOREAN SIDE,  WALKING UP TO THE PHYSICAL  DEMARCATION LINE BETWEEN NORTH  AND SOUTH KOREA, A SMALL, CEMENT BARRIER, JUST A FOOT TALL. WAITING FOR KIM JONG-UN TO  ARRIVE. ONCE HE DID, THEY CROSSED ABOUT  20 STEPS, EXCHANGED A FEW WORDS  WITH KIM JONG-UN, AS IF TO REPAY THE DIPLOMATIC GESTURE, TURNED  WITH THE PRESIDENT. AND THE TWO LEADERS CAME BACK TO THE DEMARCATION LINE, CROSSED  OVER IT, ENTERED INTO SOUTH  KOREAN TERRITORY AND WENT AND  MET WITH THE SOUTH KOREAN  PRESIDENT. ALL OF THIS, A SYMBOL OF  DIPLOMATIC PROGRESS. ALL OF THIS, TO SHOW THAT THESE  THREE PARTIES, WHO FOUGHT ONE OF THE MOST HORRIFIC WARS OF THIS  CENTURY, ARE NOW GETTING  TOGETHER, IN THE DEMILITARIZED  ZONE, IN A PLACE THAT WAS BUILT  EXACTLY FOR THIS PURPOSE. THEN, IT DIDN'T END. THEY SPOKE TO SOME REPORTERS,  THE POOL REPORTERS, WHO WERE  BROUGHT IN. IT WAS A BIT CHAOTIC AND MESSY. REAL-TIME EVENTS, REAL-TIME  HISTORY OFTEN ARE MESSY EVENTS. AND THE THREE OF THEM WENT INTO  THE -- INTO FREEDOM HOUSE ON THE SOUTH KOREAN SIDE AND ARE  CONTINUING THEIR DISCUSSIONS. THERE HAD BEEN RUMORS THIS WOULD HAPPEN. WE DIDN'T GET A CONFIRMATION  THAT THIS KIND OF MEETING WAS  GOING TO TAKE PLACE A FEW HOURS  BEFORE IT DID. WE DIDN'T KNOW UNTIL RIGHT UNTIL YOU SAW IT ON LIVE TELEVISION,  THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS GOING  TO TAKE THAT ONE-FOOTSTEP, BUT A VERY IMPORTANT ONE-FOOTSTEP AND  BECOME THE FIRST PRESIDENT TO  CROSS INTO NORTH KOREAN  TERRITORY. >> MANY OF OUR PICTURES WERE  FROM THE POOL REPORTERS THERE  THAT WERE SCRAMBLING, AS YOU  WERE DESCRIBING, TO GET EVERY  LAST MOMENT THERE. AND THAT, IN THE MIX, ALSO  HAVING NORTH KOREAN MEDIA, AS  WELL. THIS IS VIDEO THAT WE'RE  GETTING. I BELIEVE IT'S LIVE IN THE VERY  ROOM WHERE THEY WILL SIT AND  TALK, NOW. LET'S SEE IF WE CAN LISTEN IN  FOR A LITTLE BIT TO SEE IF  THERE'S ANY AUDIO WE CAN PICK  UP. >> NOBODY EXPECTED THIS TO  HAPPEN. >> CAN WE HAVE THE PHOTOGRAPHER  COME DOWN? >> I WANT TO THANK YOU. HEAR THE POWER OF THAT VOICE. HE DOESN'T DO NEWS CONFERENCES,  IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T HEARD. THIS IS A SPECIAL MOMENT. I THINK, REALLY, THIS IS A  HISTORIC MOMENT, THE FACT THAT  WE'RE MEETING. AND I WANT TO THANK CHAIRMAN KIM FOR SOMETHING ELSE. WHEN I PUT OUT THE MEDIA  NOTIFICATION, IF HE DIDN'T SHOW  UP, THE PRESS WAS GOING TO MAKE  ME LOOK VERY BAD. YOU MADE US BOTH LOOK GOOD. AND I APPRECIATE IT. WE DEVELOPED A GREAT  RELATIONSHIP. I REALLY THINK THAT WE GO BACK  2 1/2 YEARS. YOU LOOK AT WHAT WAS GOING ON,  PRIOR TO MY BECOMING PRESIDENT. IT WAS A VERY BAD SITUATION. A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION. SOUTH KOREA, NORTH KOREA, FOR  THE WORLD. AND I THINK THE RELATIONSHIP  THAT WE HAVE DEVELOPED HAS MEANT SO MUCH TO SO MANY PEOPLE. IT'S AN HONOR TO BE WITH YOU. AND IT WAS AN HONOR TO STEP OVER THE LINE. I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT DO THAT. I WASN'T SURE. I WANT TO THANK YOU. IT'S BEEN GREAT. SAYING THE FOLKS FROM THE MEDIA, THIS COULD BE A HISTORIC MOMENT, I GUESS THAT'S WHAT IT IS. I ENJOY BEING WITH YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >> THANK YOU. >> THANK YOU, GUYS. >> THANK YOU. >> THANK YOU. >> THANK YOU. >> STRAIGHT BACK OUT, GUYS. THANK YOU. >> PRESIDENT TRUMP, KIM JONG-UN, SHORT COMMENTS WITH THE  PRESIDENT, BEING ASKED TO LEAVE. JARED KUSHNER WITH THE PRESIDENT DURING HIS G20. AND MIKE POMPEO THERE. THE PRESIDENT, SHORT REMARKS AS  THEY NOW UNDERTAKE WHAT APPEARS  TO BE A MEETING. THIS IS THE DETAILS PUT OUT OF  WHAT THEY WILL BE TALKING ABOUT, OR HOW LONG AT THIS MOMENT. WE HAVE, AS YOU'VE SEEN, THESE  PICTURES OF PRESIDENT TRUMP,  WALKING ACROSS. HE STEPPED OVER THE LINE. STEPPING OVER THE LINE HERE,  RICHARD ENGEL, WITH US AT THE  MOMENT, STEPPING OVER THE LINE,  FOR AT LEAST A PHOTO OP AND FOR  THE HISTORY BOOKS HERE. THEN, THE TOUGH STUFF REMAINS  HERE, RICHARD ENGEL. WHAT WILL BE NEXT WHEN IT COMES  TO NORTH KOREAN/U.S. RELATIONS? >> Reporter: I THINK THIS IS  DESIGNED TO BE IN THE HISTORY  BOOKS. AND PRESIDENT TRUMP KEPT  REFERRING TO THAT. IS HE REWRITING HISTORY RIGHT  NOW? ARE THERE CERTAIN ASPECTS OF HIS VISIT, WHERE HE APPEARS TO BE  REWRITING HISTORY. HIS ARRIVAL AND HIS SPECIAL BOND AND FRIENDSHIP THAT HE  DELIVERED, A BOND AND FRIENDSHIP THAT WAS CLEARLY ON DISPLAY,  WITH THE CHAIRMAN OF NORTH  KOREA, KIM JONG-UN. PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYING WITHOUT  THAT BOND AND FRIENDSHIP, THINGS WOULD HAVE BEEN WORSE,  POTENTIALLY EVEN LED TO WAR. THE REALITY IS THAT THE TENSIONS BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH KOREA,  SPIKED AFTER PRESIDENT TRUMP GOT ELECTED. THERE WAS TREMENDOUS RHETORIC  AND INSULT, WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP CALLING THE NORTH KOREAN LEADER, THE SAME PERSON HE IS EMBRACING  AS A FRIEND, BEFORE HE WAS  CALLING HIM LITTLE ROCKET MAN. NORTH KOREA WAS EXPLODING  NUCLEAR WEAPONS INSIDE OF ITS  MOUNTAINS. PEOPLE IN SOUTH KOREA, THOUGHT  THE TWO COUNTRIES WERE ON THE  BRINK OF WAR. THERE IS AN ASPECT WHERE TRUMP  IS NOW CONGRATULATING HIMSELF  FOR EASING TENSIONS THAT HE ALSO HELPED CREATE. BUT IT IS STILL A HISTORIC  MOMENT. IT HAD NOT BEEN DONE BEFORE. HE WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY AS  THE FIRST U.S. PRESIDENT TO  CROSS IN NORTH KOREA. BUT WHAT IS WRITTEN, IS THE WHY. WHY DID HE DO IT? DID HE DO IT TO REWRITE HISTORY  AND PAINT HIMSELF AS A DEALMAKER OR A PEACEMAKER. IS HE TRYING TO DISTRACT? OR IS HE TRYING TO RESTART  NEGOTIATIONS? THIS IS THE THIRD SUMMIT, THE  THIRD MEETING THAT THE TWO  LEADERS HAVE HAD. PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID IT WAS  GOING TO BE A HANDSHAKE. THE TWO OF THEM GOING INTO THE  CONFERENCE HALL. THE CONFERENCE HALL SET UP. AMERICAN AND NORTH KOREAN FLAG. NOT ALL OF THIS IS AS  SPONTANEOUS AS IT SEEMED. NOW, THEY ARE ENTERING INTO  MEETINGS, WHAT APPEARS TO BE A  BRIEF BUT THIRD SUMMIT. >> RICHARD ENGEL, OUR CHIEF  FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT THERE,  THERE AT THE DMZ. PRESIDENT TRUMP, MEETING KIM  JONG-UN AT THE DMZ AND BEING THE FIRST U.S. PRESIDENT TO CROSS  INTO NORTH KOREA. THIS HAS BEEN AN NBC NEWS  SPECIAL REPORT. I'M RICHARD LOUIS.
