[Music] [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] the dmz is located nearby the city of kaesong in north huanghe province if you travel from pyongyang you'll embark on a three-hour journey along the reunification highway or you can choose to stay overnight in kaesong which is just 10 minutes away from the dmz when the border between north and south was originally drawn kaesong city belonged to south korea so during the korean war it was spared much of the bombing that the rest of north korea suffered and therefore also retained many old buildings and structures [Music] [Applause] okay so we just arrived at the dmz where they actually got a new lick of paint there was a typhoon here about um september october time um on the korean peninsula so they did some renovations and there's a new lick of paint which you can see behind me and um yeah so we're about to go to the dmz point which is the north south korean border otherwise known as so let's go and see what it's like so this is often known as one of the world's scariest borders and world's most dangerous borders um i beg to differ i think it's um incredibly friendly and the military guides who take us around are a lot of fun but i'll let you guys make your own opinion of that um when we go in and see what it's like [Music] at the entrance to the dmz are two propaganda posters one saying let's pass on a unified motherland and the other saying the common slogan chelsea korea is one it's not permitted to take photos of the entrance area of the dmz and before you enter you'll have an explanation of the area in relevant history from the military guard who will show you around total length is about 257 kilometers inside of this area nobody can carry automatic weapons and heavy weapons the zone stretches for 250 kilometers or 160 miles across the width of the korean peninsula between the mount kung gang region in the east and the mouth of the imjin and han rivers in the west after the explanation you'll then line up in a group cross the white line and enter the gates marking the entrance of the dmz area before getting back on the bus it's then just a short bus journey to the first stop okay so we just arrived at the dmz the military zone where we are first going to take a look at the blue house where the armistice agreement was signed uh with the us and the people from dprk and afterwards and we will go into a building where we can see that signed agreement as well so let's see what it's like [Music] [Applause] the korean war was provoked by us on june 25 1950 just within one year from the starting of the world the u.s suffered a very serious political and military damage from our so on june 30th 1951 the u.s suggested us beholding the armistice talks on july the 10th the same year 1951 at 10 o'clock in the morning the first talk was held so when we were having a talk um i would like to do this and then you want to used by north korean and un officials to negotiate and sign the armistice agreement these two buildings hold important historical significance and after an explanation in the first you go on into the second building where a museum has been set up the original flags and agreement are under a glass on the table in the center of the room along with photos and artifacts from the time whilst everyone is having a look around i take the opportunity to have a chat with an old friend so we're going to say hi to our military guide so how long have you been working at the dmz about 10 years 10 years wow so you've seen many foreigners in that time money money oh that's very good yeah cool and it's always a pleasure seeing you every time [Laughter] so we just finished um looking around the armistice talks hall and the armistice signing agreement hall which you can see behind me and now we are heading to the blue huts um at the dmz uh demarcation line where we will be able to see the line dividing both north and south [Music] on this drive the north korean flag is visible flying atop one of the largest flagpoles in the world the flagpole was built in the border town of kijongdong one of the two towns allowed to exist inside the dmz there are 245 families that live here [Applause] this area is known as the jsa and once you arrive here you're taken to the signature of kim il-sung a huge marble monument with the president's signature emblazoned on it it's reported that this is a copy of the signature he wrote on his final document before his death in 1994. after this you're taken to one of the most well recognized places in north korea the dmz military demarcation line if you're lucky you may even get the opportunity to head into one of the blue conference rooms and step technically into south korea so behind us um we can see the south so just behind those blue hoods there um maybe you can see um a concrete line and um that shows uh that's the south over there and we are currently standing in the north where are you i'm here so let's go up and see what it's like from the balcony we can get a better [Music] view [Music] very rarely there's also the opportunity to see people on the other side visiting from south korea the dmz is the only place in north korea you can take a photo with a soldier so many use this opportunity on top of the pavilion [Music] there's only one way out of the dmz the same road that we came by so after walking around for about two hours this marks the end of our trip to the demilitarized zone and definitely marks the time to get some lunch [Applause] [Music] you
