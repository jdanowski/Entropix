hello I'm so I can't walking back so the second channel geography video this is own series why talk about geography and the world and stuff and today's joke free video is actually sponsored by Skillshare I'll be talking more about them later it's always exciting when you get sponsored by one of the the big educational sponsors like wow I'm a real channel now right but like a real channel I'm gonna talk about something that is only kind of adjacent to the topic because I wanted to talk about something which always fascinates me whenever it comes up and that is embassies because every single nation on earth has something similar to a capital Canada has Ottawa the United States has Washington DC the UK has London France has Paris do I need to name capitals or do you understand the point I'm sure you do one of the things about capitals you might know is it's usually the location of all of the other countries embassies basically countries need to talk and sometimes it's not convenient for the you know the the US ambassador to fly over to Europe all the time so maybe they should just have embassies there wow I'm explaining a very broad diplomatic concept using very simple terms but long story short you know it's like having a house but in another country there's also for the citizens of that country to be able to see their thing so for instance the Philippines yeah you know a country has a lot of people who leave the country one of the widest di Spurs in the world you know using their embassies is a handy way for the Philippines to keep in contact with this it sends abroad but also so that if another country wants to talk to the Philippines they can do so very easily basically it's a communication tool that's also for people abroad that's also a bit of a diplomatic thing that also can be used as a bit of perplex because let's take Washington DC for example you know think about it the United States is currently the world's logic on me and you know tons of military it's the it's the big boy power in terms of culture a lot of things to the US is the biggest country buy a lot of metrics and therefore you want to make a good impression right like oh they're the big kids on the block want to impress them and therefore if you look at particular you know embassies you're gonna see how they're gonna be quite big for instance the British Embassy you know like people like to say like you know best ally in the world I don't know if that's how both how the US sees it but it's how they UK likes to see things that we're America's closest ally so there's a big embassy that you can't see because there's trees in the way but you can see how they have put a little phone box outside look how cute that is it's the British Embassy in you know Washington DC and because Washington is such a big city I mean because America as a whole the United States of America has more land than really things that do ever right that's kind of one of the defining nature's of the country now you'll notice how there's a lot of embassies that all look kind of big if we go here for example you can see how there's like free embassies next to each other the former embassy if Iran which is kind of interesting to me but then across the street you can see this thing right here this classy architectural building or whatever this is actually the embassy of Brazil I think we can see the flag there maybe right yeah this is the embassy of Brazil this thing next to it this kind of nice building over there Embassy of Bolivia lots of countries even ones you wouldn't expect to have a bunch of overlap in terms of their relations with a country might have big or at least reasonable sized number embassies again it usually is to do if the size of the country but sometimes it's just kind of a big flexor we're saying saying like hey look how cool we are so for example we can take you know the Embassy of Japan is a great example you know Japan is a very close ally if the US and therefore Wow look how nice their Embassy is it's big it's got some Japanese design motives it's got like you know it's really nice in that way but if we take a country that probably has very little to do of the u.s. because it really doesn't have much like foreign policy of its own accord such as Lesotho you can see how Lesotho has a much smaller boat it's actually not much bigger than a regular house it has one car out front it it looks like a residential house but not if you've read the sign it's the Embassy of the kingdom of Lesotho a country that if you live in Washington DC so you statistically don't know where it isn't a map right like it's a it's a it's a thing that you might not know same with like the Marshall Islands for example which I mean the Marshall Islands one of those places where it's like I mean you know like do is that do they need diplomatic whatever they have one it's a small kind of house as opposed to you know things across the street or you know something like India and like look over there you can see how non-stop there is just embassies that are big for big countries and small countries generally are a bit more although as Korea's embassy right they're generally a bit more I guess conservative with how much they spend because small countries just don't have as much money to spend especially on kind of silly things in other countries that they don't really need too much of anyways so we can take a bunch of examples where there are usually prestigious embassies but a great song would be London for example right that London has been the center of a lot of parts of the world for a long time I'd love to make a video arguing with a capital off the waters by the way I don't think it is London but I think it's one of the contenders right but that's not the subject of today's video although you know this is my channel we can ramble on about that forever I'm going she is not - though and instead I talk about the fact that most cities kind of like how Washington has embassy row most cities tend to have embassies that bunch together it's something I find really interesting I found this on a walk I recently did with the you know History Channel actually one of the edges on this channel like we went on a walk and we found a bunch of weird embassies group to group together but you notice how like here's Bulgaria next to Bulgaria is that Egypt ik it could be sit down actually I'm gonna assume it's Egypt anyway cuz I'm bad with flags as we learned from the quiz that look mostly the same but a slightly different like you know it's the pan-arab colors I want to say as well it's cold but yeah you can see how like here there is a Bulgarian embassy which fun fact actually midway through the video any embassy if any you country is an embassy if the entire EU if you're GU country does not have an embassy you can go to any u country's embassy and it's the same kind of thing though they'll help you out they won't say Nair you're not a Bulgarian mate well I mean actually if your country has never see which statistically if you're Bulgarian you probably go to another country's Embassy not the other way around but still it's interesting look here's the Netherlands embassy here's Fiji or the High Commissioner fee Fiji right there the Embassy of Iraq the Embassy of Bulgaria oh it was Iraq not Egypt my bad see don't know the red white don't know the plan Arab colors man well this this is my problem I claim to know geography don't even know that then there's the Thai Embassy and I could list embassies non-stop like here is a rack wait there's there's two embassies of Iraq in London embassy Iraq London and embassy if a rack where do you think this second one is friends huh what a weird thing you'll also notice a bunch of high commissions and trade commissions and kind of secondary buildings like that oh look here's the Zambian High Commission and you'll see this all over the place you'll often even see like four countries that are a bit smaller they can't really afford embassies in the bigger parts of town and having big things like that cuz London is a city with crazy high real estate values so you see how like Greece is a little bit further out here in the suburbs oh you even spot pretty big countries like a Greg example might be Jordans MC I believe so we go to the Jordan embassy the empress embassy of Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in London now if you look at this it looks like a pretty you know like a it's a really nice Eric London but it looks like just a residential house like can you tell it's the Jordan embassy may because of the flag and is I think that's actually it right like yeah otherwise does this look like the Jordan embassy I would say no and as a fun little thing like this because you can go down the list forever right make fun of countries and I don't like to make fun of countries because they just don't have you know much money or reasons to be somewhere that's a mean thing to do however there's one country that's fair game to make fun of right we all know what it is it's North Korea so this sounds like a BS made-up fact but let's head all the way out into the areas that she called Gunners brain London it's so if you care system where it is it's all the way out here I think this is zone freedom that you like we're not talking central London or even like central adjacent London we're talking a little bit out there and then a little bit to the north of there I think it's like up here you'll notice how here is the Embassy of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea if we zoom in there look here's one I did earlier and you look on the road you like yeah this is residential kind of big residential like I mean they're there big-ish houses but they're not nice residential and then you go down further down the street and you're like okay things are better here I mean if you look at this these houses are nice like it's not maybe not be like good enough for a big country's Embassy but sure no no no North Korea are not on the nice side of this street North Korea's Embassy is this building over here I am not joking around with you I am NOT this is really the North Korean embassy you can't probably see it because of the street views on the wrong side I mean like they're driving down this side the road as opposed to that rough side of the road I'm not gonna let you spend my sensibilities and say that the left side is the wrong side but I will say it's very hard for some reason to get on the other side so you can't see closer to the North Korean embassy but still it is literally just a residential house in London that's how expensive London property is that of residential property in zone 3 of London is actually seen as like yep that's the best we can do it's funny because if you look around the back here you can see how this is such a residential house again it it blows my mind that this is real but if you look around the back and you go around the back of the fence it literally looks like a garden like you can there's a basketball hoop and like is this even still part of the embassy it really looks like someone just has a house that they call the North Korean embassy and I don't know I find that wacky personally there's another set of doors back here but what is going on there the North Korean embassies what's gone right there hidden in plain sight like again I if I was working there I'd be quite concerned because I felt like only bad things can happen right I don't know like I I don't look that seems like a security concern a lot of things seem like you can security concern like have you ever looked at like again this this video I want to make for a while is like what is the capital of the world so one of the things I've yeah one of the most interesting things to me is the UN headquarters like when I went to New York the first time which was the first time I went to America actually but when I went to the United States of America for the first time like I know it's weird to see like the headquarters of the world just kind of chilling here on the side of the street like it seems horrific ly insecure that like one of the biggest cities enough just kind of hosts that right maybe that's just me maybe it is agree but my point is is like there's a lot of things that just seem really insecure and that's on the list in my opinion speaking of things that seem insecure or the opposite of insecure let's talk about our embassy shall we so um yeah we could talk about interesting ones all day which actually maybe we should do so here's the thing about Tokyo Japan right who do you think Japan's best allies who do you think wants to make the biggest embassy in Japan to make the biggest impact and the biggest kind of sign in show etc you might be thinking like not snoc the Koreas not China even though they're natural you know like they're close but they don't really like each other for maybe our you know valid reasons know that the embassy that is best located and one of the nicest ones literally opposite the Imperial Palace by the way this is the Imperial Palace in the middle of Tokyo again Tokyo one of the densest most crazy cities in the world look at all these lines like you can't look at Tokyo on a map without being stunningly confused because of how much is going on it's arguably the biggest city on earth by population if you count metro areas don't don't don't get into the comments about largely if you can't build whatever like it's one of the biggest cities on earth if not the biggest city enough and right in the center is the Imperial Palace that's how big for deal this is and opposite the Imperial Palace literally just across the street met at one it's called like itchy Banja averin or something I don't know how to say wait what's the Omni code it's called it literally doesn't say it should bang in Shaban it should baño whatever like this this thing right here you can see how it's the British Embassy right across from there so yeah that's the Imperial Palace back there I think this was taken June cherry blossom season nice but that's the imperial palace back there and that is the British Embassy the number what you're like the most prestigious embassy spotless gives the British because if like it goes back to like the relationship between the British and the Japanese sharing I think I was like the Meiji period like long before their current stuff basically island nations that get along trade and do stuff I think I've hope I've always heard this is a thing fact this isn't a fact though cuz again I like to verify when I'm just saying random knowledge that sounds like it's correct but kind of isn't so if I what I've heard is the reason Japan drives on the left and has trains ring on the left is because the British came in we traded some stuff and we also built rail lines there and Japan then went on to be the best at railways so just saying you know like not only we got this prestigious embassy which we use to advertise our country apparently which is a bit weird to me Oh have you if by the way this is um this is strange to me the UK has like a rather Great Britain has a big advertising campaign you'll see this anywhere across the world where there's like country advertising but it's like food is great craft is it's French safe things are Great Britain so you'll be like I want to go get some craft gin I'm assuming I want to get some craft food I mean like it's food really one of the things you want advertised about London like there's so many things that make the UK great don't think foods on the list though right whatever I'm digressing a lot here but yet really really impressive that your embassy obviously a lot of other countries have their embassies like here's Paraguay Paraguay but I like Paraguay personally but you know if you're a pair of guy then that's fine of me but yeah you can see their embassies nearby it's not as nice as the UK one though right yeah number one embassy Tokyo I'm probably offending someone with that naturally you're not who's gonna be offended if you're a Japanese citizen you know what's up you know the UK and Japan basically the same country another video I did by the way like I just saying look at Japan look at the UK opposite sides of the world but otherwise basically the same country they've got a neighbor to their left that split in half North and South got a drinking you know culture issue just saying I've got an endless list I could talk about some day but let's talk about North Korea shall we because every single captain in the world like any of you go for like Willem Bunter your fire Embassy's there why do we need embassies until um banter you know just in case so yeah they're pretty small mercies generally so that we go through like look around here for example even if you take the uh the embassy off I know like the the United States the the big usually the big dog in any area if you look at the US embassy here it's like a compound it's like bigger than you might expect but it's still not particularly huge right and yeah there's this kind of funny thing we're like countries that don't have a lot of intersection don't generally need big embassies like here's the Embassy of India how much how much overlaps I think there is between Mongolia and India in terms of trade in terms of anything like that is this calm karaoke huh yeah if you work at the Indian Embassy in Allen Bunter I'm jealous that you get to do karaoke after work so that's nice well so this just in the middle of the street I've got so many questions there's a there's a group of schoolchildren going somewhere to the Embassy of India maybe these are the things that keep me up at night you know these are the things that keep you wondering what's actually going on like what is this this isn't a Google vehicle this is like a truck filled of whatever you know I'm you're just gonna get more questions when you go to Mongolia which is fine maybe I should get more Guldur for a video that'd be a great idea see this is this is a wonderful video we're totally staying on track all the time I people like to say to a cat you you went all the way off your train of thought but I say to those people let's talk about the Pyongyang embassy situation because um yeah interesting enough to me at least so here's Pyongyang you know Pyongyang the world's favorite City but um Pyongyang there's a few different embassies surprisingly few actually because North Korea is a very diplomatically isolated country but in spite of that there are a bunch of embassies here they're usually pretty small for reasons that you could probably guess quite easily right but that they're pretty small and there's a surprisingly few of them compared to most countries like in the u.s. the Marshall Islands had a an embassy Lesotho an embassy what about North Korea you asked well here's a map yeah here's a map behind me right now showing how like yeah it's the big countries are there but only and then also some weird ones besides that like the US and Canada notably absent France and Spain notably absent so Germany only has an embassy I think was the East German embassy basically a lot of countries were torn on their approach to North Korea and should they even have relations and it seems as though as a result that the UK is over there I mean north korea has such a nice that way let's let's show you the honor yeah yeah let's let's show you this is I mean after North Korea an embassy in the UK they they spent so much on their beautiful embassy of their beautiful security system after after they spent so much money in the UK it was only fair that the UK puts an embassy there back but yeah you can see how it's like surprisingly few countries Indonesia Indonesia Indonesia they say it wrong or can you say it that way but um yeah Indonesia we've got Malaysia Thailand etc like a lot of Asian countries that are nearby there South Korea and oddly absent Japan notably absent it's a really weird mishmash of countries and it's one of those issues I wish I understood enough to tell you what's gone on there but I can just say countries are very torn on how to deal with North Korea Czech Republic's here man what what is that embassy all about see the like again from street view all of these buildings look so sad right like this looks like a an area that's been bombed or something a little bit like that but yeah we can't see anything of street view cos Pyongyang surprise surprise does not allow the Google cars to roam around there but you can see the Embassy of the Islamic Republic Iran or can we see it no we can't see it we can just vaguely say that buildings exist here and if we wanted to look at them we probably could pyongyang has gotta be all the cities in the world that was like a most interesting right like what what's the deal with that what's the deal of North Korea oh we were gonna die one day they gonna kill us are we gonna take them out for no reason on millions gonna dine in unnecessary conflict these are the questions you should ask yourself while thinking which embassies in the world are most interesting to you leave them in the comments down below so people can learn about those goes off so we have spoken about Beijing which of course big hub for embassies we haven't spoken about Paris we haven't spoken Matt Berlin you know very very questionable city you have very weird history with regards to that like a lot of embassies have to yeah there's a lot of fun situations in the world but we can't talk about them all and instead I can say some something sponsor has to show for it now but yeah Thank You rabbit watching second Channel don't care get out my face
