on october 31st 2019 north korea fired two large projectiles into the sea of japan this latest provocative act by pyongyang came hot on the heels of a submarine-launched ballistic missile test in early october i would say that every test marks a development marks an improvement in north korea's arsenal there are some milestone tests i think that being able to launch a missile from a submarine or any place offshore means it's much harder to track the missile tests were conducted amid a deadlock in denuclearization talks between pyongyang and washington the hanoi summit in february ended abruptly with no deal the working levels talks in stockholm broke down after the north walked out of the negotiations and north korea has recently upped the ante by restarting his country's provocative missile launches almost 20 tests between may and october this year the latest test in october launched most likely from a submarine shows an increasingly advanced and dangerous trajectory of north korea's missile capabilities some experts say this was a game changer but more ominously does this game change mean that hopes for a deal are diminishing does diplomacy still have a chance to succeed and can the world afford to live with the reality of a nuclear-armed north korea [Music] age has not stemmed the pen of 87 year old you jay sick he's spending most of his twilight years reading and writing but not just any writing he now puts down his experiences fighting in the three-year korean war in a memoir he says he doesn't have much time left many of his fellow army comrades have died the others are suffering from diminished memories due to old age the old soldier wants to keep a record of his life experiences so that future generations can learn about the sacrifices of those who fought valiantly in defense of the country the korean war lasted from 1950 to 1953 and an estimated 5 million people died including 40 000 americans there was no official peace treaty so technically the two careers are still at war but until today you still can't quite understand why soldiers from both the north and south had to kill each other when they all came from the same stock spoke the same language and shared everything in common including blood ties [Music] but even today 66 years after the war mr u keeps close tabs and developments pertaining to north and south relations as well as the role of the us in trying to bring about peace in the region he's particularly unhappy that the current denuclearization talks between the u.s and north korea have gone nowhere despite two high-profile summits in singapore in june 2018 and hanoi in february and the war veteran puts the blame squarely on the north korean leader he feels that kim jong-un is expecting too many concessions but offering very little in return [Music] many observers that believe that in spite of the flurry of diplomatic efforts by the two sides they have not achieved anything concrete not even an agreement on the definition of denuclearization the funny thing is after this two of almost two years of talks between north and south korea and the us and dprk and including you know the several rounds of summits between two leaders they even cannot agree on the definition of denuclearization this is uh the result of persistent north korean deception strategy and people not full understanding of what is north korea's we shouldn't take this ring rather of this nuclear diplomacy and we use the same terminology denuclearization but what we are saying the content of denuclearization in south korea in the united states is entirely different from what north koreans are saying we believe north korea denuclearization means dismantling month of north class nuclear program that's it period but north korea used this term denuclearization as a way to reduce american influence in this region donald trump are going first to singapore and then hanoi for summit meetings that was unusual and even for those of us who had decades of experience negotiating and found this odd and unusual we're still hopeful no matter what one may think of the president of the united states one can't help but root for a successful negotiation with north korea to end this threat he has not yet ended this threat and we don't appear to be on the verge of ending this threat after the failure of nuclear talks in hanoi an attempt was made by both the u.s and north korea to hold working level talks in sweden but this too broke down prematurely when the north korean delegation walked out of the talks the u.s described the talks in stockholm as good discussions north korean diplomats called them sickening since then the level of tensions in the region has been rising following a series of missile launches by north korea this year alone north korea conducted close to 20 missile tests which is quite a lot and what is alarming is that at least five of these tests were using advanced missile technology like what is called kn 23 which is a missile system that can avoid missile defense and also submarine launching ballistic measures the technology is designed to be used for submarines which is also very dangerous if you consider that you know north korean subs can travel probably not across the pacific but very far in the western part of the pacific which can pose serious threats not only to japan but also to guam we've seen a series of these ballistic missile tests from north korea in an attempt i believe by kim jong-un to really put some pressure on the united states to remind the united states and the u.s regional partners that their program remains ready to go and that they're still building it maintaining it and testing it old tensions and provocations appear to be on the uptick yet again on the korean peninsula and it's not quite certain yet if the stalled negotiations can be revived so who's to shoulder the blame when it comes to the breakdown in diplomacy we cannot blame just one side because as you remember in hanoi the u.s president trump worked out and in sweden north koreans walked out so obviously you know we can assume that there is a gap between what north koreans want from these talks and the united states one according to pyongyang the fate of any future talks will depend on washington's change of attitude observers see it as a strategy to pile pressure on the united states to come up with much better offer so as to break the current deadlock all of a sudden the tables have turned in favor of the impoverished and isolated hermit kingdom as it squares off against the world's only super power such bold attitudes toward the only super power in the world i think comes from his confidence as a nuclear weapon power the nuclear capability i think provides enormous personal confidence north korea is the one calling the shots and making demands but if you see they have nothing to lose they are fairly impoverished they don't have much of a global trade the economy is not so big they don't have much to lose but they have the nuclear weapons which can destroy a lot of other countries assets so they have the capacity to make the shorts make you know set deadlines whereas other countries around them can't exactly do that because if they do go to war in a very extreme scenario then the other countries are said to lose more whereas north korea well the regime might topple down but the country on its own will not lose much [Applause] among others kim jong-un has demanded that the u.s drops its hostile policy towards north korea he also wants to crippling sanctions on his country to be lifted in exchange for the progressive dismantling of the north's nuclear program on the other hand the u.s will agree to remove the sanctions only when the north gives up its nuclear weapons program they haven't seen a lot of things with clarity but the bottom line is they want some exemptions or relaxation of sanctions in return for uh some of the actions that are classed here by dismantling a few nuclear or missile sides they just want some relaxation and sanctions the u.s does not believe in that idea so it's again a conflict of ideas about how to achieve the end goal of denuclearization as a battle-seasoned war veteran mr yu isn't hopeful that the impasse between the polarized expectations of north korea and the u.s and her allies south korea and japan can be resolved [Music] after two high-profile summits no deal and very little results to show for what's preventing washington and pyongyang from simply walking away what's keeping hopes alive 2017 it was the year of heightened tensions between north korea and the united states that year pyongyang conducted the country's sixth nuclear test with the hwasong-12 it was an intercontinental ballistic missile with an estimated range of 4500 kilometers the u.s military base in the pacific island of guam was within its striking range what followed was fiery rhetoric between kim jong-un and donald trump the u.s president threatened fire and fury as well as the total destruction of north korea he also called kim jong-un the rocket man in turn kim jong-un reminded the u.s that he has a nuclear launch button on his table as he deliberated over a missile attack on the u.s island of guam in the pacific kim also returned the name calling favor by describing trump as president evil and mentally deranged they talk about the the fire and fury kind of thing the turning soul into a sea of fire all kinds of language which is hyperbolic which is incredibly aggressive and threatening that's unusual that just goes to rhetoric but beyond the bluster kim jong-un strategically took advantage of donald trump's brinkmanship and political rhetoric to strengthen his hand and when president trump came out swinging kim jong-un used that to his advantage you know in order to justify spending so much money on nuclear weapons when you're a country that has so little you need a threat you need rhetoric you need to have the president of the united states directly threatening you and your country and that gives you the rationale and the justification to pour all that money so it worked perfectly into the plan of action that kim jong-un had to test that to get the testing to the point where it was a verifiable threat and so i think he very strategically used the rhetoric the fire and fury of 2017 the threats from president trump to perfect his program but in a dramatic break from u.s foreign policy both president donald trump and kim jong-un met for a historic summit in singapore to kick-start the process on the denuclearization of north korea it was also held against the backdrop of the much improved ties between north and south korea and that paved the way for the trump kim summit in singapore in this administration we have seen a dramatic shift from fire and fury the year of 2017 to a year 2018 when we had the sometimes called too flippedly the love fest of singapore and the engagement of the chairman and the president so personally despite the blossoming of the so-called bromance between trump and kim and the conciliatory return after months of belligerent rhetoric by both sides no substantive gains were made at the singapore summit the same was true for the february summit held in hanoi since may to october this year north korea has conducted close to 20 missile tests south korea and japan have behaviorally condemned these tests yet the biggest military ally the u.s has been muted in its response towards pyongyang's latest antics what is most important for him is to maintain his achievement of becoming the first u.s president who ever met the leader of north korea and hopefully the first u.s president who achieved the resolution of the north korean nuclear issue that has been around for 30 years and many previous u.s president was not able to reserve it so that's why president trump keeps saying that you know north koreans are only testing short-range missiles that's okay that's standard everyone does that on the domestic front mr trump is also facing a bitterly divided congress and he's now looking at a possible impeachment trial the democrats have accused the president of abuse of power they have alleged that mr trump has pressured the ukraine government to discredit former democratic vice president joe biden a potential rival to the president in the upcoming 2020 u.s elections it could be problematic because yes kim jong-un has good relations with trump also the claim but pushing don from too far might just backfire too because donald trump yes you're right in a very vulnerable position the u.s china trade war has also been dragging since june 2018. despite numerous rounds of negotiations no trade deal is in sight and with the november 2020 u.s presidential elections very much on his mind mr trump will need to show political victories to help boost his re-election bid his vulnerability on the domestic front may impact his administration's handling of the north korean issue here we are folks [Music] [Applause] president trump's political vulnerability inside the united states is one of the reasons why north koreans giving a deadline here in deadline to united states is not a good idea it seems that president trump doesn't have much of leeway in becoming flexible in terms of demanding north korea's dna creation you know if he does that if he becomes flexible then he will be faced with more criticism inside the united states so he cannot afford to do that but what north korea seems to want from this year year-end deadline seems to be that you know u.s should be more flexible about eating sanctions even before north koreans get around to the new creation which is a very difficult demand i think after the korean war in 1953 to about the mid-1970s north korea and south korea had about the same gdp but since then pyongyang economy has remained close second time and backwards today north korea's gdp per capita is one thousand three hundred dollars compared to south korea's thirty thousand dollars so how is north korea able to afford its growing military and nuclear programs my [Music] the period from 1994 to 1998 was one of the darkest chapters in north korean history a deadly famine ravaged the country in ways that no one could have imagined economic mismanagement by the north korean regime coupled with a series of floods and droughts destroyed 330 000 hectares of farmlands including 1.9 million tons of grain and that led to mass starvation and deaths it was estimated that between 250 000 and 3.5 million north koreans died during those years [Music] 38 year old hannah was born in north korea before she eventually defected to the south in 2000 she enjoyed a normal childhood at the beginning especially during her growing up years living together with her parents and two siblings [Music] [Music] but things took a drastic turn for the worse in 1996 all of a sudden her whole life turned upside down she was 15 years old then um [Music] hannah requested not to reveal her identity for fear of jeopardizing the safety of her two siblings while she managed to escape to the south her brother and sister were not so lucky both of them are still in north korea life is never easy in the north according to hannah even today north korea is categorized as a low-income economy its gdp per capita is only 1 300 that's a far cry from the 30 000 gdp per capita that her richer neighbor south korea currently enjoys well there are a lot of observations about the status of north korean economy and most of them are not very good wfp world food programs at you know north korea probably had a bad harvest this year that means more shoriji on their food so north korea has serious food in security and and also the north korea's north korean monies exchange rate is losing its value against u.s dollars which means the sanctions you know taking tolls and so considering all of these i think north korea would probably be more desperate about lift lifting or eating the sanctions and especially when a substantial 25 percent of the country's gdp is spent on the country's weapons development program given the bad shape of the north korean economy it's surprising to see how pyongyang is able to mobilize its financial resources towards this end how does he do it and where is the money coming from as a nation if you sacrifice certain sector of economy it won't be difficult to develop nuclear weapons right besides i think but until you know those ordinary citizens in north korea they have to sacrifice for this building of missile capabilities and currently you know in addition to these expenses they're under very severe economic sanctions from the united nations and other western countries so definitely north korean economy is pretty bad shape 35 year old ken young used to serve in the north korean army on a cold night in november 2010 he escaped from north korea by swimming across the sea border with south korea in inky icy waters that time is winter time so i have to swim but you know it's my hometown is northern part of north korea which means very cold time is november his most vivid memory of life in pyongyang was the famine of 1994 he was so hungry that he started to hallucinate while in school you know it's like if you use really hungry you can't see the many delicious food on the floor so yeah during the ritual i sometimes see i sometimes saw some delicious fruit on the whiteboard so yeah that's the hungry life extreme hunger had also reached a breaking point for some they were compelled to steal out of desperation in order to survive ken saw with his own eyes what happened to his classmate's father during the time when food was scarce one of my classmates fathers was executed because of his father [Music] accused he he sold copper copper to adrenal copper to solder copper to buy the food but the copper is not just normal copper copper it's copper like electricity line he caught the electricity electricity line and the solder but north korean government accused him to like tradition to the north korean government so that's why he was executed it was really shocked to me that's the most darkness that moment when i was a children ken joined the north korean army in the hope that his family would no longer be hungry again he was led to believe that being in the army would give him greater recognition from the government a special privilege that could offer him sufficient welfare and security benefits but he was dead wrong most of the north korean soldiers are always hungry yeah even though north korean governments always talking to the or we we are the number one is the army but north korean soldier is always hungry that is why many north korean soldiers will starvation their malnutrition until their time many people many soldiers die because of malnutrition i they have guaranteed three meals a day but the each meal is very small they have to provide us 715 grams of lice per day but in reality uh 400 grams and sometimes 300 grams because of some high ranking officials took those rice to sell them to sell them to make money and meat i could eat maybe third time per year yeah yeah that's it yeah that's why the soldiers were always hungry kim jong-un is well aware of the state of his country's economy to the extent that he can't afford to allow the country to slide deeper into turmoil since he came into power in 2011 there have been signs that he's been trying desperately to improve the situation even while the country is under the crushing economic sanctions kim jong is also keen to open up the economy he is so far only doing it through backdoor channels through trade with china so trade with china has also picked up in recent months compared to what the situation was last year when china's also actively enforcing the sanctions so for instance private market enterprises are completely banned but if you see some reports if you see some documentaries you will find evidence that yes they have been tolerated so they aren't being actively pursued they aren't being actively penalized but we try to smuggle in goods and sell them in a black market rate in certain cities you know of north korea that's slightly different so tolerating itself is the first step that yes he's not completely outright jailing them but today ensuring economic survival will not only be his sole motive having developed his nuclear arsenal he now wants to improve and expand the economy to help secure his regime survivor is not enough for north korea it might have been enough in the past not anymore so it's a matter of time in my opinion you know north korean people cannot just live with survivor you know they they need to change as well they need more they need better life so i think even the north korean leader realizes that so that's why he's very eager to talk to the united states and have these sanctions lifted kim jong-un's nuclear weapons are his insurance to keep the kim family in power but perhaps there can be other guarantees such as a transformation to a prosperous economy with true popular support instead of the shocking or tactics of military strength so if kim jong-un's ultimate goal is the survival and security guarantee of his regime what can the united states offer in terms of reassurance in return for north korea's denuclearization [Music] this barbed wire ring fences in jingak the last village on the border between north and south korea these are prayer ribbons of those who hope for peace and unification between the two careers yet eighty percent of south koreans believe that kim jong-un would never give up his nuclear weapons why would he when they are his only bargaining chip the only revered she has to bring to diplomatic talks if so how then do we live with the inevitable reality of a nuclear-armed north korean were born in post-war south korea the young couple both in their 30s have never experienced war and have only heard about the horrors of the korean war through their parents but that does not take away their dream of a unification between the two careers [Music] [Music] hopes of unification are fading fast in the minds of the younger generation of south koreans even lee and his wife jion are beginning to see that they simply find it very hard to believe that the north korean leader kim jong-un will ever give up his nuclear weapons lee feels that the weapons are just way too valuable for kim jong-un giving up the nuclear weapons program he says will be counterproductive to the regime's survival [Music] economy lee is not alone this thinking is also shared by 87 year old war veteran you jay sick he's among many south koreans who have very little trust in the north korean leader despite all the fanfare associated with the denuclearization talks with the u.s go eight out of ten south koreans or in the cities one believe kim jong un will give up nuclear weapons so they begin to realize nuclear on north korea is a lifetime threat to us from for their daily lives so they have some some sense of emergency and we need to do something to deal with this you know threats it's the only leverage in bargaining ship they have which is the reason i believe that there can't be any denuclearization the moment they give it up they won't see any leverage that they have in any talks and negotiations the stakes are so high for north korea and so they're going to dig in this is all they have it's not going to be easy to convince them to give it up [Music] it's giving up these nuclear weapons is not an option what it really is the alternative what else can be done to persuade the north korean regime to relinquish its nukes or will kim jong-un simply walk away from the talks completely and leave the prospect of denuclearization unrealised i don't see signs that north korea's or that kim jong-un is ready to give up on these negotiations they're very important for him he promised his country that he would have some sort of deal with the united states but what we're going to see him do is trying to improve his position improve his hand create a kind of pressure create an environment that will compel president trump to step in and force his team to make some concessions and he's also trying to pressure south korea right now kim jong-un he's trying to pressure south korea by threatening south korea that unless they try to intervene or unless they try to break with the united states they could suffer the consequences of a damaging relationship with north korea so we're going to see kim jong-un putting pressure on all the partners in the region to try to improve his hand at any future negotiations my hope would be that the u.s has learned that it is not a winning strategy to insist that the north korean government adopt a completely concessionary approach that they give up their nuclear weapons program they're looking for action for action as they sometimes call it a reciprocal moves things that are of substance with respect to the north korean nuclear program such as a freeze on activity at yonge beyond and maybe a complete fissile material production freeze so it would include uranium enrichment the gas centrifuge program as well as plutonium and that that would be matched by an agreement to lift sanctions that particularly those that impact the ability of south korea to engage economically with north korea they wouldn't be the ultimate settlement they wouldn't be the denuclearization that we are looking for happening in one fell swoop if that's not going to happen i don't think it will take some time but my relationship with kim jong-un is a good one time is the luxury that president trump does not have as he nears the end of his presidential term in his recent tweet trump has called on kim jong-un to act quickly to reach a deal amid the stalled negotiations will the world have to come to grips with an inevitable reality of the nuclear-armed north korea should diplomacy fail and will that make the region a more dangerous place unfortunately yes if you think of even bigger countries like indian pakistan being slightly less careful you could see some major risk of you know nuclear fallout there too technically they just have to manage the risks you can't go into north korea and take this nuclear weapons fee that's obviously not happening either you have to live with that risk because you had that risk during the cold war too [Music] north korea is a reality in korea we are under north korean nuclear monopoly and our people is virtual hostage i don't think it's a mystery about what it's like to be in range of a north korean capability but please remember that for decades and decades the united states and all of europe were in range of soviet missiles and at the height of the cold war the soviet union had over 30 000 nuclear weapons so did the united states i don't want to diminish the significance of north korean nuclear weapons but i want to remind anyone who's listening that we have been dealing with a threat posed by nuclear weapons for many decades for 75 years or so it's a situation which we should not be relaxed about accidents can happen miscalculations can happen unauthorized launches can happen deterrence can fail so this is not a situation we should accept and policy should continue to be aimed at reducing that threat the u.s and south korea have put up joint military air exercises later this month as a goodwill gesture to help save the nuclear talks and give diplomacy as well as peace a chance to succeed the decision came following strong pressure from north korea against the planned military exercises it also issued a warning to the u.s that it's running out of patience with diplomacy and washington's inflexibility over its denuclearization demands with the deadline for restarting the nuclear talks looming will both sides finally return to the negotiating table and reach a nuclear deal all of the series of missile tests by pyongyang signal the end of diplomacy leading to conflict escalation only time will tell [Music] [Music] you
