hey Lau winners its allow AI 86 with another video and I wanted to talk about something that I've been deeply interested in for a very very very very long time my interest sort of peaked in this topic when I found myself very close to this source country that we're talking about today now as you guys know there is a ton a ton of news right now about our favorite fat friend our favorite cheese addict cognacs willing North Korean dictator Kim jong-un the third successor in the long line of very dear great and amazing leaders of the jute a system that is jute a communist North Korea now the reason that my interest is piqued is that when Winston serpens at I and I were filming conquering northern China one of our goals was to get very close see how close we could get to the North Korean border from the China side and avoid to simultaneously avoid like all the places where people usually go there's a city called dun dun dun it's got a port there port of Dandong and that's where if you're a foreigner a Chinese tourist that's where you're usually gonna look into North Korea as like a tourist trap thing from the Chinese side and people find it fascinating because you can actually go in the river and like it pretty close and you get to see this like kind of Potemkin village across the river from China into North Korea we wanted to avoid that so what we did it was we skirted the border pretty much the entire time and found places you can see in the footage back here villages that were really just on the border on the China side and the fascinating thing is when you go into these areas I'm like Don dong when you go to these areas that the locals here are actually Korean people you could say North Korean people because at that time you know when that Korean ethnicity was there and then got annexed by China it would have been part of modern-day North Korea long story short there was a period where North Korea was actually richer than Communist China so we talked to some some of these people here that had fan on the North Korean side and they would send over refrigerators and money and all the stuff from North Korea into China to the Korean ethnic people super-sweet people these ladies are super nice but right now in the news everyone keeps talking about the fact that Kim jong-un is potentially brain-dead or he has serious health problems cardiac failure he's going into surgery all this kind of stuff that's not what we're here to talk about whether that's true or not it's very difficult to see if you look at the headlines it's pretty insane when you look at what mass media is doing with this story but a lot of the topics kind of evolved into this idea that okay when his line is done because it's just him his sister has been pulling the strings behind him most North Koreans will not accept a female leader they'll accept that she's a powerful female but a female figurehead leader as the head of North Korea this basically you know hermit state they will not accept that so the speculation is that either South Korea will finally do something about North Korea if there's a power vacuum with the aid of the US and then also China has a deep vested interest in having a buffer state to keep North Korea nor they use North Korea basically is not only a black market trading place but also a buffer state against the US and South Korea to make sure that the US doesn't have troops like on a Chinese border right so for them it's been a thorn in their side it's pretty much China's only real Ally is North Korea they've had the sanction North Korea as well just for under international pressure but the interesting thing is when Winston I went there we saw how porous this border actually is I mean you have people every single day crossing the river the Tumen River going into China and then back into North Korea smuggling USB drives toys clothes all this kind of Savion food alcohol cigarettes and that's why you can see if you go into North Korea a lot of Chinese fashion a lot of Chinese products DVD players all kind of stuff that normally wouldn't be up they wouldn't be allowed to have in North Korea now when I mentioned the power vacuum I was doing some research and I actually found this is fascinating I actually found this Dogon account which is like Chinese tick-tock and it says Chinese dude that like lives and works in North Korea he set up factories and does all this kind of stuff and I'm actually maybe running some of these clips behind me as I talk I thought it was fascinating because it's like modern day right now in North Korea footage stuff that usually can't find you go sign up for your you know Pyongyang tour where you get guided around to go look at statues and get scolded if you don't take proper pictures of the great leaders and stuff this is real like on-the-ground footage granted it is in Kaesong and Pyongyang which are two very wealthy cities by North Korean standards but you'll be seeing some of that run in the background which is fascinating now the fact that potentially kim jongwan might have some health problems let's run a hypothetical scenario and to make some predictions I don't think that South Korea or the US will end up having a major foothold in North Korea if there is a power vacuum and the reason I say this is that what if I already told you that China basically is controlling the economy and wealth of North Korea right now if you go back like 10 years and you look at North Korea it was absolutely unbelievably an unbridled Hermit state where people just weren't allowed to do anything there's always been a black market there where people can trade stuff kind of under the surface but right now North Korea because of Kim's that the youngest Kim Kim jong-un because of his like lack of leadership and his really I can say limited ability to control every single area of the country the black market has become the proper like real market so capitalism is not allowed in North Korea legally you're not allowed to exchange things for money unless it is state sanctioned but right now what you're seeing is in within North Korea actual daily life going on where people are starting businesses they're trading goods they're buying cars or getting driver's licenses they're purchasing apartments they're getting electronics we're talking about in a country that like has the electricity shutoff every single day a lot of people don't have access to basic needs and stuff but in certain areas is a thriving economy and Winston can you skip forward so it's just the that tick-tock footage sure sorry well okay now go back back okay okay so in the background you can see there's actual life going on so like I said if you went back ten years you would be seeing in North Korea where there's pretty much no one out a lot of starvation and there is still a lot of starvation when we are on the border up there we saw people did not have enough food I mean they were emaciated their ribs were poking out these guys would make these log kind of log transports that would go down the river and these guys were starving for sure but there's this unofficial economy that is making certain North Korean people rich and it's crazy because you would never see cell phone I mean grainy cell phone footage by a North Korean defector that smuggled it out and then sold as the BBC that's pretty much all you got back in the day now you got this Chinese guy just walking around with a camera or a cell phone camera he's just filming and uploading stuff could be a propaganda effort for sure but there's a much richer economy right now because Kim his status quo was kind of like you know what I'm gonna do it horrible atrocities I'm gonna get rid of my competition I'm gonna poison my brother I'm going to be a corrupt dictator just like my family's legacy but I'm also gonna kind of let people do whatever they want financially because if I don't there's gonna be another great famine keep in mind his father Kim jong-il starved millions of its own citizens in the 90s in the 1990s while they took some of the aid and like sold it for a profit for the government the government's been running illicit meth trade all around the world they've been exporting soldiers to do dirty militia worker militant work basically for other corrupt dictatorships like Zimbabwe but you can see here there is appliances for sale this is unheard of and this is what's been shocking me is that this status quo like let's just let people run with with personal wealth and let them do what they want has transformed the country into a semi-functioning dystopian hermit state which is crazy to me it's crazy to see this daily life stuff cars on the road and yes like I said if you go to northern provinces like homegoing province those places are in dire straights they're horrible they're really really messed up at the same time people are still trading goods now and I find that absolutely fascinating that this guy is actually uploading this stuff I'll post a link later of this this dudes I think he's got a tick-tock channel as well but gone are the days of you not being able to as a North Korean citizen be able not being able to sell your goods your produce not being able to buy a DVD player or TV or a washing machine it's crazy to me so if I tie this all back hypothetically if Kim jong-un loses power because he is too ill or he dies I'm telling you right now that the fact that all of this trade is happening this unofficial trade is happening is because of China it's because we have hundreds or thousands of people every single day smuggling goods from China into North Korea and north or sorry China has already set up Chinese citizens have already successfully set up restaurants factories and built most of the infrastructure with North Korean partners but the real power is in the cache and the cache is coming from China so it's kind of like this and South Korea has had some like joint partnerships that usually fall through that have contributed mostly to North Koreans previous economy but North Korea's economy right now is based on China it's a hundred percent based on China they do not trade other than things like tea or some mushrooms and stuff like that legally with other countries so you have China you can even see China's influence in the infrastructure right now in the roads in the buildings in the fashion not maybe not hers she kind of looks like an ex Soviet soldier but you're seeing that my prediction in the beginning is that China's already got a foothold in the North Korean economy so if there is a power vacuum it's not the speculation that South Korean troops and American troops are going to rush into North Korea to claim the land it's not like that what's going to happen is China is going to come in but not with troops not with military there's not going to be a military struggle here there's gonna be pockets lined with in the North Korean leadership and holes to be filled and those holes will open the economy even more into China's hands so you'll see more and more people investing in North Korea because it's kind of an untouched market untapped market you'll see even looser regulations on economic principles but you also see a very strategic ground for mainland China they have a huge forest labor camp very well oiled forced labor camp machine already running there the populace that is very used to top-down leadership much more so than mainland China you would have a pretty receptive populace that just saw their parents starving in the last decade or last previous few decades now able to have a better life just by doing what they they know how to do their basic skills will earn them hard currency something that they've never had in the past so you're gonna see a I don't want to say slow it would probably be pretty quick takeover of North Korea by the CCP by China and also just by laissez-faire economics that China will allow a North Korea will allow in this type of power vacuum so instead of being a thorn in China's side in the Communist Party of China side North Korea will become a vassal state that will also have the disadvantage of having the US on its border but the the border is not on its mainland China aside border now now it'll be on the DMZ which has always been heavily fortified its miles wide and it's a much less threatening border than having potentially having like US troops and intelligence with South Korea self on the mainland Chinese border so it's a dream come true for China to see a somewhat instability in North Korea but they don't want to see a complete collapse so as long as this kind of bandaid that Kim jong-un is allowed to happen this kind of free-market capitalism that he's allowed to slip slip through his fingers that is going to make the transition into a Chinese state much much easier much easier pair that with the fact that you have millions of ethnic North Korean people in China just on the other side of the border that would potentially be able to reunify with their families long-lost relatives you would have these kind of cultural ties that go even deeper than their Chinese ties when we meet these we met these North Korean people that were born in China or grew up in China on the Chinese side their first language is still Korean they speak the North Korean dialect of of Korean their identity is not so much Chinese if you talk to them and you just get to know them like right at face value they'll say they're Chinese first but the more you get to talk to them they can't speak fluent Chinese but their identity is completely Korean if you go to some of these smaller cities like Eng on the North Korean border on the Chinese side everyone is Korean ethnically everyone's speaking Korean and even the buildings look like something you see even even in South Korea it didn't emulate the Chinese style right so all of a sudden you have this pretty easy transition of a local populace millions of people on this border that would be able to thrive and work and communicate with the people within North Korea as well like I said there's already been tons of unofficial economic ties between the two countries because hundreds or thousands of people cross the river every day to exchange goods so this is kind of like a win-win situation for China and that's why I don't think that you know I mean I've seen so many soda [ __ ] like theories about how China is gonna storm in there if it's confirmed that Kim jong-un is dead and that there's a huge power vacuum they're gonna storm in there with the PLA troops and they're gonna take over everything and ransack everything no absolutely not that's not how it works look at what China does with man-made islands in the South China Sea look what they do they will you know scramble jets and put in their disturb you know Navy and and harass Taiwan and stuff like that just as they exercise to bolster national support at home but you never see them go and storm and try to take territory you see things like the bait and Rob initiative the belt and road initiative in other countries it's a slow game it's investment you do not see China going there militarily like like really harassing people at face value they will report that that's what they're doing to the people at home just so that they can feel as a Chinese nation that they're powerful internationally but what you don't see is them storming in like you would old-school style where you take over a country that's my prediction is that's absolutely not gonna happen the seeds already in place in North Korea for a Chinese takeover economically and that I think the rest will fill in like the gaps will fill in it's not like a country that has had you know you look at South Korea North Korea they're technically still a civil war but they're not countries like I've tried to come up with an example maybe like a war-torn let's say a war-torn African country that has had instability for so long that it's become the norm so we're like okay a new government took over okay there's civil war on the streets okay bombs are going off it's like Oh or somewhere in the Middle East right it's not like somewhere like Syria North Korea I'll be at poor and very dysfunctional and incredibly corrupt and cut off from the rest of the world is still a functioning society it's still a functioning people group that make it through life and survive and when you remove that whole powerful one-party elements it can easily be replaced with its neighbors and it wouldn't be that unfamiliar to them I think it would be exciting to most North Korean people to have more opportunity than they even do now so you're seeing more and more you've seen like China go in there basically and set up these huge massive winter sports complexes with cabins and stuff of course with North Korean partnership you have all these kind of huge projects and building investments in restaurants like I said this unofficial economy that they've really just taken advantage of which is not supposed to under economic sanctions but it's kind of unofficial in a way so again that the gears are in motion for this to be a thing the gears are in motion for this to become a successful endeavor for China it won't be without international pushback for sure I don't think it has any sort of the spices or flavorings of a wartime scenario I think it will be subtle fairly quick and you're gonna see if like I said hypothetically if if Kim is out of power and there is a power vacuum you will see North Korea become a Chinese state for sure and I actually think I can put my my name behind that one so my advice is don't read in this [ __ ] theory that like America is gonna storm in with its troops with South Korea and like take over their long-lost land no don't buy into the [ __ ] that the PLA is just gonna send a million troops up there and rush in and take North Korea and plant down two Chinese flag no it's a vassal state it will be a vassal state for a long time until full integration has been realized and that is my prediction on the state of North Korea in a power vacuum situation which we may or may not see who knows but even if it doesn't happen even if Kim is alive and healthy and the surgery goes well the gears are like I said are already in motion they're already happening all of that economic tie all of those economic ties and gains are already paired and coupled with mainland China so it's just a matter of time either way you're not gonna see North Korea threatened China everybody is in China's pockets and everybody in China is in North Korea's pockets at that point that is doing business on the ground in North Korea let's get to some super chats I have Dion Chapman my man it's a Chinese plot to take over the world one country at a time kidding just wanted to give you some money I appreciate it Winston has has his fingers in the background there hi hi um Brian oh by the way yeah Winston I have some absolutely amazing this is not even Chinese Koreans real North Koreans footage that some day we hope to share with you guys some day some day we couldn't show it because it would have put their lives in danger mmm but who knows if things change drastically in North Korea we may actually be able to release we debt danced and spoke to real North Koreans they gave us flowers flowers and it wasn't a stunt it was it was good it was really good fun okay next is Brian thank you very much Roy thanks again Thank You Roy Lorraine none of your business thank you good job just another Patti Wow thank you very much who's you're here to picking up the happy hour tab thank you keep doing what you do both both of you more more important context perspective and history thank you it's my pleasure our hopper see Malcolm Winston truth to power thank you thank you and that is true that the truth is powerful Angela neuron yo run home thanks for all you do keeping us informed in this region you're very welcome I'm sorry for the departure and talking about North Korea today but it's very much related to current affairs within China David Ward I keep up the awesome work thank you David random 12:08 do you see potential for internal nonviolent resistance against the Kim regime I do not and the reason I say that is because although there is eyewitness accounts of North Korean people that are very much opposed to the Kim regime it's exactly what China did it's exactly what China did you had a populace in China that was so tired of authoritarianism that they went into Tiananmen Square to literally like try to overthrow the government or protest against government and were met with a violent crackdown but at the same time it boiled up to a point where they were like you know what this is [ __ ] the rest of the world's you know moving on they saw the writing on the wall for the Soviet Union collapsing they're like why can't we have this - North Korea has been oppressed for so long from day one that there is enough economic freedom right now to make them kind of just be okay and I'm looking I'm not speaking for everyone but there's not enough dissent on the ground because there's too much economic freedom and people are actually not starving anymore so in 1989 at CMS Square you didn't have a Chinese populace for the most part that was starving you gotta educate a populace that want to change political change and democracy and freedom of speech in North Korea starvation is too recent and still occurring - where the predominant advantage that they want to have in life is to have a little bit of money so they can actually have a life so for them political change is much less important because it's not even a concept and a lot of people's heads they've never been offered outside information and they'd rather have their families not starving and they don't have to ration rice every single day anji at work thank you sorry white death 9 I've noticed many anti-ccp people who suddenly agree with the CCP narrative when it comes to the weekers will you guys try to avoid associating with these individuals when getting your message out that's interesting I'm trying to think they're talking about so anti-ccp people there's god there are people out there anti-ccp people that will tend to agree with the CCP when it comes to the weekers and I think it's because they have a sour taste in their mouth about Muslims in Islam right we don't we believe in freedom of religion for everyone so and we also know that we Gers I can't personally attest annoying anyone in like a very militant Islamic region but we know machine Jang is not one of those regions Shin Jang people I mean we sit down and we have beers with them they're chilled are really nice and actually a lot of times much easier to talk to because their culture is more in line with a Western Sensibility you know that the best food in China let's be honest is the Shin junk food it is you know absolutely yes well I mean for foreigners because they've got a lot of bread they got really hearty noodles beef and yeah another the food's bell blankets yeah it's great it's shish kebabs yeah it's kind of like Turkish food yeah and the individual nature of weekers is opposed to Han people and it's more aligned with us their adventurous stereotypes some of them are true like your song do get a lot of Thieves from Shin Jung come into the big cities I mean you can also attribute that to you know the fact that they have a really [ __ ] life in their product absolutely um those guys selling those stupid nut cakes you try to rip you off yeah they're a couple of scoundrels but at the same time she's young people are and they're also trying to live in a country that they don't consider their own exactly we actually met remember we met a weaker in San Francisco it did we'll go from ginger it was music yeah he was awesome yeah you know and we went to that ching chong restaurant yes the wigger restaurant in the Bay Area there was amazing fantastic so it was probably some of the best food ever seriously so you know there's a lot of stereotypes and unfortunately the majority of Chinese people think badly about the way is they do you speak to anyone and they'll immediately say are they're all thieves and they're also they support the oppression yeah for them they just see them as thieves and terrorists and just dismiss them right correct thank you yeah a host thank you very much Lee who is going to be the new puppet if Kim jong-un dies I'm not sure it'll probably be a military leader of sorts but again with heavy CCP control I'm sure Jan first thank you hi guys amazing analysis as always would it be that bad if China annexes North Korea when Kim dies do you know check trams are in North Korea look up trams in Pyongyang also how you both doing stay safe and stay awesome Thank You Jan um that's why I didn't really throw out a severe opinion about that because China annexing North Korea would by and large probably be better in the immediate short-term for North Korean people just because of the opportunities that will arise it also could be a more gradual transition into you know becoming a part of the rest of the world I would be much more in line to say I would be much more okay with that annexation if you were talking to me in like 2008 the problem is is that the CCP with a surveillance state has gone so far down the rabbit hole to where I can't even justify almost anything that the Chinese government does at this point not because I have a chip on my shoulder just because it's gotten that bad not only for foreigners in China but for Chinese people as well so now I'd be more apt to see North Korea kind of have this laissez-faire relationship with the rest of the world and fill in the gaps themselves but that's a pipe dream so yeah that's a tough question I mean it would be good for a lot of people in the short term yes in the long term I don't think it would be good for global stability to have a CCP controlled North Korea with all of its you know horrendous human rights records and the entire economy an entire system based around human rights atrocities and basic slavery to have that flourish under the CCP would not be a good thing so yeah the moral part of me says no I think it's bad probably but looking out for you know based on people that have had such horrible lives yeah it probably probably be a good thing and I'll look into the trams thank you but cool data appropriate punishment for CCP virus I mean the punishment is very simple it's don't trade with mainland China especially with companies that are state-owned to decouple from China doesn't have to be a military threat it doesn't have to be something that is that completely destroys the world economy it will be terrible in the beginning there will be recessions globally but to slowly move away that supply chain and put it into different countries which we already seeing is punishment enough I mean if China is going to go in masquerade as this international power but in you know and through its actions show the rest of the world that it's actually just a closed off state becoming a hermit state basically like North Korea in many ways if it's gonna close off its populace so that they can't even talk to other nations or people from other nations but allowed them to go you know invest and bring money back home to the CCP just completely in a one-sided situation where IP theft is just rampant and not punished and they're you know completely corrupting international organizations if you're looking at it from that perspective I mean you have to just decouple you have to stop relying on China for everything and you have to treat them based on their actions not on their projected image don't treat them like an international power because they're not acting like one you have to act like a responsible international power and be reprimanded when you break those rules you can't be one of the least free countries in the world that is horrific to its own citizens and then expect people to want to do business with you unfortunately that's the nature of the beast is what people do but the punishment is to stop doing business with China I mean there's plenty more countries like Taiwan and Vietnam and places that you know Vietnam doesn't have a great track record but much better than China does Mathew Stein thank you for becoming a member I appreciate it Chris Partlow kim jongwan only has a daughter this could make her the first female North Korean dictator true again what I'm seeing amongst South Korean people on the Internet and Chinese people as well is that North Korean people wouldn't tolerate maybe not maybe nominally but wouldn't tolerate a female leader Coco 4 Kosh Tim Poole is coming to California to be on Joe Rogan do you think there's a chance that you can interview him I've actually been talking to his manager and we should be appearing on a show at some point great insights good info here are a few bucks to keep you going stay safe thank you very much appreciate it my major is in North Korean studies more North Korea videos please awesome I've always enjoyed the topic they changed you don't see people talk about the change you see people talking about the past oppression Cariah oppression as well but it's a very exciting what's happening on the ground there right now it's I love I love reading about it this one's in Chinese you know what Genesis I'm just gonna translate hello I'm really happy I'm sorry not happy I'm really tired of hearing people say that the virus actually started in the US I want to tell them immediately but I'm scared that my WeChat account will be erased how do you think I should deal with this and I want to be a digital nomad what country do you recommend China now looks terrible if you're American interesting yeah I mean if you're I would just avoid if you're on WeChat first off just avoid that topic completely use a different medium to tell people that kind of stuff if you care enough about your WeChat account because you will a lot of we check accounts have been shut down for even talking about this especially if you try to go against the current narrative within China as for being a digital nomad I see a lot of people doing it in Thailand it's cheap housing is very cheap to get Internet is ok it's not blocked food is cheap I think Thailand is probably a good bet I personally would choose Taiwan just because I speak Chinese as to you as well and I would choose that one because it's also quite cheap not as cheap as Thailand but I would function more in society there because I've lived in China for 10 years but yeah those would be I'd say those two options were quite good Jan also so happy to be a patron of both of you thank you Jan and I almost put my foot in my mouth last time because I was gonna say guys guess what I'm monetized and whit's and I were celebrating because a lot of our videos seemed to be monetized but what happens is they'll be monetized for like 5 or 10 minutes and then they'll go yellow which means daemon so basically we're in a situation now where we get excited we're finally starting to make a little money on our videos YouTube relaxed their regulations talking about Cove in nineteen and stuff like that coronavirus ccp virus but then at the end of the day the videos go down i've had a situation where okay the majority of my videos have been do monitoring then i got to recently they were monetizing one got like monetized and it seemed fine and it even got like manually reviewed yeah no ties and then and then i guess it's been flagged by the rationalists and stuff and it got d monetized and confirmed to monetize so that you know in three months now i've had two videos in three months that it being monetized and then one of them got d monetized correctly we're in the same boat and endgame what i was talking about actually was thank you for the patriots out there that support us yeah i really appreciate it speaking of end games the english loyalist says what is china's end game global domination now I think China's end game is to retain CCP leadership have absolute and entire control over not only its own country but it's all its claim territories and then also to make the rest of the world tolerant of what it does so it's able to exploit resources and continue its system that it currently runs with more oppression in the future kingdoms of Orden any possibility that North Korea would really not reunite with South Korea willingly for even more freedom and future potential there is going to be too many powers that's where you would see something crazy like there's been too much misinformation and brainwashing from North Korea saying that South Korea is horrible and it's terrible and it's actually poor and people are morally corrupted and people are sleeping in tents they've learned that for so long that I think the idea of cozying up to China especially in a region where there's all these ethnic Koreans is more tantalizing to them I would say that's a more natural integration than with South Korea that is a full-blown democracy and again there's going to be too much international pressure at that point from China I think that would threaten to sanction North Korea into the absolute ground and they already have partnerships and a lot of money flowing between the two countries so it would stay a little bit I also don't think that South Korea wants an immediate Serena fication if you're talking about East Germany versus West Germany that was already such a nightmare when they they smashed the wall and the the two countries came together as one unified Germany the discrepancy between wealth and discrepancy between education and infrastructure and stuff was already bad enough in East and West Germany that discrepancy was already a nightmare to try to overcome to the point now where Eastern he's still wildly poorer than West Germany that integration was hard enough if you look at North Korea trying to integrate with South Korea you're talking about like 50 times more difficult because you have a country that the average person makes like one or two thousand dollars a year versus you know with adjusted PPP term a South Korea which is probably around like forty five fifty thousand dollars a year so that level of discrepancy would make it incredibly hard to get North Koreans in the workforce to be able to live cohesively with South Korea g13 RS hi-c know what about otto warmbier arrest and death what about it it's a tragedy you had this kid that didn't really know what's going on his tour group didn't alert him properly of what he should and shouldn't do stole a banner was arrested sentenced to death and then shipped back to America and a permanent Coleman that died Senna's to hard labor I apologize basically the same thing to be honest do you wanna know the actual story sure I know a guy's got the inside scoop on what happened to him and apparently and again this is not a hundred percent proven but this is what I was told he was sentenced to I think 15 years hard labor and then he immediately tried to commit suicide by hanging himself and so the guards found him comatose already and they've managed to basically put him on life support and then they were too embarrassed to let the world know that the guy had actually tried to commit suicide under their watch so they just kept him alive and kept stalling and kept stalling and eventually they just sent his vegetable buddy back still on life support and that's why I died but that's what I heard from someone who apparently knows we can't confirm yeah I'm just saying yes and that makes a lot of sense it does it's because it's all about face if surgeon imagine if the the news came out that they just sentenced him to 15 years hard labor and then he committed suicide under their watch yeah cuz then they're gonna be like oh look at how bad they're responsible for murdering in breath right good thank you for something about Epstein and not killing himself yeah nice little tie genesee surprised no one from Fox News CNN BBC our mainstream media interviewed yet about China you have more insight than anyone from mainstream media thank you very much they'd like to make a very nice distinction between us lowly youtubers that tend to actually uncover real stories not to say there aren't amazing journalists out there there are but yeah they don't like the fact that mainstream media is slowly succumbing to social media yes Filipino white boy it's in pool believes that there's a real threat of war with China in the South China Seas what do you guys think I don't think so that is one one of many issues I think I will differ and disagree with Tim Poole about there are a lot of people that like to get excited about this kind of stuff I think there's not enough drama in their life China's threats and this is this is the problems you see these experts that talk about news and stuff China's threats you've always been a paper tiger that's what you have to understand investments not a paper tiger you know dastardly deeds in what they do internationally to retain power and get resources that's not a paper tiger but this military stuff you've seen every single year military threats from China this is supposedly a peaceful loving nation it's always for face it proved me wrong don't prove me wrong please tanita he Shania 987 I always thought North Korea as a smaller meaner China aka mini me to dr. evil agree yeah yeah anyway what do you say North Korea is a carbon copy of what used to be Maoist China excluding the dynasty system in many ways yes I would say it emulates a rich mix of Maoist China and the Soviet Union and that's the Asian culture is very similar to Chinese culture like I'm sorry Korean culture is more similar to Chinese culture where a Soviet culture North Korea and China both borrowed architecture and oppression techniques but not so much like a Russian or or Eastern European culture Chris Sexton yes Thank You doc Steen hope just hope things will be better for North Korean people and that yeah that's the tough position you have to be in if you don't make want to make it a political international issue and you just want North Korean people to be you know better off I totally agree with that and that's something we noticed when we met North Korean people in China was that sometimes having a better life is better than you know being forced into forced labor and sold into prostitution and starve to death Zachry if Kim died is the best possible situation is reunification like West Germany and GDR PS what do you think yeah and I agree that would be the best situation but I don't think both sides could deal with it potentially right now and I don't even think South Korea politically wants that to happen I think they want it to happen very very slowly what do you know about ABC girls American born Chinese I don't know about girls but some of my closest friends here in the US are ABC is because we can actually talk about China and America a lot in common there Philip Hardwick what about South Korea power vacuum reunification I think I just answered that thank you random 12:08 won't South Koreans be outraged if China takes over North Korea absolutely 100% but I don't I don't see South Korea going to war over such a thing I mean they're already at war I do not see South Korea going to war over that Seol a braum Wow thank you very much very generous hey guys great work exposing and opening up conversations about these human rights violating scumbags of the CCP anyway thanks for sharing all the info and insight about the about this keep being awesome can't wait for more worthless whips by the way Cheers thank you very much this video today yeah there's a new Earth's whips up today maybe that's what they're referring to Christina young-ran maybe the kovat tax from the u.s. to China can be forgiveness of our debt that they own that's definitely a speculative thing that people are talking about Jan one more question what about Russia stepping in that's interesting I mean Russia does actually imports North Korean labor in their forestry sector so basically you'll have it's crazy you'll have pieces of Russia that are in the middle of Siberia can be kind of closed North Korean border but they'll make it look like North Korea they put up all the propaganda all the camps are there it resembles North Korea but it's actually in Russia and they bust these people with either blindfolds of the what's it called they close the curtains on the trains or buses and they get these North Korean laborers to go into Russia and basically work for free to cut down trees and stuff now would Russia militarily step into North Korea I think the cultures are too far apart for some meaningful integration on that level I think China is a much more realistic country for doing something like that big text subdued sup thank you Ryan Jones you too are great in an interview with Tim Poole would be awesome keep up the great work in analysis Thank You Ryan Santi thank you Bryce Byerly if China does end up in charge in North Korea behind the scenes it opens it up even more slightly do you think this will create a North Korea version of the Lost Generation I mean I think that's inevitable isn't it you would have an entire populace that grew up with absolute unbelievable authoritarian dictatorship and oppression and then marginally more freedom at least economically you would see the same type of thing happen for sure I mean when your populace has been well educated but only in the politics of North Korea and has nothing no idea what's going on in the outside world again that's kind of a parallel to China too but what's going on in the outside world then that's that's what's gonna happen crap sorry Jeremiah Johnson thank you appreciate all the hard work so you milk use this for if you silver or some Colorado kool-aid I don't know this I hope you guys say safe which generation of 9/11 is your favorite Winston's least hated so Porsche 911 my favorite is the 993 which is the last air-cooled model absolutely hands-down or the previous generation like in 1986 1987 Porsche 911 Turbo with a whale tail what's your lease sated my lease hated yeah he wants to know what's your least hated 911 Porsche nine to eight which is not an onion you know doesn't count okay out of nine eleven is quite honestly I don't like them they're just a stretched-out beetle to me but the if if I had to choose it would be an 80s one that says turbo down the side and has that big wing I guess we're pretty much the same button Thank You Ryan over the decades do you think India will become an economic powerhouse for the world over China I think it will be a key cog in the whole future system of world economy and supply chains for sure I don't think it can replace China's scope and absolute dominance in the sector Noah Andrews what is the likelihood of u.s. and South Korean becomes involved in the control of North Korea when Kim's dies in putting the country on the path to democracy again I think that North Korea will retain enough stability to allow China to become the next controller course there's going to be campaigns I always have for South Korea and the u.s. to have some sort of soft power whether its dropping pamphlets over smuggling information into North Korea about the truth of their situation there's always gonna be that but I do think China has a much bigger foothold in real world economics in North Korea right now which will lead to political hold as well Kevin Lee thank you Llewyn surface it a great job on reporting Thank You Old Gringo this is old info but when I was in the Navy we were terrified of the Soviet Union until we saw their ships and found out that the USSR was mostly faking it and that is a great topic idea that I will definitely cover I do want to cover the Chinese military I've been watching for years now a lot of you know military analysts that go through drills about certain countries if they were happened to have conflicts won't be the outcome and it's pretty easy metric to base on like based on army sizes and you know Navy fleet size their aircrafts that they're using but a lot of people don't take into account the actual nature of how the PLA work since Chinese soldiers work in China so that's something I'll definitely talk about in the future China's military power is greatly overblown William Swenson even though dr. milk doesn't do house calls for fire birds here's a counter balance for the demonetised videos thank you very much and there's one left sorry I'm just gonna find it bio poesis I had the pleasure meeting kim jongmin at a
