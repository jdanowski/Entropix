currently arrest that no one had heard from him arrest that no one had heard from him but at the time no one knew that he was but at the time no one knew that he was secretly brain dead being basically kept secretly brain dead being basically kept alive on feeding tubes before the North alive on feeding tubes before the North Korean regime returned him to America Korean regime returned him to America weird things started happening to me weird things started happening to me almost immediately after landing in almost immediately after landing in Pyongyang it seems like a relatively Pyongyang it seems like a relatively normal Airport Pyongyang Airport just normal Airport Pyongyang Airport just like any other International Airport like any other International Airport except most the people there aren't except most the people there aren't really people there just soldiers we really people there just soldiers we were the only flight arriving and we were the only flight arriving and we were the only boarders there you may were the only boarders there you may have heard North Korea has a major power have heard North Korea has a major power problem they don't have enough problem they don't have enough electricity if you just look at them electricity if you just look at them from a satellite image you can see from a satellite image you can see they're basically a dark spot on the they're basically a dark spot on the world I had purchased two $50 bottles of world I had purchased two $50 bottles of alcohol in China which I brought to alcohol in China which I brought to Pyongyang with the intention of gifting Pyongyang with the intention of gifting to the tour guides which is kind of to the tour guides which is kind of customary we collected our baggage and customary we collected our baggage and waited for the rest of the tour group to waited for the rest of the tour group to collect their baggage before passing collect their baggage before passing through immigration the last thing I through immigration the last thing I remember about that bag of alcohol was remember about that bag of alcohol was was sitting next to my luggage in front was sitting next to my luggage in front of the conveyer belt when all of a of the conveyer belt when all of a sudden everything just went pitch black sudden everything just went pitch black we've been warned that blackouts were a we've been warned that blackouts were a really common occurrence in North Korea really common occurrence in North Korea but this one even took our Chinese but this one even took our Chinese guides who were experts off-guard guides who were experts off-guard because they had never witnessed a because they had never witnessed a blackout in the International Airport blackout in the International Airport which is supposed to have special which is supposed to have special reserves of electricity the airport reserves of electricity the airport blacking out here is really unusual blacking out here is really unusual there was no emergency lighting there was no emergency lighting whatsoever the only light in the airport whatsoever the only light in the airport was coming from people's phones in their was coming from people's phones in their flashlights after five minutes the flashlights after five minutes the lights come back on and everyone lights come back on and everyone continues on normal as if nothing had continues on normal as if nothing had happened happened except I noticed that my bag of alcohol except I noticed that my bag of alcohol was missing I searched around the was missing I searched around the baggage area looking for the alcohol baggage area looking for the alcohol there's nothing I asked a bunch of the there's nothing I asked a bunch of the tourists no one has seen it no one's tourists no one has seen it no one's touched it so the Chinese guides advise touched it so the Chinese guides advise me to go to this Lost and Found office me to go to this Lost and Found office which is pretty empty there's just like which is pretty empty there's just like one person there who probably never gets one person there who probably never gets anyone and I go into the office and I anyone and I go into the office and I tell them my alcohol is missing I don't tell them my alcohol is missing I don't tell them it's stolen but it's pretty tell them it's stolen but it's pretty obvious at this point that it's been obvious at this point that it's been stolen there's really nowhere it could stolen there's really nowhere it could have gone half an hour later the have gone half an hour later the lost-and-found office calls me back and lost-and-found office calls me back and they managed to locate the bag amazingly they managed to locate the bag amazingly right except the bag is completely empty right except the bag is completely empty and the alcohol has been taken out and and the alcohol has been taken out and it's just now an empty bag the bags it's just now an empty bag the bags obviously been looted and they just hand obviously been looted and they just hand me the bag and smile as if nothing had me the bag and smile as if nothing had happened I asked what happened to the happened I asked what happened to the alcohol inside and whether it's been alcohol inside and whether it's been stolen they just shrugged saying no stolen they just shrugged saying no one's ever had anything stolen from the one's ever had anything stolen from the airport before so I guess that would airport before so I guess that would mean I'm a first or maybe they're saying mean I'm a first or maybe they're saying mine wasn't stolen it was just misplaced mine wasn't stolen it was just misplaced but either way they were trying not to but either way they were trying not to make a big deal out of it and they make a big deal out of it and they weren't being very helpful so being in weren't being very helpful so being in North Korea all I could really do was North Korea all I could really do was say well thank you for the bag smile nod say well thank you for the bag smile nod and leave we both acted like nothing had and leave we both acted like nothing had happened we went our separate ways the happened we went our separate ways the only thing I could be happy was that it only thing I could be happy was that it wasn't my suitcase so it's pretty wasn't my suitcase so it's pretty obvious that when the lights blacked out obvious that when the lights blacked out a soldier who was the only person who a soldier who was the only person who could have taken it picked up the bag could have taken it picked up the bag and just walked away it's really kind of and just walked away it's really kind of a perfect crime because there was no a perfect crime because there was no lighting and obviously CCTV wasn't lighting and obviously CCTV wasn't working because there was no electricity working because there was no electricity and no one could have seen anything and and no one could have seen anything and the soldiers can really do whatever they the soldiers can really do whatever they want passing through immigration is want passing through immigration is where I was really getting scared where I was really getting scared because immigration in North Korea is to because immigration in North Korea is to make it or break it point there's no make it or break it point there's no in-between this is where people get in-between this is where people get arrested either when entering or leaving arrested either when entering or leaving the country you might think for the the country you might think for the whole trip that everything is fine until whole trip that everything is fine until you're the last person in line at the you're the last person in line at the airport and they say you can't go airport and they say you can't go through and they just escort you away to through and they just escort you away to a room and nobody really notices you're a room and nobody really notices you're missing until everybody's already on the missing until everybody's already on the flight the baggage search is definitely flight the baggage search is definitely the worst part because this is where the worst part because this is where they found otto warmbier poster and as they found otto warmbier poster and as soon as I did that they just escorted soon as I did that they just escorted him away and he was never seen again him away and he was never seen again I was scared simply because the amount I was scared simply because the amount of camera in microphone equipment I had of camera in microphone equipment I had my bag would kind of give away the fact my bag would kind of give away the fact that I wasn't just an amateur that I wasn't just an amateur photographer or anything and I might photographer or anything and I might have been professional view Agra Fuhrer have been professional view Agra Fuhrer

of gear with me which was had a lot of gear with me which was really quite stupid because it wasn't really quite stupid because it wasn't subtle at all the soldier searching mean subtle at all the soldier searching mean definitely knew that what I was bringing definitely knew that what I was bringing was basically professional equipment in was basically professional equipment in a lot of it for a five-day trip only a lot of it for a five-day trip only during this whole search my heart was during this whole search my heart was basically pounding adrenaline was going basically pounding adrenaline was going through my body and I was just trying my through my body and I was just trying my best to appear calm collected and act best to appear calm collected and act like I wasn't feeling anything the like I wasn't feeling anything the soldier turned around to me and straight soldier turned around to me and straight up just looked at me and said why do you up just looked at me and said why do you have so much equipment are you a have so much equipment are you a journalist and obviously this was the journalist and obviously this was the question where if you answered yes to question where if you answered yes to you get escorted away and if you say no you get escorted away and if you say no maybe you'll be okay so I just told them maybe you'll be okay so I just told them no it's just some Christmas presents no it's just some Christmas presents that I had recently got and I wanted to that I had recently got and I wanted to test them out while I was here I told test them out while I was here I told them I just wanted to capture as much of them I just wanted to capture as much of North Korea as possible because this was North Korea as possible because this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and apparently I hadn't given away how apparently I hadn't given away how scared I was because he just nodded and scared I was because he just nodded and acted like it was nothing had I answered acted like it was nothing had I answered yes to his questions I would have been yes to his questions I would have been arrested on the spot for being a arrested on the spot for being a journalist under a tourist visa in North journalist under a tourist visa in North Korea and I don't think Korea and I don't think I would have been treated too kindly for I would have been treated too kindly for that at the time me and the soldier were that at the time me and the soldier were basically in two different mental states basically in two different mental states I was in complete panic and he was I was in complete panic and he was probably completely bored just searching probably completely bored just searching tourists I just found it amazing how tourists I just found it amazing how despite being in two different mental despite being in two different mental states states neither of us gave anything away taking neither of us gave anything away taking video in North Korea was surprisingly video in North Korea was surprisingly difficult and extremely stressful but difficult and extremely stressful but not really for the reasons I expect you not really for the reasons I expect you see most the problems didn't come from see most the problems didn't come from the North Koreans but from the actual the North Koreans but from the actual other tourists there you see most the other tourists there you see most the people who travel to North Korea aren't people who travel to North Korea aren't exactly the youngest I'd say most are exactly the youngest I'd say most are within their middle age towards within their middle age towards retirement age me being only 20 I was retirement age me being only 20 I was actually the second youngest person actually the second youngest person there out of the 300 or so who were there out of the 300 or so who were staying in the yanggakdo hotel at the staying in the yanggakdo hotel at the time on top of this me vlogging and time on top of this me vlogging and doing a lot of video recording caused me doing a lot of video recording caused me to stand out quite substantially and a to stand out quite substantially and a lot of them actually ended up making me lot of them actually ended up making me a bit of a meme in fact mocking me in a bit of a meme in fact mocking me in not being very nice to me because I was not being very nice to me because I was standing out so much by recording a lot standing out so much by recording a lot of the tour because I was doing of the tour because I was doing something different I stood out from something different I stood out from everybody else and because of this I everybody else and because of this I noticed people started excluding me noticed people started excluding me whenever I'd sit down to drink people whenever I'd sit down to drink people wouldn't be very welcoming whenever I'd wouldn't be very welcoming whenever I'd sit next to them on the bus or try to sit next to them on the bus or try to strike up a conversation they wouldn't strike up a conversation they wouldn't be very eager to engage with me in fact be very eager to engage with me in fact they would quickly try to end the they would quickly try to end the conversation and it was pretty clear conversation and it was pretty clear they weren't very interested in talking they weren't very interested in talking to me to me in fact sometimes as I was walking in fact sometimes as I was walking through the hotel other tourists would through the hotel other tourists would walk past me and they would mockingly walk past me and they would mockingly shout out that oh you must be so popular shout out that oh you must be so popular and that oh people are gonna love your and that oh people are gonna love your videos really they were just being videos really they were just being sarcastic and kind of not very nice of sarcastic and kind of not very nice of course I didn't told anyone at the time course I didn't told anyone at the time that I was a youtuber because if I'd that I was a youtuber because if I'd done so it would have put me under risk done so it would have put me under risk so to them I was just a nobody filming so to them I was just a nobody filming myself and kind of being a little bit myself and kind of being a little bit unusual in fact I was urged several unusual in fact I was urged several times during the tour by other tourists times during the tour by other tourists just just put the camera down just just just put the camera down just listen just stop wasting your time with listen just stop wasting your time with this you're just enjoying North Korea this you're just enjoying North Korea in fact I believe on the last day I was in fact I believe on the last day I was talking to a French guy who is maybe talking to a French guy who is maybe aged 30 to 35 and he had told me your aged 30 to 35 and he had told me your life must be very sad if you have all life must be very sad if you have all the time to go home and review this the time to go home and review this video the level of hate I got just for video the level of hate I got just for recording video really struck me recording video really struck me off-guard because this wasn't what I off-guard because this wasn't what I expected in North Korea especially not expected in North Korea especially not from tourists I expected my own problems from tourists I expected my own problems to be from the North Koreans being to be from the North Koreans being excluded called names sarcastic comments excluded called names sarcastic comments even when I walk past groups of people even when I walk past groups of people that was all the kind of stuff that I that was all the kind of stuff that I faced while being there in fact this faced while being there in fact this actually kind of reminds me a lot of actually kind of reminds me a lot of high school except the people are 50 and high school except the people are 50 and 60 years old except making jokes at the 60 years old except making jokes at the expense of a 20 year old a lot of people expense of a 20 year old a lot of people would say the high school mentality ends would say the high school mentality ends after high school but something really after high school but something really valuable I learned from this experience valuable I learned from this experience was that it can happen with anyone at was that it can happen with anyone at any age in any place in fact this was any age in any place in fact this was probably one of the most demotivating probably one of the most demotivating things during the whole time several things during the whole time several times I was kind of about ready to give times I was kind of about ready to give up about ready to stop recording myself up about ready to stop recording myself but then I decided okay I need a power but then I decided okay I need a power through this just nor the comments and through this just nor the comments and all the thoughts of everybody else and all the thoughts of everybody else and not let what middle-aged people think of not let what middle-aged people think of me stop me from doing what I know is me stop me from doing what I know is right one of the worst parts this whole right one of the worst parts this whole experience was being mockingly called experience was being mockingly called the youtuber while in fact I actually the youtuber while in fact I actually was but couldn't tell anybody because if was but couldn't tell anybody because if I did then I could be arrested every I did then I could be arrested every time a drunk middle-aged person came up time a drunk middle-aged person came up to me and told me to stop doing what I'm to me and told me to stop doing what I'm doing it frustrated me so much because I doing it frustrated me so much because I was angry at these people I just wanted was angry at these people I just wanted to say look I'm 20 years old and I've to say look I'm 20 years old and I've done more in my life than you've done in done more in my life than you've done in possibly your entire life and I just possibly your entire life and I just couldn't do it I just had to pretend couldn't do it I just had to pretend like I was an amateur like I had like I was an amateur like I had amounted to nothing and that I was just amounted to nothing and that I was just doing this for a hobby or for fun in doing this for a hobby or for fun in fact I had to play along with the fact I had to play along with the stereotype of being an amateur because stereotype of being an amateur because the more amateurish and idiotic I looked the more amateurish and idiotic I looked the less likely I would be to be held at the less likely I would be to be held at the airport for potentially being a the airport for potentially being a journalist there's a really bitter journalist there's a really bitter feeling that comes with being mocked by feeling that comes with being mocked by others and having to pretend that their others and having to pretend that their misguided judgments about yourself or misguided judgments about yourself or actually the truth an issue I consider actually the truth an issue I consider completely different from recording completely different from recording myself was the recording of other people myself was the recording of other people which also posed quite a problem I which also posed quite a problem I avoided this but honestly no matter what avoided this but honestly no matter what I could do a Western or something would I could do a Western or something would often end up in the background of my often end up in the background of my video which honestly even I didn't want video which honestly even I didn't want because it because it ruins the experience of North Korea what ruins the experience of North Korea what really irked me out about North Korea is really irked me out about North Korea is the fact that the tourists there would the fact that the tourists there would get really mad at you if they somehow get really mad at you if they somehow accidentally ended up in the background accidentally ended up in the background of your video one instance of this was of your video one instance of this was when I was in an elevator just walking when I was in an elevator just walking around with a GoPro on my head seeing around with a GoPro on my head seeing what activities the hotel had to offer what activities the hotel had to offer when in the elevator from a group of when in the elevator from a group of people a lady stopped me and asked me if people a lady stopped me and asked me if I was recording of course I told her I I was recording of course I told her I was and she told me to immediately stop was and she told me to immediately stop recording normally it isn't such a recording normally it isn't such a problem to ask someone to stop recording problem to ask someone to stop recording you and let that be that but you have to you and let that be that but you have to remember this is North Korea and the remember this is North Korea and the more you think about it the more stupid more you think about it the more stupid it kind of becomes first of all you're it kind of becomes first of all you're in North Korea you travel to the least in North Korea you travel to the least free country in the world and you have free country in the world and you have any expectation of privacy whatsoever any expectation of privacy whatsoever secondly there's a camera in the secondly there's a camera in the elevator recording video and audio at elevator recording video and audio at all times thirdly the yanggakdo hotel all times thirdly the yanggakdo hotel actually has an entire floor dedicated actually has an entire floor dedicated to monitoring guests 24 hours a day to monitoring guests 24 hours a day seven days a week seven days a week fourthly my GoPro videos were around one fourthly my GoPro videos were around one hour each and no one really cares about hour each and no one really cares about a random tourist in the background of a random tourist in the background of the video the video nobody cares about who you are or the nobody cares about who you are or the fact you're in an elevator fact you're in an elevator the ironic part about asking me not to the ironic part about asking me not to record you and to end my recording is record you and to end my recording is that now you have differentiated that now you have differentiated yourself from the hundreds of other yourself from the hundreds of other people in the video you've now stepped people in the video you've now stepped into the limelight and you've made into the limelight and you've made yourself stand out it's funny because yourself stand out it's funny because this video was honestly extremely this video was honestly extremely uninteresting and would have just sat on uninteresting and would have just sat on my harddrive for probably a few years my harddrive for probably a few years before it's deleted and the fact that before it's deleted and the fact that you asked me to stop recording you you asked me to stop recording you you're now one of the only pieces of you're now one of the only pieces of evidence I have of the complications I evidence I have of the complications I was facing from other tourists by far was facing from other tourists by far the worst experience I had with tourists the worst experience I had with tourists in North Korea was when I was just in North Korea was when I was just standing alone in a bar having a drink standing alone in a bar having a drink by myself when a large group of tourists by myself when a large group of tourists mobbed me in forced me into the corner mobbed me in forced me into the corner of the bar and took out their cell of the bar and took out their cell phones and started recording me with the phones and started recording me with the flashlights on they forced me against flashlights on they forced me against the wall and this was a demeaning high the wall and this was a demeaning high school mentality attack against me the school mentality attack against me the best thing I could do in the situation best thing I could do in the situation when mob by other people recording me when mob by other people recording me was just act like it didn't bother me was just act like it didn't bother me and then I was totally fine with it I and then I was totally fine with it I was totally in on the joke right I have was totally in on the joke right I have no issue with people recording me ever no issue with people recording me ever but the fact that you organized this but the fact that you organized this attack on me in such a patronizing way attack on me in such a patronizing way and wanted to demean me by doing it just and wanted to demean me by doing it just didn't sit right with me let's some high didn't sit right with me let's some high school level crap and I really don't school level crap and I really don't think anyone would appreciate that and think anyone would appreciate that and that certainly wasn't what I was doing that certainly wasn't what I was doing to other people before you go to North to other people before you go to North Korea you have to go through China Korea you have to go through China because the only planes from North Korea because the only planes from North Korea actually land in China before I went to actually land in China before I went to North Korea and China I had to sign this North Korea and China I had to sign this contract and everyone has to sign this contract and everyone has to sign this contract basically it says you're not a contract basically it says you're not a journalist you're not a religious journalist you're not a religious proselytize er and that any footage you proselytize er and that any footage you release more photos afterwards have to release more photos afterwards have to be pre-approved before being released be pre-approved before being released basically the problem is the North basically the problem is the North Korean government doesn't want negative Korean government doesn't want negative footage or negative pictures being footage or negative pictures being released from the country but they released from the country but they really have no power to stop people once really have no power to stop people once they're outside North Korea so the North they're outside North Korea so the North Korean government found an interesting Korean government found an interesting solution of this dilemma you see only solution of this dilemma you see only certain tour companies are allowed to certain tour companies are allowed to actually take tourists to North Korea actually take tourists to North Korea and if any journalists travel with these and if any journalists travel with these companies then that company essentially companies then that company essentially gets a ban from taking tourists abroad gets a ban from taking tourists abroad and that's happening before so in order and that's happening before so in order to stop leaks of negative photos or to stop leaks of negative photos or video the travel companies essentially video the travel companies essentially have you signed a piece of paper that have you signed a piece of paper that says you can be sued if you release says you can be sued if you release video that causes future harm to their video that causes future harm to their company so essentially if you go to film company so essentially if you go to film or take photos in North Korea the only or take photos in North Korea the only stuff that can be released it's positive stuff that can be released it's positive information about North Korea information about North Korea so North Korea solved this problem so North Korea solved this problem really cleverly by using travel really cleverly by using travel companies to censor information in a companies to censor information in a completely legal way there's actually completely legal way there's actually plenty of examples of this happening plenty of examples of this happening just take for instance this video by just take for instance this video by National Geographic of a North Korean National Geographic of a North Korean ski resort it has two million views and ski resort it has two million views and it actually makes North Korea look like it actually makes North Korea look like an amazing place to travel to they have an amazing place to travel to they have drone shots beautiful scenery drone shots beautiful scenery slow-motion footage sport it actually slow-motion footage sport it actually makes North Korea look amazing nice makes North Korea look amazing nice steep sloes we go get some speed on that steep sloes we go get some speed on that I spent where I spent where yeah that's it hold that yeah that's it hold that [Music] [Music] but because National Geographic is only but because National Geographic is only allowed to release positive video of allowed to release positive video of North Korea this is essentially North Korea this is essentially propaganda because it's one-sided you propaganda because it's one-sided you only see the positive part in never the only see the positive part in never the negative if National Geographic was to negative if National Geographic was to travel there and end up releasing travel there and end up releasing negative video or information about negative video or information about North Korea the government would ban any North Korea the government would ban any of their journalists or members of their of their journalists or members of their company from traveling to the country company from traveling to the country again and never being able to film again again and never being able to film again because of this they wouldn't be able to because of this they wouldn't be able to make videos in the future so really if make videos in the future so really if you think about it National Geographic you think about it National Geographic just like any other company has money is just like any other company has money is their number one interests and not their number one interests and not really journalistic integrity another really journalistic integrity another instance is fun for Louis youtuber who instance is fun for Louis youtuber who travel there and vlog there his vlogs travel there and vlog there his vlogs made North Korea look like a fun and made North Korea look like a fun and amazing place to travel to amazing place to travel to [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] in fact there was no criticisms or in fact there was no criticisms or warning about North Korea in that entire warning about North Korea in that entire video of his philip defranco actually video of his philip defranco actually criticized fun for lure pretty badly for criticized fun for lure pretty badly for having sugar-coated the country and not having sugar-coated the country and not offered any critical perspective of offered any critical perspective of what's going on there a problem that a what's going on there a problem that a lot of people are having though is that lot of people are having though is that by just focusing on the positive of by just focusing on the positive of North Korea on these very curated very North Korea on these very curated very controlled tours where they show you controlled tours where they show you what they want you to see effectively what they want you to see effectively becomes North Korean propaganda which is becomes North Korean propaganda which is terrible because North Korea is one of terrible because North Korea is one of the most repressive countries out there the most repressive countries out there you're purposefully presenting it in you're purposefully presenting it in this positive light which is actually this positive light which is actually bad is in my personal opinion is I think bad is in my personal opinion is I think that he didn't talk about the negative that he didn't talk about the negative stuff because he doesn't want to screw stuff because he doesn't want to screw over the guy that got him there I mean over the guy that got him there I mean we're talking about a country where we're talking about a country where people have visited they spoke out people have visited they spoke out against the country they then visited against the country they then visited again and then they get life in prison again and then they get life in prison in so did other news articles because in so did other news articles because what fun for Louis had released was what fun for Louis had released was actually propaganda because everything actually propaganda because everything was positive and there was nothing at was positive and there was nothing at all negative about the country fun for all negative about the country fun for Louis then went on to defend his vlog Louis then went on to defend his vlog saying he's not about political saying he's not about political commentary and that he just wants to commentary and that he just wants to have upbeat and happy videos about have upbeat and happy videos about everywhere he goes hey guys I'm making a everywhere he goes hey guys I'm making a video today to respond to the massive video today to respond to the massive amount of criticism have had over my amount of criticism have had over my North Korea vlogs I am NOT a North Korea vlogs I am NOT a investigative journalist I don't really investigative journalist I don't really do political commentary he briefly do political commentary he briefly touched on not only jeopardized the touched on not only jeopardized the nonprofit organization who helped him nonprofit organization who helped him get there because doing so would get there because doing so would possibly restrict their travel in the possibly restrict their travel in the future so I want to explain how I ended future so I want to explain how I ended up going on the trip now my friend Lane up going on the trip now my friend Lane posted on Facebook that he was going or posted on Facebook that he was going or wanted to go so I contacted him and wanted to go so I contacted him and found out that he was going with an found out that he was going with an organization that were running their organization that were running their third annual surf school so the guy third annual surf school so the guy organizing these trips has been visiting organizing these trips has been visiting North Korea for 17 years doing North Korea for 17 years doing humanitarian relief work he doesn't work humanitarian relief work he doesn't work for the government but he has been for the government but he has been building a relationship with the building a relationship with the government and with the people there and government and with the people there and I don't want to jeopardize any of the I don't want to jeopardize any of the work that he's done with the content work that he's done with the content I've been creating what he failed to I've been creating what he failed to mention was that he signed a contract mention was that he signed a contract just like me just like me prohibiting any negative content about prohibiting any negative content about North Korea ever being released but the North Korea ever being released but the one thing that irks me is the fact that one thing that irks me is the fact that he claims his video are not propaganda he claims his video are not propaganda propaganda is presenting only one side propaganda is presenting only one side of a story in by basis the contract he of a story in by basis the contract he signed only allowed him to release one signed only allowed him to release one side of the story so side of the story so what he did release was indeed what he did release was indeed propaganda definitely makes what fun for propaganda definitely makes what fun for Louie did despicable because he was only Louie did despicable because he was only really telling a half-truth you know really telling a half-truth you know entire time he never told us the full entire time he never told us the full story story he never even warned people or told he never even warned people or told people that maybe you shouldn't travel people that maybe you shouldn't travel to North Korea if you look at the to North Korea if you look at the statistics around 800 Americans travel statistics around 800 Americans travel to North Korea every year in this year to North Korea every year in this year three Americans have been detained and three Americans have been detained and not released so 800 divided by three is not released so 800 divided by three is about 260 so there's a 1 in 260 chance about 260 so there's a 1 in 260 chance of an American traveling to North Korea of an American traveling to North Korea in being held in a prison camp having in being held in a prison camp having their human rights taken away from them their human rights taken away from them and possibly even killed as in the case and possibly even killed as in the case of otto warmbier Louie you need to of otto warmbier Louie you need to understand that any video you make will understand that any video you make will have consequences down the line your have consequences down the line your videos Louie definitely did encourage videos Louie definitely did encourage people not just me to travel to North people not just me to travel to North Korea and you put them at unnecessary Korea and you put them at unnecessary risk by far the most dangerous thing I risk by far the most dangerous thing I did in North Korea was sneak out of the did in North Korea was sneak out of the designated area on New Year's Eve you designated area on New Year's Eve you see we've been taking you an ice see we've been taking you an ice sculpture exhibit just outside Kim sculpture exhibit just outside Kim il-sung square which is right across il-sung square which is right across from this place it's like a big library from this place it's like a big library and it looks like a big palace and it looks like a big palace alright so Kim il-sung's square is this alright so Kim il-sung's square is this place where you ever see pictures of place where you ever see pictures of North Korean military parades well North Korean military parades well that's where they're held so it's kind that's where they're held so it's kind of a sacred place to the North Koreans of a sacred place to the North Koreans because it was New Year's Eve the whole because it was New Year's Eve the whole plaza and the ice sculpture area was plaza and the ice sculpture area was especially popular so soldiers were especially popular so soldiers were actually blocking the crowds and doing actually blocking the crowds and doing crowd control only allowing people in crowd control only allowing people in and out when there was enough space for and out when there was enough space for people to move so they're soldiers people to move so they're soldiers absolutely littered everywhere and I absolutely littered everywhere and I start recording with my GoPro to my start recording with my GoPro to my surprise the North Korean guides for surprise the North Korean guides for once it told us you're allowed to roam once it told us you're allowed to roam around on our own but we were not around on our own but we were not allowed to leave the smaller ice allowed to leave the smaller ice sculpture Plaza this was basically the sculpture Plaza this was basically the only amount of freedom we'd been given only amount of freedom we'd been given since we'd been in North Korea and since we'd been in North Korea and honestly felt really amazing just that honestly felt really amazing just that do my own thing for once do my own thing for once and even this freedom had been granted and even this freedom had been granted out of necessity rather than goodwill out of necessity rather than goodwill because it was so crowded the North because it was so crowded the North Korean guides couldn't even keep tabs on Korean guides couldn't even keep tabs on us anymore so that was really their only us anymore so that was really their only choice ok the ice sculptures are great choice ok the ice sculptures are great but I see the Grand Palace off to one but I see the Grand Palace off to one side lit up beautifully at night and I side lit up beautifully at night and I want to go there only issues their want to go there only issues their soldiers littered absolutely everywhere soldiers littered absolutely everywhere and it's illegal for a westerner to walk and it's illegal for a westerner to walk around on their own without a guide with around on their own without a guide with them of course I don't look Korean but them of course I don't look Korean but I'm wearing a hat and a scarf and I can I'm wearing a hat and a scarf and I can conceal my face pretty well I think just conceal my face pretty well I think just enough to the fact that I would look enough to the fact that I would look indistinguishable from everybody else indistinguishable from everybody else everybody even the Koreans are basically everybody even the Koreans are basically trapped in this Plaza because the trapped in this Plaza because the soldiers are blocking soldiers are blocking it because it's too crowded so I come up it because it's too crowded so I come up with a plan the plan is because it's with a plan the plan is because it's dark and I have clothing covering most dark and I have clothing covering most of my face if I just walk into the of my face if I just walk into the middle of one of the Korean crowds middle of one of the Korean crowds waiting to cross the street then I can waiting to cross the street then I can probably walk out on my own without probably walk out on my own without being recognized so just in case I being recognized so just in case I talked to the GoPro and I say all right talked to the GoPro and I say all right guys I'm really not sure if I'm allowed guys I'm really not sure if I'm allowed to do this but I'm pretty sure I am even to do this but I'm pretty sure I am even though I know I'm really not that's just though I know I'm really not that's just kind of an alibi kind of an alibi I would like across the street but I'm a I would like across the street but I'm a little worried because in military I little worried because in military I don't know what the instructions with don't know what the instructions with the long time the long time this is the plaza there's so many this is the plaza there's so many soldiers here at one point I even just soldiers here at one point I even just say yellow to the camera because I'm say yellow to the camera because I'm like all right I'm just gonna go for like all right I'm just gonna go for this this is what I want [ __ ] yellow this this is what I want [ __ ] yellow even if I do get caught I can probably even if I do get caught I can probably just claim ignorance I think so I joined just claim ignorance I think so I joined the crowd my heart starts pounding the crowd my heart starts pounding eventually the soldiers let everyone eventually the soldiers let everyone cross the street I'm in the middle of cross the street I'm in the middle of the crowd I managed to get past the the crowd I managed to get past the soldiers without an issue nice well all soldiers without an issue nice well all the other tourists are locked away in the other tourists are locked away in that Plaza I'm basically walking around that Plaza I'm basically walking around Pyongyang on my own unaccompanied so I'm Pyongyang on my own unaccompanied so I'm just exploring and I notice obviously a just exploring and I notice obviously a lot of Koreans are kind of staring at me lot of Koreans are kind of staring at me because I can see him a westerner and because I can see him a westerner and they haven't seen many Westerners in they haven't seen many Westerners in life to be honest so I just try my best life to be honest so I just try my best to keep my head down and keep going so I to keep my head down and keep going so I see in the square there's lots of kids see in the square there's lots of kids playing with balls and stuff I try to playing with balls and stuff I try to get some kids to pass the ball to me get some kids to pass the ball to me with her no success they weren't really with her no success they weren't really that eager to interact with me that eager to interact with me eventually though I managed to find a eventually though I managed to find a crowd of kids and I convinced them to crowd of kids and I convinced them to toss the ball at me toss the ball at me all right they seem to enjoy that I all right they seem to enjoy that I don't think they get her interact with don't think they get her interact with many corners and as it tossed the ball many corners and as it tossed the ball at me I go to headbutt it but of course at me I go to headbutt it but of course my GoPro just comes flying off and it my GoPro just comes flying off and it smashes into the floor obviously the smashes into the floor obviously the lens breaks I'm really panicked because lens breaks I'm really panicked because I'm outside of where I'm supposed to be I'm outside of where I'm supposed to be and I think I've just broken my GoPro and I think I've just broken my GoPro the lens has come off so I just turn off the lens has come off so I just turn off the recording at this point this is the the recording at this point this is the one time in my life I wish I was one time in my life I wish I was recording but stupidly I wasn't after I recording but stupidly I wasn't after I stopped recording I'll start walking stopped recording I'll start walking back towards the ice sculpture Plaza to back towards the ice sculpture Plaza to get back inside when this kid sees me get back inside when this kid sees me and out of the hundreds of people in the and out of the hundreds of people in the plaza he's the only one who actually had plaza he's the only one who actually had the courage to approach me he comes up the courage to approach me he comes up to me and says hello and I smile I say to me and says hello and I smile I say hi back but it's pretty obvious that his hi back but it's pretty obvious that his English is really not very good at all English is really not very good at all obviously he doesn't speak much English obviously he doesn't speak much English and I have absolutely no Korean despite and I have absolutely no Korean despite this I try to talk to him because this this I try to talk to him because this is really my only chance to talk with a is really my only chance to talk with a North Korean without having it scripted North Korean without having it scripted he asked me my age and I say I'm 20 and he asked me my age and I say I'm 20 and I ask his age and he says he's 15 he I ask his age and he says he's 15 he asked me where I'm from and he doesn't asked me where I'm from and he doesn't seem to understand the word Ireland so I seem to understand the word Ireland so I just explained him from America he asked just explained him from America he asked me what I think of Pyongyang and I give me what I think of Pyongyang and I give him a neutral answer I just say oh it's him a neutral answer I just say oh it's very different and very interesting very different and very interesting which is technically true pretty quickly which is technically true pretty quickly we hit the limits of his English in the we hit the limits of his English in the run out of things he's able to talk run out of things he's able to talk about this though is probably one of the about this though is probably one of the most touching moments of my life for most touching moments of my life for whatever reason he decides to grab my whatever reason he decides to grab my hand he holds it tightly and he won't hand he holds it tightly and he won't let it go he just stands there and let it go he just stands there and stares at me it's clear he wanted to say stares at me it's clear he wanted to say something but wasn't because his English something but wasn't because his English wasn't good enough and of course I wasn't good enough and of course I wanted to ask him all kinds of questions wanted to ask him all kinds of questions about North Korea but I couldn't because about North Korea but I couldn't because my Korean wasn't really up to scratch so my Korean wasn't really up to scratch so he keeps holding my hand and of course he keeps holding my hand and of course we can't talk to each other because the we can't talk to each other because the goddamn language barrier stops us but goddamn language barrier stops us but the kid just won't let go of my hand no the kid just won't let go of my hand no matter what I do he just keeps holding matter what I do he just keeps holding on to it and this goes on for about two on to it and this goes on for about two minutes and his friends have kind of minutes and his friends have kind of gathered around and they're staring and gathered around and they're staring and stuff and eventually I managed to stuff and eventually I managed to convince him that I have to go and he of convince him that I have to go and he of course let's go I say bye he says course let's go I say bye he says goodbye and I guess we just go on our goodbye and I guess we just go on our ways from there it's so bizarre to think ways from there it's so bizarre to think I'm probably the only foreigner he's I'm probably the only foreigner he's ever seen in real life and most ever seen in real life and most definitely the only one he will ever definitely the only one he will ever talk to in his entire life in fact talk to in his entire life in fact unauthorized contact unauthorized contact with people on the streets of North with people on the streets of North Korea is actually illegal there it still Korea is actually illegal there it still stays with me stays with me I really wonder what this I really wonder what this fifteen-year-old kid wanted to ask me fifteen-year-old kid wanted to ask me but couldn't because he didn't know how but couldn't because he didn't know how to say it and even still I wonder like to say it and even still I wonder like how he is in what his future life will how he is in what his future life will be like in North Korea I can't even be like in North Korea I can't even remember his name because it was some remember his name because it was some Korean name and yeah most definitely Korean name and yeah most definitely I'll never know what actually happens to I'll never know what actually happens to him of course I feel sorry for him him of course I feel sorry for him because he'll never be able to leave because he'll never be able to leave North Korea honestly kind of sad before North Korea honestly kind of sad before I left I said he should study more I left I said he should study more English and I hope maybe I had some sort English and I hope maybe I had some sort of positive impact on his life being the of positive impact on his life being the only foreigner he's ever spoken to and I only foreigner he's ever spoken to and I hope that maybe I was able to dispel hope that maybe I was able to dispel some of the stereotypes he might have some of the stereotypes he might have had about us I really hope he'll be able had about us I really hope he'll be able to see past the propaganda about foreign to see past the propaganda about foreign countries and foreigners I hope I left countries and foreigners I hope I left the impact and I know he definitely left the impact and I know he definitely left an impact on me I continue on my way an impact on me I continue on my way back towards the edge of Kim il-sung's back towards the edge of Kim il-sung's square and eventually I reached a point square and eventually I reached a point where there soldiers and I have to cross where there soldiers and I have to cross the street again so I pull my hat down I the street again so I pull my hat down I pull my scarf up I joined the middle of pull my scarf up I joined the middle of the crowd just like I had before I just the crowd just like I had before I just wait for the right moment to pass wait for the right moment to pass eventually the soldiers signals everyone eventually the soldiers signals everyone to move into the new place and I walk to move into the new place and I walk and I walk in eventually the dude puts and I walk in eventually the dude puts his arm down and blocks a crowd right his arm down and blocks a crowd right where I'm I'm now at the very front row where I'm I'm now at the very front row of this crowd I'm in plain sight but I of this crowd I'm in plain sight but I just looked down and try to act normal just looked down and try to act normal and act like I'm not really worried and and act like I'm not really worried and not suspicious at all because the crowd not suspicious at all because the crowd had moved so far up the soldier actually had moved so far up the soldier actually tells everyone with his hands to like tells everyone with his hands to like move back and stuff and everyone starts move back and stuff and everyone starts moving back including myself I reached moving back including myself I reached the point where I'm not able to move the point where I'm not able to move back any further without pushing people back any further without pushing people over or hurting anybody and out of over or hurting anybody and out of nowhere he just comes up to me he pushes nowhere he just comes up to me he pushes me over and I fall on my ass and of me over and I fall on my ass and of course I get back up because I was just course I get back up because I was just pushed by a North Korean soldier I pushed by a North Korean soldier I pushed myself back as far as I can to pushed myself back as far as I can to the crowd with full force luckily I the crowd with full force luckily I wasn't hurt but he didn't notice I was a wasn't hurt but he didn't notice I was a foreigner because if he had I'm pretty foreigner because if he had I'm pretty sure he wouldn't have pushed me but him sure he wouldn't have pushed me but him pushing me actually got the attention of pushing me actually got the attention of another soldier on duty and the soldier another soldier on duty and the soldier was able to see that I'm a foreigner so was able to see that I'm a foreigner so he reaches into the crowd and grabs me he reaches into the crowd and grabs me by the clothes and he pulls me out at by the clothes and he pulls me out at this point I'm really worried because I this point I'm really worried because I know I've been caught he knows I'm a know I've been caught he knows I'm a foreigner and I'm really not sure what foreigner and I'm really not sure what will happen at this point but luckily he will happen at this point but luckily he just pulls me into the ice sculpture just pulls me into the ice sculpture Plaza then leaves all the Koreans Plaza then leaves all the Koreans outside because he knows that I'm not outside because he knows that I'm not supposed to be out there he doesn't say supposed to be out there he doesn't say anything and I'm let back in the plaza anything and I'm let back in the plaza and I'm able to go on my own way he and I'm able to go on my own way he obviously knew I wasn't supposed to be obviously knew I wasn't supposed to be out there because he pulled me back in out there because he pulled me back in but I count myself lucky because you but I count myself lucky because you know he could have done much worse than know he could have done much worse than that that wow what an experience I was actually wow what an experience I was actually caught outside of Plaza trying to get caught outside of Plaza trying to get and not only that but I was actually and not only that but I was actually pushed over by a North Korean soldier pushed over by a North Korean soldier now how many people can say that that's now how many people can say that that's happened to them but this experience happened to them but this experience really tells us something about North really tells us something about North Korea North Korean soldiers really Korea North Korean soldiers really aren't a force to be reckoned with and aren't a force to be reckoned with and will get aggressive really quickly and will get aggressive really quickly and without warning this explains why the without warning this explains why the crowd was pushing so hard backwards crowd was pushing so hard backwards because if they didn't then what because if they didn't then what happened to me will probably happen to happened to me will probably happen to them if you get in order from a North them if you get in order from a North Korean soldier you basically follow it Korean soldier you basically follow it or you face the consequences those 15 or you face the consequences those 15 minutes after I ended the GoPro minutes after I ended the GoPro recording are some of the most dangerous recording are some of the most dangerous and yet heart-touching moments in my and yet heart-touching moments in my life okay so one major mistake I made life okay so one major mistake I made before going to North Korea was the before going to North Korea was the night before I left from Tokyo to night before I left from Tokyo to Beijing I was hanging out with my Beijing I was hanging out with my roommate we were drinking and I was roommate we were drinking and I was testing the new camera equipment I just testing the new camera equipment I just bought I wasn't very experienced with bought I wasn't very experienced with using cameras at this point we were using cameras at this point we were walking the streets basically early in walking the streets basically early in the morning laughing about North Korea the morning laughing about North Korea making jokes and basically joking about making jokes and basically joking about how I'm gonna end up like otto warmbier how I'm gonna end up like otto warmbier or something we said bad things about or something we said bad things about Kim jong-un and whatnot and I recorded a Kim jong-un and whatnot and I recorded a bunch of it some reason I was really bunch of it some reason I was really stubborn didn't want to delete that stubborn didn't want to delete that footage so I took it with me to Beijing footage so I took it with me to Beijing a few hours before my flight to a few hours before my flight to Pyongyang I realized I had to do Pyongyang I realized I had to do something with his footage I couldn't something with his footage I couldn't take this footage to North Korea so I take this footage to North Korea so I tried to upload it to Google Drive only tried to upload it to Google Drive only to remember that Google is blocked in to remember that Google is blocked in China plus I don't have the upload speed China plus I don't have the upload speed to put it in the cloud before I leave to to put it in the cloud before I leave to cheongyang I come up with this idea cheongyang I come up with this idea which I now call a really stupid idea which I now call a really stupid idea and that was to actually encrypt the and that was to actually encrypt the video okay so it's about 12 hours before video okay so it's about 12 hours before my flight to Pyongyang and I've just my flight to Pyongyang and I've just realized I have a bit of a problem my realized I have a bit of a problem my idea was to put these vlogs up in the idea was to put these vlogs up in the cloud that way once I get back to cloud that way once I get back to Ireland I can just download them again Ireland I can just download them again but unfortunately that's not the case but unfortunately that's not the case because the Great Firewall of China because the Great Firewall of China prevents me from using sites like prevents me from using sites like Dropbox or Google Drive so basically Dropbox or Google Drive so basically that means I can't put my data on the that means I can't put my data on the cloud which means I'm gonna have to take cloud which means I'm gonna have to take these vlogs with me to North Korea so these vlogs with me to North Korea so I've done a little bit of research and I've done a little bit of research and this is the best solution I've come up this is the best solution I've come up with so basically what I'm gonna do is with so basically what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna change the name of all my I'm gonna change the name of all my vlogs I'm gonna change the extensions to vlogs I'm gonna change the extensions to dot DLL I'm gonna encrypt that and then dot DLL I'm gonna encrypt that and then I'm gonna change the extension to that I'm gonna change the extension to that to dot dl l dot Mui and I'm gonna put to dot dl l dot Mui and I'm gonna put those in the Windows registry I'm not those in the Windows registry I'm not only am I gonna format all my drives but only am I gonna format all my drives but once they're formatted I'm gonna once they're formatted I'm gonna overwrite them with data that way they overwrite them with data that way they can't be recovered can't be recovered so a little bit of a complicated so a little bit of a complicated security issue and even that's not security issue and even that's not perfect like at least I'll be the only perfect like at least I'll be the only one with the knowledge to decrypt those one with the knowledge to decrypt those videos but that's that's the issue you videos but that's that's the issue you see if they do figure out like these see if they do figure out like these files are taking up a lot of space if files are taking up a lot of space if they were to happen to search my they were to happen to search my computer and basically I'm the weakest computer and basically I'm the weakest link in this chain which means the issue link in this chain which means the issue rests with me to protect my data if the rests with me to protect my data if the one 1,000 chance happened that I was one 1,000 chance happened that I was like detained or something and they like detained or something and they start asking hard questions can i really start asking hard questions can i really trust myself not to give them the trust myself not to give them the password of logs which could potentially password of logs which could potentially incriminating incriminating not only that but if I take a X script not only that but if I take a X script with me to North Korea then I can with me to North Korea then I can actually encrypt some of the footage I actually encrypt some of the footage I have there in heighted on my PC is sort have there in heighted on my PC is sort of an extra layer of security because of an extra layer of security because sometimes people get their SD cards sometimes people get their SD cards confiscated from them and I don't want confiscated from them and I don't want that to happen to me I definitely don't that to happen to me I definitely don't want to lose all the footage that I've want to lose all the footage that I've taken but of course this requires me to taken but of course this requires me to take the encryption software with me to take the encryption software with me to North Korea which was a huge dumb North Korea which was a huge dumb mistake at this point because if it was mistake at this point because if it was somehow fun on my computer then I would somehow fun on my computer then I would probably be sent to court for espionage probably be sent to court for espionage or something stupid like that I kind of or something stupid like that I kind of counted on the computer literacy of counted on the computer literacy of North Korea to help me out in this sense North Korea to help me out in this sense because if they search my computer because if they search my computer unless it was an expert they really unless it was an expert they really wouldn't find anything less they start wouldn't find anything less they start really digging deep will find these dot really digging deep will find these dot bat folders which are like 10 gigabytes bat folders which are like 10 gigabytes large each at the time I thought the large each at the time I thought the risk was worth the reward but looking risk was worth the reward but looking back this was the dumbest thing I could back this was the dumbest thing I could possibly do and this was the one thing possibly do and this was the one thing that if I was caught doing I would have that if I was caught doing I would have been definitely thrown in a prison camp been definitely thrown in a prison camp don't take encryption software in North don't take encryption software in North Korea a lot of people who go to North Korea a lot of people who go to North Korea talk about how a lot of what you Korea talk about how a lot of what you see there is scripted or that everyone's see there is scripted or that everyone's actors or something like that actors or something like that staged and exaggerated or even that the staged and exaggerated or even that the North Korean guides will sometimes lie North Korean guides will sometimes lie to you naturally this kind of sounds to you naturally this kind of sounds like a conspiracy but realizing it's like a conspiracy but realizing it's North Korea yeah it's possible but I did North Korea yeah it's possible but I did manage to capture the North Korean manage to capture the North Korean charade basically falling apart right in charade basically falling apart right in front of me one thing the North Koreans front of me one thing the North Koreans are bad at our computers and when they are bad at our computers and when they try to use computers in front of you try to use computers in front of you even to fake their computer skills it even to fake their computer skills it really shows really shows while we're at a leather factory there while we're at a leather factory there was this room in the factory full of was this room in the factory full of computers we were told the computers computers we were told the computers were there for research purposes and the were there for research purposes and the workers were free to use the computers workers were free to use the computers whenever they want for free time or for whenever they want for free time or for research or for whatever right a closer research or for whatever right a closer look at what they were doing on the look at what they were doing on the computers though showed that everyone in computers though showed that everyone in the room was learning how to type they the room was learning how to type they were using a Korean typing software in were using a Korean typing software in other words none of the Koreans there other words none of the Koreans there knew how to type or even use a computer knew how to type or even use a computer properly and it gets worse when you look properly and it gets worse when you look at the boss in charge of the projector at the boss in charge of the projector at the front of the room what useful at the front of the room what useful thing is he doing on his computer oh thing is he doing on his computer oh he's looking at North Korean propaganda he's looking at North Korean propaganda photos on a Google image search knock photos on a Google image search knock off is this really the most useful thing off is this really the most useful thing they can do with the computers and they can do with the computers and they're showing this to us to show off they're showing this to us to show off that they know how to use computers well that they know how to use computers well it's pretty obvious this room was it's pretty obvious this room was designed as a show for tourists in other designed as a show for tourists in other words those computers were never used by words those computers were never used by the workers of the factory outside of the workers of the factory outside of tourists visiting it people viewing an tourists visiting it people viewing an animal inside a cage it really was like animal inside a cage it really was like a zoo because we were just watching them a zoo because we were just watching them and they were just trying so hard not to and they were just trying so hard not to look at us just focusing on their look at us just focusing on their screens and it was kind of eerie that screens and it was kind of eerie that really says an immense amount about really says an immense amount about North Korean computer competency because North Korean computer competency because if that's their best attempt at fooling if that's their best attempt at fooling us into thinking they can use computers us into thinking they can use computers well that's just really ridiculous and well that's just really ridiculous and this really shows North Korea doesn't this really shows North Korea doesn't have computers do they poor computer have computers do they poor computer skills had further been shown in this skills had further been shown in this massive library you see in this library massive library you see in this library there was this rocket right in the there was this rocket right in the middle of it which had launched a North middle of it which had launched a North Korean satellite into space surrounded Korean satellite into space surrounded by the rocket were thousands of by the rocket were thousands of computers on multiple stories of the computers on multiple stories of the library these computers are basically at library these computers are basically at the center of the library and the whole the center of the library and the whole design of the library was very modern design of the library was very modern and futuristic and futuristic however only absolutely tiny number of however only absolutely tiny number of these computers were actually being used these computers were actually being used and the computers are were being used and the computers are were being used were being used almost entirely by were being used almost entirely by children walking around the library I children walking around the library I noticed there was two different things noticed there was two different things the kids were doing on the computers the kids were doing on the computers they're either using that program to they're either using that program to learn to type Korean or they were learn to type Korean or they were watching cartoons they really weren't watching cartoons they really weren't putting these computers to any sort of putting these computers to any sort of good use looks like most of the kids are good use looks like most of the kids are either learning to type or they're either learning to type or they're watching videos which is pretty cool watching videos which is pretty cool like they have access to these like they have access to these Pyongyang and besides the photo I've Pyongyang and besides the photo I've shown there were more computers in a shown there were more computers in a different part of the library like different part of the library like absolutely hundreds of them and there absolutely hundreds of them and there was only like two or three people using was only like two or three people using these computers it's just somebody asked these computers it's just somebody asked the question of like where all the the question of like where all the people like this place is massive and people like this place is massive and it's like it's mostly empty and it seems it's like it's mostly empty and it seems just because it's New Years Eve just because it's New Years Eve there's really nobody here and there's really nobody here and considering like this place hits considering like this place hits thousands like it's just it's just thousands like it's just it's just completely empty one of the most bizarre completely empty one of the most bizarre things about this library in these things about this library in these computers is that kim jeong-hoon had computers is that kim jeong-hoon had visited a year or two ago and he'd visited a year or two ago and he'd actually sat down in one of these chairs actually sat down in one of these chairs and this computer and sure he sat down and this computer and sure he sat down actually had a plaque to signify that he actually had a plaque to signify that he had sat here and basically glorified it had sat here and basically glorified it with his presence and even though those with his presence and even though those computers were barely being used I'm computers were barely being used I'm pretty sure that particular computer the pretty sure that particular computer the last person who sat in it was Kim last person who sat in it was Kim jong-un because no one would dare jong-un because no one would dare disrespect him by sitting in that holy disrespect him by sitting in that holy chair I asked one of my North Korean chair I asked one of my North Korean guides how the North Korean internet guides how the North Korean internet works and she explained the specialist works and she explained the specialist basically scour the worldwide web and basically scour the worldwide web and they find anything useful or productive they find anything useful or productive and save it to North Korean computers so and save it to North Korean computers so basically anyone in North Korea with basically anyone in North Korea with internet access only has access to these internet access only has access to these North Korean servers and all that stuff North Korean servers and all that stuff has been carefully gone through and has been carefully gone through and everything including videos and movies everything including videos and movies on these North Korean servers are on these North Korean servers are essentially stolen or pirated content essentially stolen or pirated content but I guess that's not really a law in but I guess that's not really a law in North Korea is it so yeah if you guys North Korea is it so yeah if you guys were wondering about the whole thing were wondering about the whole thing about me
