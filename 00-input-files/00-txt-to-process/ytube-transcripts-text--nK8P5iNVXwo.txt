[Music] [Music] teacher american student david sneden disappeared in the summer of 2004 while hiking in the chinese province of yunnan there were no eyewitnesses and his family never found out what happened to him but 15 years later new evidence might suggest a more somber story involving north korean agents 24 year old david sneden was in china for a summer language program he had learned korean during a mormon mission in seoul where he would meet with his older brother michael before returning home for his senior year the brothers had exchanged emails recently and david wrote of his plans to explore the tiger leaping gorge in southeast china but on august 26 2004 michael phoned his mother from seoul quote david isn't here he didn't make it the family flew to union several times chinese authorities were never able to find a body despite their claims that the young man had fallen into the jinsha river a posture the us government eventually adopted too but his family never gave up they eventually learned that north korea has been accused of abducting foreign language and culture specialists to train their own people it is said that they've kidnapped thousands of south koreans hundreds of japanese and chinese and at least 25 westerners in july 2004 north korea released charles jenkins a u.s defector they had abducted in the 1960s to serve as an english teacher for the empire's heir the abductees family union in south korea theorized that the north korean leader might have been on the lookout for a new teacher they then declared to have information about a white man matching his description living in pyongyang and married with two children a japanese report claimed to have evidence of north korean involvement in david's disappearance and in 2016 the u.s house of representatives voted to reopen the investigation in 2017 david's family petitioned president donald trump to ask the supreme leader of north korea kim jong-un about their son but the matter was not discussed a year later the u.s senate passed another resolution to continue with the investigation still david's disappearance remains a mystery and he was last seen leaving a korean restaurant in shangri-la ghost ships [Music] hundreds of north korean ghost ships have washed up on japan's western coast in the last decade some boats contain the remains of the crew but north korea has never acknowledged them it's been inferred the men must have been desperate drifting away aboard outdated boats into the tempestuous sea of japan analysts are not sure how long the so-called ghost boats have been adrift but it is possible some have been wandering for years given that kim jong-il pins had been found on board and he passed away in 2011. the corpses and body parts remain unidentified and unclaimed by the north korean government they are cremated and respectfully interred in buddhist temples across japan the deceased are said to have been wearing civilian clothes although some boats are stamped as state security department and korean people's army it is possible some men could have been defectors attempting to flee the repressive homeland however refugees often flee to south korea not japan [Music] most experts believe the bodies belong to fishermen after the soviet union stopped supporting the nation almost three and a half million north koreans starved to death despite their superstitions and fears and at the risk of running into young huang the fabled dragon king they set out to the sea under kim il-sung's leadership the democratic people's republic of korea's fishing fleet became a standpoint of how modern and prosperous the socialist state was the government nationalized the fishing grounds boats factories and other fishing equipment around 1948 it is said that north korean fishermen still use the same equipment and methods since then recent investigations also suggest that illegal chinese fishing in korean waters might be pushing downtrodden fishermen towards japanese territory but as secretive as north korea is we may never know what is really happening reactivated in mid-2016 a north korean shortwave radio station was reactivated after a 16-year absence a female voice announced that she would review mathematics work and proceeded to enumerate several pages and questions south korean officials believe the messages were codes intended for north korean sleeper agents in south korea and japan for a country that consistently exalts its nuclear supremacy it's unclear why north koreans would keep using outdated methods to communicate outside their country some analysts suggest it may be a psychological warfare tactic as it is rekindling fear in the south decades ago it wasn't uncommon to receive static filled signals from north korea despite the south korean government's efforts to bar civilians from listening still the broadcast emitted on june 24th and july 15th came after a 16-year silence and it left specialists confused about the north's intentions kim dong-sik a former north korean intelligence officer captured by south korea in 1995 advised officials that the broadcast should be taken seriously he warned that the north may have been reactivating their espionage efforts and recalled having listened to similar transmissions while working for them in the first transmission an eerie female voice uttered quote from now on i will give review work for the subject of mathematics under the curriculum of a remote education university for exploration agents of the 27th bureau season proceeded quote on page 459 question number 35 on page 913 question number 55 on page 135 question number 86 it is believed the messages could have been codes intended for spies in south korea and japan it is still uncertain what these codes might have instructed them to do especially during such a tense nuclear climate invitation only in the 1970s north korean leader kim jong-il began building special invitation-only zones within the country these areas were to be populated by young japanese nationals snatched from coastal towns and thrown in sacks on inflatable rafts the program quickly expanded around the world and north korean agents are believed to have possibly abducted thousands for years there had been rumors and conspiracy theories about north korea abducting hundreds of japanese civilians but as evidence kept mounting it got harder to look away many world governments deny it but citizens from europe the middle east and other asian countries are also believed to have been kidnapped the special invitation only zones implemented by kim jong-il in the 1970s were buildings inhabited by japanese abductees mainly young people snatched from coastal towns the youngest known abductee was only 13 years old some theories claim she could have possibly witnessed north korean agents in action the older ones most of them in their 20s are said to have been kidnapped to teach the north korean intelligence about the japanese language and culture as the program expanded worldwide it just said that north korean agents could have abducted thousands and subjected them to brainwashing programs to create families of spies that could be sent back to their home countries in 2002 kim jong-il finally admitted to holding 13 japanese captives he returned though still alive along with the cremated remains of the rest the dictator apologized for the quote appalling incident caused by quote blindly motivated patriotism and misguided heroism that he would not tolerate among his citizens the world and especially japan were outraged and several non-profit organizations are still working to bring missing nationals back to their homes not picked to in september 2016 a 5.3 magnitude earthquake rocked the punggi area of north korea intelligence satellites picked up evidence of a 10 kiloton underground nuclear test explosion and experts believe north korea could have been deliberately stressing seismic fault lines in the region the suspicions only grew after a 5.4 magnitude earthquake struck south korea only three days later mount pektu a sacred volcano in north korea is responsible for one of the largest eruptions in modern history roughly a millennium afterward world officials are still worried that north korea's nuclear testing and underground facilities might set it off with catastrophic consequences the explosion that happened on par with the 5.3 magnitude earthquake took place nearly 75 miles from the volcano over 1.6 million people lived within those 62 miles the 5.4 magnitude earthquake in south korea three days later was the strongest one the nation had suffered since the 1970s even though experts claimed north korea could have been stressing seismic fault lines it is unclear whether the detonation and the seismic activities in both nations were related montpectu has been exposed to at least 10 earthquakes between 2016 and 2018. as the chinese share the volcano with north korea they have worried for years that kim jong-un's actions might cause an eruption it would probably take more than 50 kilotons to induce a volcanic eruption five times the magnitude of the 2016 explosion but each nuclear test has been consistently escalating adding to the tensions between the socialist state and the united states in an unprecedented move north korea later invited western scientists to study volcano activity after suspicious bulges were noticed but the threat still remains you
