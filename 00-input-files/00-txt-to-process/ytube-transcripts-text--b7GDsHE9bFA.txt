. THANKS, ALEX. MHM. RIGHT. OUR NEXT GAS ESCAPE FROM NORTH KOREA AT THE AGE OF 13 AND SAYS SHE ALWAYS VIEWED AMERICA AS THE COUNTRY IF FREE SPEECH WELL INTO ATTENDING COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY, SHE SAYS, THE OPPRESSIVE CULTURE AT THE UNIVERSITY AND AWOKE ANTI AMERICAN CURRICULUM FOCUSING ON POLITICAL CORRECTNESS SHOCKED HER. SHE EVEN SAYS IT'S MORE NUTS THAN ANYTHING SHE EXPERIENCED IN NORTH KOREA. JOINING US TO TELL US HER STORY IS NORTH KOREAN HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS. YUMMY PARK. THANKS SO MUCH FOR JOINING US TODAY, SO TALK TO US ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCE AT THE COLLEGE. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME AFTER ATTENDING COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY, I REALLY REALIZED EVEN IN AMERICA, THERE IS SUCH A THING CALLED A FELT CRYING. THE FIRST THING THAT MY MOM TOLD ME AS A YOUNG GIRL WHEN I WAS GROWING UP IN NORTH KOREA WAS, DON'T EVEN WHISPER BECAUSE THE PERSON MICE COULDN'T HEAR ME. AND LATER SHE TOLD ME THAT MY PONG WAS THE MOST DANGEROUS WEAPON THAT I HAD IF I SAID ANYTHING WRONG, IT COULD KILL LIKE THREE GENERATIONS OF MY FAMILY. GOING TO COLUMBIA ALSO LEARNED, UH, THE SIMILAR THING THAT THERE'S SO MUCH ANTI WESTERN SENTIMENT. I COULDN'T BELIEVE I AM I SITTING NORTH KOREAN CLASSROOM OR ACTUALLY IN THE HEART OF THE WESTERN DEMOCRACY. I DIDN'T BELIEVE THIS. MM HMM. YEAH. I WAS CURIOUS WHETHER YOU STILL HAVE RELATIVES THERE WHETHER YOU STILL TALK TO THEM WHETHER THINGS ARE GETTING BETTER OR WORSE. AS I SAID, THE SIMILARITY THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE I SPOKE OUT AGAINST THE DICTATORSHIP IN NORTH KOREA, THREE GENERATIONS OF MY FAMILY GOT PUNISHED. I DON'T KNOW IF THEY HAD EXECUTED OR SENT A POLITICAL PRISON CAMP. AND THAT COLLECTIVE GIVE WATCH SHOCKED ME THE MOST IN AMERICA PEOPLE RIGHT NOW BEING PENALIZED BEING WHITE, BECAUSE THEIR ANCESTORS SOME OF THEM OWNED THE SLAVES. PEOPLE SHOULD BE LIKE IT, YOU KNOW, WIPE REVOLUTION. THAT'S THE ONE THING THAT YOU CAN NEVER CHOOSE. YOU CANNOT YOU ANCESTORS AND SEEING THESE PEOPLE BEING PUNISHED FOR THEIR NOT THE CRIME DAY COMMITTEE. AND THAT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING UNDER KIM JONG UN'S REGIME. THE CRIMES THAT I COMMITTED, WHICH YOU'RE SPEAKING OUT THAT MY FAMILY GOT PUNISHED FOR IT. YOU HAD MENTIONED IN AN INTERVIEW. I WAS READING EARLIER THAT THEY'RE FORCING YOU TO THINK THE WAY THEY THINK. GIVE US SOME EXAMPLES OF THAT. YES IT WAS SO IRONIC THAT YOU KNOW, GOING TO AMERICAN UNIVERSITY. I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO FINALLY LEARN HOW TO THINK CRITICALLY, BUT WHICH IS EVERY CLASSROOM, THE PROFESSORS SAY. EVERYTHING THAT YOU KNOW THE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE IS BECAUSE OF WHITE MAN THEY COLONIZED. THEY DESTROYED AFRICA, ASIA, THE WORD AND HOW? WHY MANAGE CONTINUOUSLY DOING SO MUCH EVIL TO THE REST OF THE WORDS. AND EVERY EXAM PROFESSOR WAS HAVING THIS NARRATIVE TO TELL US AND, OF COURSE, IN ORDER TO FOR ME TO GRADUATE FROM COLUMBIA. I HAD TO LEARN HOW NOT TO QUESTION. AND JUST ADOPT THEIR THINKING SO I COULD GRADUATE AND EVEN I'M SURE THAT'S HOW I DID, AND THAT'S HOW I GOT GRADUATED FROM THE UNIVERSITY. YEAH. DID ANYBODY QUESTION IT? BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE SOMEBODY SOMEWHERE WOULD OBJECT, AND I'M KIND OF CURIOUS WHAT THE REPERCUSSIONS WERE FROM THAT? SO I DID. I WAS THE ONLY ONE RAISING MY HAND AND I ASKED SEVERAL TIMES I DID ATTEMPT I TOLD THEM I LOVE JANE AUSTEN. AND BECAUSE YOU KNOW, IN NORTH KOREA, THERE IS NO CONCEPT OF ROMANTIC LOVE. THE ONLY LOVE PEOPLE KNOW IS THE LOVE FOR THE DEAL LEADER. THEY DON'T EVEN LET US KNOW THAT HUMANS CAN LOVE EACH OTHER ROMANTICALLY. SO FOR ME LEARNING ABOUT HIS STORY WAS SUCH AN AMAZING THING. AND THEY TOLD ME IN YOUR BRAIN WASHED. THESE ARE BIGGEST. THESE ARE RACIST, AND THEY ARE SUBCONSCIOUSLY BRAINWASHING. YOU BUY YOUR READING JANE AUSTEN. HAS A COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY REACHED OUT TO YOU AS FAR AS SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU'RE YOU'VE SAID. NO, ACTUALLY, BUT SOME OF MY CLASSMATES ACTUALLY REACHING OUT TO ME SAYING EXACTLY FOR THE SAME WAY, BUT THEY COULDN'T TELL ME BACK THEN. ALSO, THEY TOLD ME THEY CANNOT TALK ABOUT THEIR VIEWS STILL PUBLICLY BECAUSE THERE ARE JOBS IN NEW YORK CITY. TOLD ME TO KEEP THIS PRIVATE, BUT I SUPPORT YOU, AND THAT'S WHAT THEY TOLD ME AND HE MADE ME THINK I WAS NO LONGER THERE, BUT NOBODY COULD EVER EXPRESS OUR TASK FULLY IN THAT ON THE CAMPUS. WELL, THANK YOU FOR TELLING US YOUR STORY. UH YOUNG, THE YOUNG ME IT'S ASTOUNDING THAT YOU COME FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY AND SEE THIS RIGHT HERE IN THE BASTION OF FREEDOM AND LIBERTY THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO KEEP YOU FROM THINKING FREELY. IT'S JUST SO HEARTBREAKING, RIGHT? I MEAN, THIS REALLY MAKES ME KEEP THINKING WHAT IT MEANS TO BE HUMAN BEING IN NORTH KOREA. WE ARE BRAINWASHED BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE INTERNET IN THIS 21ST CENTURY. WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE REST OF THE WORLD. WHAT SHOCKED ME. AMERICA RIGHT NOW IS THAT THEY HAVE SO MUCH KNOWLEDGE. THEY KNOW WHAT COMMUNIST INDEED THAT THEY KNOW WHAT AUTHORITARIAN DOES. AND IF EVEN WITHIN FULL OF KNOWLEDGE, THEY STILL TREATING THIS PATH OF MADNESS. AND THIS IS WHAT I'M LIKE. SO AFRAID OF, WHY ARE THESE PEOPLE COLLECTIVELY GOING CRAZY BEYON
