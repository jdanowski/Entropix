I didn't see it as pressure I saw it as a marvelous opportunity to do something very very few people have done before my name is Amy fuller I am a two-time Winter Olympian professional snowboarder and documentary marathon expedition ur sport has massively shaped the direction of my life I love movement movement to me is medicine so if I'm not snowboarding I'm out and about trying to find the next best thing how my first ever marathon came about someone on my social saw that I was training for London's then they approached me when I was asked if I wanted to run another marathon my response was no she said it was in North Korea and at that point I said tell me more six weeks later I was hopping on a one-star airline flight to North Korea leaving all of my electronic devices valuable personable items in a safe I think the most terrifying thing was knowing that I would have no communication with the outside world and if something did go wrong I had no way of contacting back home at the airport in Pyongyang as we pulled in I looked around and there are a couple of planes and you know your mind starts like playing tricks on you like the planes you know you've seen the documentary they're not real planes they're just on the tarmac because they want to make it look like there's loads of planes here when we'd embark on the drive I look to my right and there's people walking I look to my left more people walking there's bikes and they're walking miles and miles I was like why are people walking our guide says they're walking because we want to keep our city clean we don't want any pollution the only cars on the road a diplomatic cars so straightaway it was an eye-opener it was evident from the moment we stepped foot in the country the power the Olympics has sport is the bolt hold identity for North Korea when we met the North Korean athletes sport was the common language it was the only way in which we could relate but the marathon really brought the home how globally that event can open up North Korea marathon day to imagine an Olympic Stadium where there has never been an Olympics 50,000 North Koreans all dressed in a very similar fashion it was like a sea of black clapping in an orderly syncs [Music] to start with there's thousands lining the street everyone in the city was there to support however they rule in the stadium which meant as soon as we got a few miles out of the stadium it was desolate it was like barren farmland firm miles I love to explore and in North Korea there was no exploring you will see this you will look at this and you will be here at this time we were on their schedule but the marathon there were elements of pain and there were dark moments but that sport you know to get through anything and to be at the top you have to go through their whirlwind of emotions and I learned that I can power through
