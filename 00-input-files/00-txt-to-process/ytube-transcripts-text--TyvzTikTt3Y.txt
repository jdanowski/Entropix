this train goes all the way to Pyongyang in North Korea on North Korea the breaking news hello everyone and welcome back to Beijing China my I'm at the train station right now and I'm just about to get on a train from here to the border of North Korea because I've been keeping it a little bit of a secret but I'm about to spend a few days in North Korea seeing it for myself this train actually goes all the way through to Pyongyang well I'm gonna do instead is jump off at the border town which is called Dandong have a little look around there and then get back on this train in a couple days it's I actually need to go that's leaving in about 20 minutes it's an overnight hit rahein and I'm going to show you [Applause] I put the takeout on line by the way it's very easy how much we put two yesterday still availability and I think I've got a middle but sleeper there is also a high speed one but I'm getting the slower longer one just because it was cheaper let's go check it out mrs. Smith I'm just about to get on this carriage now I'm probably gonna stop filming it's like the end I don't want whoever I'm sat next to to immediately see this camera this [Music] this is effectively gonna be me for the next 14 hours [Music] just had to exchange my ticket for this ticket for some reason look at that hair I'm gonna have a quick look around see if there's any snacks I very naively didn't bring any with me so hopefully it was a snack car oh okay yeah I think I get it when they do this not catotti going past anyways well that's 30 as far as I can mr. [Music] actually doesn't look at let's be honest this slim pickins I see with this nothing looks whatever [Music] okay let's talk outside time to sleep now see you guys the morning okay that was a fairly quick 14 hours actually slept for like ten of it welcome to Dan down I need to figure out how to get to my hostel [Music] let me tell you it is not warm it's quite a bit further north than Beijing and it was cold already in Beijing in April I've only got my shorts on because I came from Bartlett just with hand luggage yeah anyway I'm here in Dandong for two days and then I'm gonna be getting back on that train in two days time to head to Pyongyang [Music] here we are that was unexpected yeah it looks like it's just a wedding I have something else to tell you so I'm on an island right now called moon island and it's actually where I'm staying I just came out the hostel it turns out that this river is the border with North Korea so that right there just that far away is North Korea I actually just looked at Google Maps when I was in my room and according to that I was already in North Korea over the border cuz I think like the line is straight along the river so obviously I'm not quite yet this is still China and I'm gonna go through the immigration in a couple days time but for now I'm gonna try and show you a little bit of this border town of Dandong [Music] [Music] walking around so far doesn't feel like there's a great deal going on whatever goes down I'm also trying to get cash out and so far from three ATMs no luck so unis in pay and not Visa or MasterCard so far okay eventually got money out the main reason is is because most ATMs here use Union pay which I don't have a card for I've just got Visa and MasterCard I did eventually find one that uses visa anyway so the reason I just got money out now is because when you're in North Korea I've been told you're not allowed to handle the North Korean currency as a foreigner you have to use a foreign currency so I've just got a Chinese R and B out because I can use that there but also as well I was told it's better to have smaller denominations so when you get cash out it comes in a hundred which is basically about fifteen dollars and now we need to break them before I go in so I have mostly smaller notes to use [Music] okay I'm in the hostel now and I'm actually gonna cut this video short I am leaving for North Korea tomorrow morning I think we get in the train about 8 a.m. and I've just I haven't actually been doing as much exploring here in Dandong as I planned to I've actually just been getting ready to spend the next few days in North Korea because there's no internet whatsoever there for foreigners as far as far as I know so I won't be able to get any internet so I'm catching up with things beforehand I want to say that if you're gonna watch these next videos of me being in North Korea then I'm going into it with our expectations and with an open mind and I'm basically just gonna show what I see there and document it and then show you guys after so if you do want to see that if you want to see what it's like in North Korea in April 2000 19 which is what I'm going then make sure to watch the next videos that's what I'm gonna say right now so check back for the next few and you can see and yeah that's it tomorrow morning we're going I think I'll cut forward slightly to then so see in the morning okay I'm gonna finish the video here I'm just about to get on the train I have my North Korean tourist card and it's like you said follow the next few videos if you're interested but for now thank you for watching and this is my life [Music]
