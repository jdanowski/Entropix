[Music] [Music] [Music] alright guys good morning last night great shape I lost my voice we had some goodbye drinks in the bar and there was it like 2:00 a.m. I think yeah I was a good night just woke up we have one hour to prepare and we need to go to the airport to fly back to Beijing with Korea tourists overall was a crazy impressive interesting trip time to finish packing I get my last breakfast and feel a bit better hopefully so yeah thank you for watching and see you in a bit [Music] [Laughter] [Music] when I was sitting in front of the bus on my way to the airport I realized it was the last morning in North Korea time passed by really fast and due to a full program there was not much time to process or realize what we really have seen or not have seen one thing I was sure about is that only birds can move freely in and out of North Korea who knows what the birds in South Korea have seen when they crossed the DMZ from the north we can only envy their freedom I guess it's true what all people say you enter North Korea with a few questions but you live with a thousand that makes our files fuller than the pyongyang roads in the morning it was a fascinating experience that I will never forget I was the past videos I hope that I can give people a glimpse of what I have seen on the tour and now we almost arrived to what it seems a brand new airport ready to accommodate all the tourists it's reminded me of the Dodos own train station ready to departure from South Korea to North Korea it was an ironic sight knowing that only one flight will departure from Beijing today [Music] before going through immigration I had to fill in what items I brought into North Korea such as my camera and power banking after that it was time to say goodbye to my visa [Music] after immigration it was time to mentally prepare for the one and only one star airline Air Koryo they have been granted this award until 2018 and my experience it was of course not great but at least I had enough leg space unlike many other airlines space is holy to be an apparently older planes equals more leg space when I was born I didn't know I wasn't allowed to film in the airplane so like anywhere else on this trip I was filming until one of the hostesses told me to delete the footage the only thing I got is this newspaper with remarkable social histories the rest of the flight I was sleeping until the moment Air Koryo arrived in Beijing there we could see Korean Airlines preparing for departure there was quite an iconic sight and for some reason it felt a little weird so Beijing Airport it was also time to say goodbye to my father and to continue my journey to South Korea [Music] look who we have here do you remember her from episode one luckily curry I will say goodbye to me at the airport well I wanted to give myself ten seconds to be sure of it what did you not I was like waving to some strange woman that was just so next the last thing that I want to add to the series is a Q&A so I already received a lot of interesting and nice questions in the comments underneath the video and also in the community tab if you have more questions then please let me know below this video and I will consider answering them and make sure they are interesting because I received so many of the same questions there are a road a few down that I will answer now so one question I receive a lot of times from Koreans is that can South Koreans go to North Korea well that's simple answer no you cannot unfortunately it's a superset and I really hope that soon or one day you can go there by yourself how much is the tour well the tour itself like the package itself is only 1500 euros that includes the food accommodation the train ride into North Korea and the flight out of North Korea but you have to add to that the flight to China the visa for China you have to give tips to the tour guides well you don't have to but it's expected which is quite a lot of money and of course you want to buy souvenirs if you're in a country like that so in total I think I spent almost 2500 euros so am I allowed to film in North Korea and the answer is yes I was surprised about how much I could film basically everything I've seen I could film except for the military and construction sites and this question come on guys Bart why did you go to the barber shop really you know I might be both and I might be by Chuck when Chuck but you know there's still some hairs growing and I need to take care of it I need to shave it I need to wash my hat yeah I take care of my beard so now and then not actually I never go to the barbershop but in North Korea I wanted to make an exception then money power yeah last thing I want to say is that you know you must know that I'm really happy to be back in South Korea finishing the last vlog felt like finishing a chapter in my life my channel has grown like enormous Lee that was crazy I never expected this to happen like and what was it like five six days I grew from 1500 subscribers to 25,000 subscribers so many people have seen my videos and I received so many positive and touching comments I quickly get back to making videos in South Korea I'm super looking forward to that if you have any suggestions like if you if there's something you want to see from me after the North Korea series then please let me know in the comments I read everything even though I cannot reply to everything but trust me I read everything I hope you really enjoy watching and I hope you can keep following me even after the North Korea series is over because that's what I really worried about I really hope you guys can respect my future videos as well and I really try my best to create something nice create something beautiful and this time it will be focused more on South Korea itself and maybe I can make some links with North Korea later I'm working hard on creating new ideas for the future so thank you for watching this
