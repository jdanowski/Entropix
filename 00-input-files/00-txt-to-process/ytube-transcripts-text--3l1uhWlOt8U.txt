Oh I [Music] for best break1 [Music] Oh we're line up for you [Music] [Music] rather one thing [Music] coffee [Music] [Music] my knife or camera to reload vibrant [Applause] [Music] [Music] like five and we're not one like a negative context of rahuri no track magic [Applause] we know better one 5,000 second last will don't want dad you alright guys so here's the tag view for that fight that just went down we got the four mig-29 is the to make 21s looks like the two I make 29 and make 21 break off and then the other to make 29 is break off the flight leads continue to come at me alright those guys are gonna break all right now if you remember I was using tws mode so I had four of them locked up in that way I thought I could give my am ramps the best probability of kill and also I waited until very close range to fire them right you got I think it was yeah right around here about 17 kilometers 20 kilometers and I fire off the am Rams right so these guys come there's the two flight leads they fire off there are 27 that makes 29 fighters that and there's everyone else behind them so I see the streak for the are 27 so at this point I make the decision that I'm gonna fire the the am Rams so I go one two three four am Rams I think and then break to dodge that are 27 didn't need any flares alright so here we go we got two more our 27s coming in that's that mig-29 flight lead here he's gonna take an AMRAP I'm on 3.5 he's out we're gonna switch to another mig-29 here and we go I make 21 at 3.3 Mach what was this guy it's 2.6 walk and that's a waste of amram okay let's come back for a second let's look at me because it was a lot going on there so those are the four am Rams fired off these are the incoming missiles the are 27s I'm flaring and cranking there we go dodge that one this guy gets an AM rim that was that mig-21 slight lead he gets the Amram at Mach 3.3 he takes it alright so that was what four mates taking care of pretty quickly this one I fired at one of the planes that was already dead but I didn't know that I mean I did but I just I don't know I couldn't tell so I fired that one anyway that was a waste of a man room here we get off a sidewinder at this guy here got an r60 coming in flares breaking to the right dodge that one it goes for the flares that Sidewinder hits him and he's done for and we enter a dogfight with this last guy here alright nothing too crazy in terms of like tactics to talk about with this little duck fight here it was just kind of a looping fight just to see who would get on six my turns were definitely tighter lower-energy he 0.6 there were a couple of situations where I spelled the plane out here but wasn't too bad doing guns and I think here we enter a downward spiral sort of so yeah he goes down I turn so we're in sort of a spiral downward spiral but I managed to get on his six and this just becomes a gun show until that makes dead pretty resilient make though like I can kind of hit him a couple times and he was still flying where's that first hit second hit and then this is where he dies all right guys so that's the TAC view for the fight I hope you enjoyed the video I'll see you next time
