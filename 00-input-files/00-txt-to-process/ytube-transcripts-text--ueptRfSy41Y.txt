we show you a north korea you've never seen [Music] as we head inside the world's most secretive state at a time of unprecedented tension who is the enemy american yankees to visit a place like that it was almost a bit of a a you know oh we'll just have it go and ask if we can come in one day assuming that they'd say no and i literally heard nothing for nearly two years and got an email out of the blue from this organisation that claimed to run to us there saying oh yeah we've finally found your application to come to north korea yep you can come in for a week to pyongyang and i honestly thought it was a stitch up an ever-present team of minders carefully monitors our every move on a highly orchestrated tour led by government official ju jong hyok the problem is that most of the western people have no idea what is going down here they don't know the reality of our country north korea wanted us to see only what they wanted us to see you know there was no chance for us to walk the streets if we turn up in most cities in the world we can go for a walk and if we want to shoot something down the road we go and shoot it if we want to go and talk to someone on a corner no problem in north korea you basically got put on a bus they drive you to a location so get out you've got 15 minutes to film here get back on the bus and then you're not allowed to film not allowed to film drive you to a new location okay you can film this get back on we weren't under any illusions that this wasn't some sort of propaganda tour we're on our way 200 kilometers east to the city of won sun a bumpy five-hour journey through dirt pool farmland and dark tunnels [Music] we stop briefly at a coffee shop where the walls are plastered with pictures of north korean missile launchers they were trying to show north korea as a as very much a progressive and happy country and for us it was trying to where we could pick through the cracks and actually see behind the facade of what really goes on in north korea no matter how old or young everyone here marches to the beat of the regime to see something is better than seeing nothing and you know we can interpret what we see and try and explain to our viewers uh you know the different layer of the land uh over there north korea is genuinely still one of those frontier locations that people really have no idea what goes on behind the curtain what are you teaching these boys do you teach them the technique i teach guerilla warfare the tactics kimi-sung used to vanquish the japanese army what's striking is that the children also see these games as practice for war what do you like about this game i'm so happy to kill americans so you dream this is an american that you're shooting americans and japanese and south koreans they are the enemy of the korean people when we went in there it was at the height of the nuclear missile standoff between north korea and america and you know tensions were high before we'd even set foot there from my perspective the thing that scares a lot of people is the fact that you are now armed with nuclear weapons i think that not at all no threat at all but there is one threat uh it is one street in the world it is from not deeper korea but from donald trump so i think that we must get rid of this threat we must get rid of donald trump i see i think there was there was more tense moments there and i've got fingers on my hands one son is one of the regime's key missile test sites almost 40 have been fired from this area as north korea or the dprk develops its capability to strike targets around the world they are still at war no no peace treaty has ever been declared between north korea and and the western powers on the other side so they basically stand there and they have done for decades facing each other off every day it's tense that you can see them armed on both sides of the border you can see the rockets piled up this is effectively where the battle line is drawn just about the most tense place on earth right now at the moment the mood here it's deadly serious in north korea you have no mobile phone service they don't let you bring in you know a phone on global roaming or whatever anything like that weirdly once you get to the to the border with south korea you actually get a little bit of bleed over of their um of their mobile phone network so it was the one time in the week that we're in north korea that we could actually hold up our phone and just send a message to a loved one saying look we are okay uh we're getting back on the bus love you bye and so like it is amid the tension there was that one slight moment of relief [Music] there are some lighter moments on our trip to north korea another side of life here that the regime is keen to promote do you think i can win yeah of course i've been in the piano [Music] today i've been invited to take part in the pyongyang marathon yeah it's um it was kind of about as close as we got to any kind of freedom while we were there i mean we had minders on our shoulder 24 7 if you were at a restaurant if you were in a shop if you were in your hotel if you were filming everywhere you went you had a minder on your shoulder free out here for once hello high five i got a chance to finally get away from the reminders on our last day there i asked them if i could actually go for a run myself in pyongyang i was 99 certain they'd say no and they sort of looked at each other two of the minders and said okay and so i went for a run through the streets of pyongyang and think of those clowns that are at um you know carnivals and stuff that go that was the faces of the locals that there was just some random white westerner running the streets with no minder next to him it was almost like they wanted to call a police hotline and say uh there's a westerner on the loose here and i don't know what he's doing but it was this bizarre freedom i could run the streets of pyongyang without a mind but clearly that is so unusual because everyone there was just dumbstruck by this lanky white man running through the streets [Music] kim jong-un hasn't called me yet with his review of the story which has been disappointing we haven't heard at all from the the north korean government except for one note to say that um you know let's discuss again if you want to come in in future years i think i've had enough of north korea for a little while now but who knows where that might lead in in three or four years time hello i'm tom steinfert thanks for watching 60 minutes australia subscribe to
