hey tried cc7 subscriber Jack H commented on a recent video of mine suggesting that I'd take a look at the North Korea squad of the 2007 World Cup and where those players are now now he may well have been joking with that suggestion but quite frankly I've become desensitized to what is and isn't a joke in the youtube comment section these days North Korea as we typically referred to it all the Democratic People's Republic of Korea give its official title is the most secretive nation on earth what happens in North Korea the daily routines of people's lives and the political machinations that go on shrouded in mystery and football in North Korea is no exception the PRK FA who are the governing body of football in North Korea provide virtually no access or information when it comes to football in the country journalists have been repeatedly turned away or just ignored when trying to cover either the nation's national football team or domestic league and even FIFA find it notoriously difficult to contact them the PRK FA previously operates with just a single fax machine and now provide world football's governing body with just a single email address with the emails reportedly going unanswered 9 times out of 10 for decades virtually nothing was known at the league system all football clubs in North Korea football is known to be the most populous ball in the country and in the early 1990s a South Korean newspaper reported that there were three nationwide leagues in North Korea which operated with the promotion and relegation system this is still believed with the case and we do now know the 12 current DPR Korea Premier Football League sites and the divisions champions going back to 1985 when North Korea first started sending teams to compete in AFC international competitions since 1985 April 25 have dominated the North Korean game but we don't know who won all the league titles between 1960 and 1985 I point all this out primarily just to emphasize the secrecy of the North Korean state and how that extends to football although hopefully it is also somewhat interesting so whilst in a typical where I than out video I can look up say Daniel Agger and find out that he's now qualified to two artists who Cowen's a sewage company it is not quite so simple to find out where the pac-man Cheol has become a dentist or if cotrim Cheol now runs at ice cream parlor on the outskirts of Chongqing that's why this isn't formatted like my usual where I've in our videos but is instead framed as a general what happened question the resurgent players I should add specifically those of jeweled Japanese and North Korean citizenship who made North Korea's 2010 World Cup squad but did not and still do not reside in North Korea naturally researching the fate of those players in the decades since the finals in South Africa is a little more clear-cut the 2010 World Cup was and remains only the second World Cup that North Korea have qualified for their only previous appearance at the biggest event in world sport came in England in 1966 where they caused one of footballs all-time great upsets the British had initially suggested refusing the North Koreans entry into the United Kingdom as they didn't recognize the nation but eventually had their arms twisted by FIFA the worth is that the British public would be hostile and even aggressive towards the Koreans because of the Korean War but in the end the opposite was the case the nation as a whole and particularly those in the Northeast where North Korea beats Italy took the North Koreans to their hearts North Korea was led by the founder of the DPRK Kim il-sung at the time who remains North Korea's eternal president despite having died in 1994 following their thrilling victory against Italy North Korea raced into a stunning three nil lead against Portugal's in the World Cup quarter-finals you savior proceeded to score four goals as Portugal fall back to win 5-3 but there was no doubt as to who had been a tournament surprise package immediately after the tournament stories began to circulate that the entire North Korean squad had been imprisoned upon their return to North Korea due to fraternizing and partying with locals following their win against Italy the North Korean players since filmed in a 2002 documentary shown on BBC four strongly denies such suggestions and claim they were given a hero's welcome upon my return to Pyongyang by the time North Korea had it to their second World Cup the world had become a much smaller place the invention of the internet and the rise in new media has made most of us much more connected than we were 50 years ago yet North Korea remains as alien as ever there was similar intrigue surrounding North Koreans when they finished above Saudi Arabia the UAE and Iran to qualify for the 2010 World Cup but they did manage to light up the finals in South Africa in the same fashion north korea's opening game against the mites of the five-time world champions Brazil was a brave and eye catching performance as they found the back of the net and only lost the game 2-1 the promise of that display commenced officials in North Korea to make their next group game against Portugal which was a repeat of the 1966 World Cup quarter-final the first football match to be broadcast live and in full two homes around North Korea it would prove to be an unfortunate choice as North Korea with thrush seven nil by Cristiano Ronaldo and discards again all kinds of claims were made in the media about the fate of North Korea's unsuccessful players the most reputable cited reports they've subjected to a four to six hour barrage of abuse in front of 400 onlookers with the players invited to abuse their own manager the most extreme claim North Korea doctored footage to try and trick citizens into believing they had won the World Cup and that much worse punishments have been dished out to their players in 2010 just as in 1966 the evidence for such claims tended to be flimsy at best that is not to say that it would be out of character for North Korea's dare all Supreme Leader's to dish out Roe comeon punishments the regime is unquestionably an incredibly brutal and cruel one but the state secrecy can give a license to journalists to let their imaginations run water since it is so difficult to either prove or disprove anything in North Korea you could claim the entire squad have statues built of them and were rewarded their own palaces in the countryside or that they were fired directly into the Sun in one of the Supreme Leader's miss us and since sorting the fact from the fiction is so difficult in the secretive state no one would know which accounts to bully AB North Korea's 23-man squad for the 2010 World Cup there are a few players whose current situations we do know for sure the 2010 World Cup was the first World Cup in which every single squad had at least one player based in Europe and North Korea were the only nation with just one that man was Hong yeongjo who's playing for Rostov in Russia at the time and he was North Korea's captain for the files now aged 37 the veteran sense board returned to North Korea in 2011 and he has supposedly been scouring for elliptically for 25 April for the last nine years Japanese born and Japanese based here and Yong hak and Jong tey say both still live in Japan with Jonte say having been the star the North Korean side nicknamed the people's Rooney and many of you will recall his tears during the national anthem the full North Korea's opening game against Brazil he went on to spend three years in Germany and two years in South Korea before returning to Japan with his current club Shimizu s-pulse in 2015 and Yong hak meanwhile also a brief stint in South Korea but is now back in Japan post-retirement and managers FC Korea who promote Japanese born Koreans to play football in Japan and compete in the nation's fifth attack you may also recall the nifty North Koreans tried to get one over FIFA when naming that 23-month 2010 World Cup squad three goalkeepers seemed unnecessary as far as they were concerned so they sneekly decided to lay striker kim yong-hwan as a goalkeeper in order to bolster their attacking options that plan backfired and feaf responded by stating that kim wouldn't be allowed to play in any other position than england and the north korea couldn't a man mascot apparently then our 36 year old can actually playing gold according to some reports but he plays mostly as a striker now in the autumn of his career at FC Orlan Betar in mongolia although North Korea had the youngest squad at the 2010 World Cup with an average age of just 24 at least seven of their 23 man squad are boletos since retire from football one of them is former midfielder Kim Jong Hyun age 36 who briefly managed the North Korean national team and now serves as the team's assistant manager goalkeeper Rehm Yong Guk now aged 33 is still North Korea's number one and he is now their most capped footballer of all time with 118 international caps to his name he plays for Pyongyang City as does fellow 2010 squad member reach Hong myung-bo 3 Yong Guk's uncle Andy's dad also played his goalkeepers for the North Korean national team in total 12 of North Korea's 23-man squad for the 2010 World Cup as still believed to be playing football in North Korea two are playing overseas one is managing overseas one is the North Korean national team's assistant manager five have retired from football and are known to be working in coaching or management and the fate of two players is in them outside of North Korea at least North Korea have failed to qualify for the last two World Cups dropping down to 100 and 16th place in defeat sandwich between Kosovo and Namibia very little changed in terms of what is known about North Korea in the 44 years between the 1966 World Cup and the 2010 World Cup and the same is true of the ten years since the finals in South Africa the country remains shut off to most of the world with only a tiny number of tourists visiting and being led on strictly shelter trips around Pyongyang with a tour guide never far away the bowels of the nation are only rarely seen by North Korean citizens and our knowledge of the nation is based largely on the memories of North Korean defectors who have often escapes from treacherous prison or labor camps I know today's video is a bit of an unusual one in many respects but I normalize hope that you enjoyed it and I'll try to provide a daily fix for your footballing appetites as we look likely to go into a number of weeks with very little fall on our screens thank you all for watching I hope you're all
