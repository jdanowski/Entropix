[Music] north north korea ah here we go so this is china right here right across the river is north korea and it is absolutely dark [Music] the president thinks that china and the us share common interests in the denuclearization and maintaining peace on the korean peninsula great respect for the president of china i told him i said you'll make a much better deal on trey get rid of this menace or do something about the menace of north korea because that's what it is it's a menace right now the relationship between china and north korea has always been complicated china's mao zedong famously said that the two countries were as close as lips and teeth a relationship forged in blood and steel during the korean war against the united states the leaders have famously kept up with that appearance since the times of mao and north korea's founder kim il-sung and into the next generation with kim jong-il but something's changed kim jong-un since he came into power in 2012 this supposedly close relationship has chafed at the seams as leader kim has never left the country not even to visit beijing like his father and his grandfather had this is the last time kim was seen with a high-level chinese leader and it's been downhill since despite north korea's reliance on china mistrust has been brewing on both sides china and north korea share an 880 mile border split by two rivers the yalu and the two men both coming from the same source a slumbering super volcano straddling the border known to chinese as cheng baishan and to the koreans all koreans as mount pektu many believe this border is the lifeline of the north korean regime 90 of north korea's trade is with china i have been reporting from inside north korea for many years reporting will be closely watched but we expect to show you a country that the world knows very little about but we have rarely been allowed to leave their showcase capital of pyongyang to see the rest of the country i'm curious to find out exactly what we could see from over here our plan to travel the entire border or as far as we can from the yellow sea in the south to the regions rattled by pyongyang's nuclear testing in the north our starting point dandong it's a bustling unmistakably chinese city of commerce and condos connecting to the north korean city of synergy by a single bridge the sino-korean friendship bridge seventy percent of china north korea trade passes across this bridge despite u.n sanctions there is a steady stream of trucks and tourists going back and forth i would love to know what's inside these trucks what this trade is [Music] so i want to see where those trucks go when they come off the bridge i think they wind around and go into a transportation center maybe that's where they unload what they've gotten loaded up again in the morning [Music] yep written in korean licenses so these are clearly north korean looks like the the back is open let's see what they got in there these things may have already been unloaded [Music] so this was clearly something they loaded up took it over to north korea earlier today and then they just came back so they're probably gonna reload for tomorrow so all of these trucks have north korean license plates this was loaded up now it's empty thousands of curious chinese tourists descend on dan dong to gawk at the reclusive neighbors from across the yalu all along the river there are many tourist spots set up like some human safari what what did you see what do you think have you been there before you know it's you know you've never been there do you want to go there no no no no that's why we can't do whatever what do you think about all this nuclear testing [Music] oh i don't think they are as good as us you have better nuclear bombs in china than they do this site is called one leap across that's how close north korea is okay here's the border right across this field this says no drones flying over the border and look at this warning do not converse or exchange objects with people on the other side of the border they told us to be careful and warnings not to irritate the north koreans and don't even try crossing peering across glimpses of what appears to be normal life mundane but hypnotic at the same time there is a way to get even closer there's a lot of tourism so i guess we're going to go over the line into into north korea from here back and forth he says it's a unclear line in the middle of the river but this river is split china on this side north korea on that side we'll see if we run in any military the captain tells us we've technically entered north korean waters [Music] so none of this we can't shoot any of this [Music] [Music] is so this right here is where all the the generals houses are so it's kind of a joke they said if there's a conflict some kind of war that they can get a lot faster to china than the rest all around us another surprising sight no photos huh north korean boats filled with north korean products ginseng kimchi alcohol and cigarettes a sort of floating duty-free store cash only the other tourists in our boat were ready to shop you can see the shoes selling things right off the beach of north korea you can buy your cigarettes a lot cheaper but certainly not very safe all the money from this goes back to her to the people on shore back to the government official officially all right so we're told this is a pretty fancy north korean restaurant with north korean waitresses very north korean entertainment an estimated 40 000 north koreans work here in the don dong area and send cash back directly to the north korean government one of the highest profile jobs waitress and performers in north korean restaurants they kindly asked us not to video tape the waitress told us they live and work in china without their families for three years with the promise of getting better jobs in pyongyang when they get back but just outside of dandong the symbiotic relationship starts to show signs of fraying so we're just heading south of dundalk heading to what's called the new district this is where a brand new bridge has been under construction for the last seven years or so but it's just almost stopped it's slowed down and it's probably because of kim jong-un when the new leader came to power this was his father's project and it's just the buildings are not completely filled the construction is not what they thought it was going to be people are saying this is a catastrophe we meet xing jiang a truck driver who used to trade with north korean farmers and most recently helped in the construction of the new bridge he moved his family to this new district which was built for 400 000 new residents but only a quarter of that has shown up so he's going to take us now to his building where there were about 2 000 rooms that were supposed to be filled so we'll see what uh what his life is here in this new district korea everywhere so you're you're able to see normal north korean people we we we can never leave pyongyang kim jong-un is testing so many nuclear bombs and launching missiles is there is there much fear here what do you think will happen in this new district if if this relationship with china and north korea comes back to normal the bridge is not opened yet you look at this bridge this is supposed to be the great dream this is going to step up the relationship between these two countries china and north korea but it's just not opening this 350 million dollar project built by the chinese was expected to handle fifty thousand people and twenty thousand vehicles a day it now sits as a bridge to nowhere literally satellite pictures show that that bridge abruptly ends on the north korean side in a dirt field why why is it taking so long to open this bridge the one he brutally executed in 2013 for treason john championed closer economic integration with china and opening up north korea's economy this bridge was supposed to be the lynchpin [Music] you see that watch tower that's where the north koreans are staring at the chinese and the chinese have their video cameras on that tower right there to look at the north koreans as we drive north of dandong an unexpected scene the chinese military training on the river with bridging exercises guards lining the road to keep people from stopping a reminder that there are 150 000 chinese troops stationed along this border with their supposed ally china's biggest fear is that a regime collapse would bring refugees flooding over this border and u.s backed south korean troops right up to it this is a new great wall it was uh existing back in the 15th century but it went down they built in 1992 again as a as tourism so they say it's about 160 yards up to the top of this mountain and hopefully we'll be able to look out over the yalu river to see in north korea [Music] also right here this this farm area right here is uh that is north korea so this is absolutely the best view we've seen so far you can see there's the yellow river right on that side are all the buildings the successful economy of china and then this is north korea it's nothing but land agriculture and buildings so this is it this is just gorgeous are you afraid of these nuclear bombs that kim jong-un is developing you worried about it yeah very dangerous so what do you think we can do about it can we stop him from doing this [Music] foreign [Music] thank you our next stop is gian an ancient korean capital now on the chinese side of the border yeah so this is this is uh this is gian this place is bigger than i thought it was going to be unlike don dong tourism appears to have come to a halt in this town okay so this is gian i mean if you just look across the river you wonder why why can't they just swim over it's so close there's no cops there's no police why don't they just come over here and get on the get on the dock and walk in to freedom [Music] there have been defectors here but the border is tightening china sends back any defectors they catch there's a farmer right down here i mean you feel like you're back in the in the 1930s and north korea punishes the defector's entire family i don't think you see those kind of plows much anymore you never see any of those in the united states it's another one to see the difference so there's china on this side and there's north korea on the other you know you see the difference in wealth as we peer across the yalu a man who claims to be an out-of-work tour guide approaches us with an offer so this guy told us that they just stopped the one-day tours for tourists to come and go over to north korea for the last 45 days because of the tension they're not allowing anybody to go over to north korea he says he can take us close to it but we'll see it's gonna head about 12 kilometers down the street uh to the very edge of of gian and that's where the bridge is that goes over to the other country i've no idea who this guy is [Music] okay so we're going down underneath huh is he opening the gate so he's so he's claiming that he's sneaking us in underneath the bridge [Music] this guy's kind of mysterious where he's taking us what is this like a secret place do you know any defectors that have ever come here what is the tension is this tension because of the the nuclear tests so do you blame the americans more than the north koreans for stopping this tourism the annual joint military exercises between the u.s and south korea sends north korea into a defensive frenzy pyongyang the drills just over their southern border justifies their chase of missile and nukes at all costs in turn the chinese fault the drills for setting off north korea i would say this is two football fields away from north korea love to know who's in that nerves apparently calm the tour guide offers to take us further to the new bridge in town i don't know it's interesting that even even here in china they're blaming the united states for this tension almost as if it has nothing to do with north korea you know we could see that down in dandong where we just were there was there was tourism going back and forth there was a lot of trade we saw the trucks we saw the trains this might be completely different that's further north gm port people's republic of china uh military area but this is the bridge right here okay we're gonna get out here without much closer so is he concerned about the police that's a prison right there figure get ready for the war is that what kim jong-un said where do you hear that from he tells us his friends in the chinese military told him about the bridge which he says is just wide enough for two tanks to go across at the same time it's meant for the north korean generals to get over the border if the war breaks out once we get back in our vans the tour guide speeds off so this is a there's a military zone so we should probably get out of here so we just walk about a thousand yards along this train rail you'll end up in north korea yeah we should go as we leave the train tracks we get spotted by the chinese army outpost in the distance so i i guess it came true the the military came out and they stopped us and take us inside to their headquarters and they told us that we're in the military area and so we shouldn't be there but then they ultimately let us go they didn't take any of our recordings so i think we're good to go but we're just going to head up to another town to stay tonight instead of staying in engion so we'll see what happens next driving north we reach the source of the yalu river mount pektu i'm gonna go to the top of the mountain now this is perhaps the most sacred place for all koreans border here is split by this immense volcano known as changbaishan in chinese and pektusan in korean it is known as the spiritual home of the korean people every day when north korea state tv starts its programming the national anthem plays against images of mount pektu and the sacred lake chan which sits in its vast crater the volcano looms ever present in the daily lives of north koreans so much so that after their successful icbm launch in july news of its success was announced against the backdrop of none other than mount pektu test the firing of intercontinental ballistic rocket hasson 14 successful in fact the ruling kim family derives their legitimacy from the mountain kim jong-un's grandfather and father are often depicted standing on top of mount pektu their enduring myth says the sacred blood of mount pektu runs through the veins of the kim family and therefore they are the rightful chosen leaders of the korean people so we joined the busloads of tourists to hike to the top of the volcano it is according to mythology this is where the first king of the korean kingdom began he was born here also kim il-sung fought back the japanese during world war ii his son kim jong-il they say was born here although it should be said that the real records say that he was probably born in the soviet union but finally there's a very popular folk song [Music] my [Music] is [Music] [Applause] ah [Music] [Applause] you from south korea south korea what do you think about this oh yeah many of the tourists here are from south korea they only have access to their sacred mountain here on the china side whether you're in the north south this is the sacred place china north korea does this mean we're in north korea right now with the rest of the chinese tourists [Music] so there's this story in north korea that when kim jong-il died the ice in this lake cracked and it was so loud that it shook heaven and earth [Music] so that's the line that goes between this between china and north korea right there china only thing i see from north korea over there is on that ridge down from the peak a little building fence about 100 miles just over this ridge into north korea they say that they're that's where the location is for one of the nuclear test sites they've actually felt that when these things have belonged what's it like to be here right next to north korea for the first time i i see see the sight yeah how do you feel very exciting and one wonderful one person in korea i'm sad very sad someday it will be one korea again yes someday it will be let's go north korea [Music] [Applause] [Music] leaving mount pektu the border is now formed by the truman river so the signs all have both chinese and korea now we enter china's predominantly korean region half of china's two million ethnic koreans live in this region and this is yanji their largest city and much to china's chagrin this region feels the direct impact from pyongyang's nuclear testing let's get right to that breaking news successful nuclear test by north korea they claimed it overnight south korea confirms this is just the latest in a series of provocations from north korea it certainly is george this overnight test is believed to be the biggest yet last year as it did this september the ground shook here because of what happened just over the border students across yunji were evacuated out into the open at this high school we met this security guard who felt the shape it all happened right over here huh what what it was it was you're dancing around like this really really people evacuate do you think there's going to be another nuclear test on that site we turn and head towards the border towards the town of nanping along the river the tumen river is shallower and calmer than the yalu making it more manageable for defectors since the mid-1990s almost 30 000 north koreans have fled to china and in recent years violence and crime have also crossed the border they say that the the north korean soldiers are underpaid and underfed so that's one reason why they've been coming over the river to rob the people here and uh in china and in few cases in non-ping we run into a checkpoint [Music] he's looking through all of our bags who are they asking for they asking their boss no the security the national security it's especially fbi's yeah it's like the fbi the state security agent arrives [Music] this is about the border they didn't send me about the killings this can't be the same right and this is this must be different than it was months ago they said no no journalists at all even local they keep us on the side of the road for over an hour although they check every vehicle that passes our van was the only one they turn inside out after taking pictures of our team and our passports they let us go the ultimate decision was to turn us around send us back to where we came from and not allow us anywhere closer he said that we can go cannot go further because the border is not stable but it can elaborate oh the guy is following us will they be following us from from now on who knows but we're gonna maybe try a different route back to the border and see what's going as we go further north you know clearly in the south it was pretty easy we were not really uh stopped by any police or security but now the further we go north and we get closer to the more pure korean and towns then clearly it's getting a little bit more difficult they're more sensitive we later learned that just a month earlier seven defectors overpowered north korean border guards and crossed into china near nanping we make one last attempt for the border and head towards the border town of tuman named after the river we have yet to see we pass a sign saying just eight minutes to north korea this is another region kim jong-un's uncle had hoped to develop with china before his execution this is not far from the russian border this is wearable mountains of uh north korea city four 30-yard river to get across there it is song and kim jong-il the posters right on top of that building it's the first time we've seen that across the river this is the furthest north we've gotten so far it's probably the most narrow river and also most shallow the easiest ones to defect got the chinese flag and you got the north korean flag side by side is that why does she take that part out but once again they stopped us from shooting the security agent told us we had two choices leave or sightsee with the rest of the tourists no more reporting so we sightsee what we're really seeing is the further we go north the more strict they become here on the china side and you know the chinese came up to us and said we can't shoot we can't shoot anything across to the other side if they do the north koreans do see someone doing this they will complain to the authorities on this side the china side so it's obviously this guy's job to stop us from doing it we saw people with their cell phones taking video across the river but he said partly because i'm a foreigner that they're even more strict all right we're getting followed again this time by this black car i think probably until we get out of this town so this has been quite a trip i think we gotta wrap it up and head home all these towns are i think they're gonna be watching seeing if we're gonna come since our trip kim jong-un conducted north korea's sixth nuclear test in what appears to be open defiance of china beijing has committed to additional rounds of new u.n sanctions banning all imports of north korean coal seafood textiles and now capping pyongyang's fuel imports until beijing decides to really cut off the lifeline the trucks will still crisscross the bridge in dandong north korea will still find a way to send its workers and the empty bridges spanning their border stand ready for whatever they were supposedly built for fears on the chinese side of the border are not over imminent war but the disruption of their livelihood china's reluctant tolerance of kim jong-un and the inconvenience status quo has always been and always will be about stability within their own borders
