so when i saw victoria's secrets mother i thought they were so ugly in north korea i never heard the word sexy in north korea skinny ways is not something desired [Music] hi everyone welcome to my channel today in this video i am going to talk about something so interesting and fun many of you have left comments in my previous videos asked me about north korea's beauty standard how does it differ from here so let's see how is it different than north korean people think someone's beautiful now so number one the face shape in south korea i learned term called v line so if someone's face has like a v-shaped bottom here they think it's very pretty and in in south korea also they think if your face like here round like me it's really not pretty but when i came to america people think like a high cheekbones is like something attractive so all right good for me now but then let's see what's going on in north korea's beauty standard in north korea they think someone with the moon-shaped face is beautiful so we always think someone is beautiful we compare them oh she's beautiful like the moon north korea do like the p like people with pear skins like lighter skin so we don't like to get a tan so a lot of women like later women in pyongyang using these umbrellas to protect from their face from the sun and now i'm so americanized i like to get a tan here but not in north korea we do like we do something like really moon shaped round face with a pear skin and on the face yes north koreans do think someone with big eyes are beautiful but now when it comes to the mouth the leaves here in america i heard people like the like full big leaves but in north korea we like someone's lips like a tiny cherry in a small cherry like really tiny mouth is something we think is very pretty so when you uh you know recruit actresses or actors they they say if someone's standing on the stage like 50 meters ahead can you see their face if you see their face then that person is right for that job so they do really like person not really small face like the south koreans but a little bit like size faced i never heard like in north korea that you if your face is like small like like this is pretty because we never talked about really face size we talked about shade maybe the random shade but never saying thinking you know if someone has a big face that is like something unattractive i never heard that before so it was so shocking for me everyone's keep talking about my like face size in south korea i was like what the heck are you talking about like what's wrong with you with my my face so now let's see the body type i have like a lot to talk about when it comes to body type because we don't have a lot of food in the countryside and even in pyongyang not that many people can be the size of kim jong-un so i didn't really growing up seeing ever in my life seeing someone like that overweight i saw like kim jong-il on tv who was pretty big but other than that in my real life usually women's average body weight was like over 50 kilograms then we think oh they're pretty good size and my mom was always like something around 40 kilograms like now i'm like 37 kilograms so like so i'm like so so skinny for their standard and a lot of my friends were like in their 40 kilo kilogram standard too and i think that's like less than maybe around 100 pounds and that was like average for girls and men too they are so skinny therefore if someone with like big belly and like really bored hair that means power they are very attractive i it's like a really embarrassing confession for me to have when i was in north korea my ideal man whose body type was actually kim jong-un oh my god it's so embarrassing but because like you know it's like that's why i learned that like we should not be a very judgmental when we like comes to seeing other people's culture the culture is influenced by so many factors north korean beauty standard have been influenced by how much lack of food people had so therefore if someone has like big belly or big you know big like chubby a little bit then that's such a good thing because like most people are not you know like when like i think people's psychology we just want things that we don't usually have so therefore not a lot of people had a big like bodies you know mass so we just want if that was something considered to be pretty and a lot of parts about women here in the west or in south korea hair women with like big breasts is something considered very desirable and sexy in north korea i never heard the word sexy i was like when someone told me like sexy words like what is sexy you know and so like that in school when girls start having you know your breasts when you're in teenager time then it's very embarrassing like guys make fun of you and so it was a very very tradition like my mom had to tie herself when she was becoming you know like showing like her body shape and like my time too we had like shady like tidy so tight so like other people cannot sit and guys could like boys in school couldn't make fun of us but here people like think that's so beautiful like you know i think it's really wonderful that i hear people don't shame body like women's body as much than in north korea here just people think you know you're beautiful if you have breasts but also i think here people can be very picky too another part people here want i mean in south carolina like as the shape like it's beautiful so because you know you are like deep breaths like big big heap and like very skinny waist in north korea skinny ways is not something desired like i heard so many times guys saying oh i like women who have a little bit you know weight in your their stomach so they can like play with it they don't like bony women so guys said oh she's too bunny that means like oh i don't find her that attractive so when i saw victoria's secret's mother i thought they were so ugly so they were so boring i was like they are so skinny why do you think that's pretty now i mean for me they're like goddess they're gorgeous but back then just coming out of north korea looking at these motor motors in the west they looked really not that pretty to me lastly what i like about beauty standard in the west is that you know especially in america korea south korea was very homogeneous that you really had to look like everyone else dressed like everyone else you could not really look different than other people but here america really embraced this idea of diversity you don't have to have the same skin color you don't have to have the same naked shape of the face or body you know like now if you go like even target like go they are like plus size plus size motors they are you know petty sized motors and there are people with so many ethnicity that represents you know different ways i think that's so beautiful you know we don't have to be the one way or the other way and be so judgmental when it comes to you know someone else's body or other person's like culture and i really hope that like even south korea and north korea i do truly think they have a lot to learn from recent new new trend in america where we try to be you know so inclusive so thank you guys for watching my videos as always and as you can see you know whenever you leave comments i do try to make all those comments and be part of my videos so keep leaving comments i look forward to seeing you guys next time so be safe and see you next time love you guys bye
