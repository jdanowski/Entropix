so we're here in pyongyang north korea we're at the hotel pyongyang koryo which is one of a small handful of hotels that foreigners are allowed to stay at and this is day one of my visit to north korea so i don't have much basis for comparison but from what i've been told this is one of the top hotels in all of north korea it's super luxurious you'll see in a second i'm standing outside right at the street and i've been told that i can't step any further beyond this stone sort of line there that's the hotel property uh like none of the guests here are allowed past that line and we're certainly not allowed to wander off into the city even though we're in the middle of the downtown area so as our as our guide told us we're kind of in our gilded prison here and you'll see what i mean in a second it's pretty opulent inside uh but why don't we go check it out so here we go revolving glass elevator very nice touch and here we are in the lobby as you can see there isn't really one way to describe the architecture here it's kind of a tacky disco retro 70s thing going on but as you can see this place is massive glass dome and everything i mean on the surface level they did a great job the really interesting thing is there's actually two towers to this hotel i think each tower has around 20-ish 20-some floors and there's a bridge that connects the two towers at the very top i wish i could take you on that bridge but unfortunately no one's allowed on that bridge right now there was just a fire a couple months ago on that bridge and um uh and that fire was actually pretty famously covered by a bunch of tourists who were actually staying at this hotel at the time they got a whole bunch of trouble because they shared it on social media and i think ended up getting in a whole bunch of trouble with the police so let's try not to have that happen again but as a result uh no visit to the bridge this is the reception desk and uh let's go deeper into the atrium now this is pretty opulent as you can see there's just mirrors everywhere and these kind of rainbow disco lights going on sort of giant landscape fresco [Music] you'll see a lot of those in north korea [Music] uh so a couple a little while ago i guess a couple years ago revolving restaurants were a thing in north korea and so a bunch of the really nice high-end hotels ended up building these revolving restaurants so since i couldn't show you a picture of the hotel from the outside here's a here's a drawing of it uh that's the very top and you can see one of them is like a circular revolving restaurant thing apparently the food isn't very good but i haven't tried it myself here's this sort of disco rainbow saturday night night fever kind of thing going on here it's like a water fountain thing all right we're going to go up to the my room here this is tower one and i'm going to uh there we go all right now we have to wait actually as we wait let's just take another look there's apparently a fitness club on the lower level but they only open at 10 am which means that none of the tours can oh wow that's a fast elevator wait oh my god all right just chopped off my hand here all right i think i'm on 18. so yeah there are i was incorrect there's 32 floors and then apparently room for expansion they decided to build more towers but yeah it's a tall it's a tall tower i think this is one of the taller buildings in pyongyang i don't really know for sure but from the outside we were arriving it looked like that for sure so here we go we're uh about to arrive at the 18th floor [Music] and here we go so now we're in the elevator lobby here's the view from the lobby elevator and you can see it's just this sort of stark architecture from the outside this is uh this is a tower too that we're looking at right now so this is the the sister tower of the one we're standing in the other half of the hotel what's really interesting is if you look there the lower floors are where our handlers and the locals live when they're visiting when they're when they're hosting us and i guess you can't really get a good look at that but um it's a completely different environment than uh the one that we're staying in uh when i one of the elevators that i took actually opened up on the on the lower floor as i was coming up in the first time and there was like a ping pong table set up right where we were just standing in the lobby which was kind of funny all right sort of a dark creepy hallway probably maybe conserving some power and here we go to room 1807 and this is our uh our key card to get in so here we go it's dark in fact this is kind of how it was when i first got in so kind of a weird thing the key is pretty cool they actually did a full electronic key card system look at that let's shut this door because it's beeping at me okay let's take a tour of the room shall we let's turn on some more lights oh creepy dark bathroom let's turn the light alright so pretty standard kind of old-school bathroom you got your toilet your sink um really low ceilings i'm gonna hit my head almost as i walk into this i'm gonna stoop down here so you can take a look there's this old school sort of shower head thing uh you've got your kind of standard amenities kit going on shampoo conditioner and bath foam and all that goodness and some soap i don't know how good it is but we'll find out there's a there's a kleenex box holder but no kleenex hope you don't have a runny nose or anything when you come visit north korea uh it's dark here and i don't know how to turn on oh here we go let's turn on this light so what you have here is kind of this like uh sort of sitting area lounge room tea room coffee nook i don't know how you call it it's got like a step to get up and you've got your chairs and this view of a construction site which i won't show well briefly dip but they're not a huge fan of construction sites being shown and look at that sunset pretty incredible right and then you got some really crazy factory smokestack action going on in the background right on the horizon there uh it can't be good to breathe that's probably only just a few miles away from here uh and but hey it looks it makes for a beautiful sort of sunset visual all right as we move out of this coffee nook space let's go check out the bedroom uh you got your two beds here you've got this refrigerator which i checked earlier i was kind of excited about the fridge except it's not on it doesn't actually work i cranked it up to max about an hour ago and it's still hot so yeah but you know it's a nice sort of showpiece i guess and you got let me see if i can turn on some more lights here yeah that's that's all we got you got your north korea calendar pretty cool uh yeah there we go that'd be a nice little souvenir if anyone actually wanted to jack the camera a calendar yes uh you can control your well actually i don't even know what these things do let's see so you got some controls down here for your bed foot room sorry as i'm clicking these things nothing's actually happening tv did not turn on oh that works little dimmer switch for the bed that's nice volume control for the radio so it's am1 they have am1 m2 bgm1 which background music perhaps uh which is nothing bgm2 off so really nothing on the radio right now i don't know if anything ever is on that's all you get kind of like this arcade game background noise thing i'm gonna turn that off this is dragging bunkers and then uh you got your clock which uh is telling the right time the funny story about the clock right here 647. just a few weeks ago north korea decided to change their time zone to their own and shifted their time half an hour later than beijing um so yeah it's actually 6 10 or 6 to 15 p.m in beijing right now but it's uh 6 15 and 6 645 in pyongyang so it goes it's good to make your own rules you got your tv here which we'll check in a second but here's that sort of picture window action going on again that beautiful sunset but uh let's see what's on tv this i haven't done either yet oh actually let's turn on some more lights okay that's better all right let's see what we have all right so that was a good sign whoa i think it's the brand of the tv it's the same [Music] uh channel's not coming in clearly oh bbc world news wow [Music] all right so i'm guessing these channels aren't available to pretty impressive russian russian tv here chinese tv cctv cctv more this is incredible so hey you know maybe they'll uh maybe they can find some hbo as well so there you have it that's the room thanks for watching and thanks for visiting with me here in pyongyang thanks
