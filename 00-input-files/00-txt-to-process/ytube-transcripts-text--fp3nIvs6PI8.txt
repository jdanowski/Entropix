since 2017 battle royale games have been all the rage with huge titles like pub G minecraft Hunger Games fortnight and recently apex legends taking the throne for the most played game you might know that these games pit up to 100 players against each other individually or in squads to fight to the death and see who can be crowned winner but what you might not have known is that this new generation of video game is helping topple dictatorship regimes all over the world such as in North Korea [Music] so how are battle royale games like apex legends and fortnight helping to overthrow some of the world's most elusive dictators like Kim jong-un to woods flute rule codification you're hearing the voice of a special agent of the CIA who is asked to remain anonymous who will be calling agent doe for the purposes of this video virtual codification is a process in which two agents across the world will cue into a battle royale match on the same squad in order to pass on intelligence to one another agent doe says that virtual codification is a much more effective method of passing on intelligence from one agent to the other because of recent advances in code cracking and hacking technology that makes it harder for agents to send each other Intel through government servers you know one might have agents say at HQ in Virginia and you might have another undercover agent in Pyongyang working on a plot to dethrone the Kim jong-un so the benefit of passing on information to one another in something like say a VAX legends is that the North Korean government probably doesn't even know to be checking something like apex legends for intelligence that could compromise its dictatorship the reason Battle Royale games like apex legends and fortnight are allowed to exist in North Korea Kim jong-un is a huge fan himself according to some analysts Kim jong-un has been known to play upwards of 12 hours a day on the weekends once in a squad agents will talk to each other through in-game chat one of the only places left in the world that doesn't record conversation data this adds another layer of safety to virtual codifications because like we can't just text each other like hey SEAL team says tonight are you something Google related because what are things we say could surface and leaks and get us killed or even worse fired the world of virtual codification is complex and dynamic and regular intended game functions and expressions take on a whole new meaning for example I knocked one means someone is holding a gun to my head in fortnight some agents will build structures that spell out certain codes and across various other battle Royales some will encrypt code into the game's chat function again not stored of course virtual codification is not without its detractors there have been a few very outspoken complaints about the entire system calling it convoluted and dangerous multiple disputes over whether or not apex legends or fortnight should be home to the virtual codification system have been held and it doesn't look like it's a debate that's going to go away anytime soon some detractors have also firmly maintained that minecraft hunger games should be used as it allows for much more expressive communication and quote is not a game for reportedly apex legends has since partnered with the CIA NSA FBI and other various agencies around the world such as CSIS NIS F is G IGN mi6 Asus gsg-9 s tu GE ou and so forth apex legends will be adding special pings to the game for these operatives to communicate with each other more efficiently reportedly one ping will signal that an agent is in hot pursuit of a person of interest while the pings can't be added to individual accounts for fear of compromised identities respawn the company that publishes apex Legends has respectfully asked that no one else used these special pings while digital codification is still in its infancy many agencies all over the world are looking towards video games for the future of covert communication with games like roblox dota 2 and even hearthstone on the radar one thing's for sure Kim jong-un and other dictators have their days number you're hearing the voice of a spy oh my god [Music] it's all over now it's all over now mean it
