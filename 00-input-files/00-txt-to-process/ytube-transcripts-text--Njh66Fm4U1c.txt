[Music] hello and welcome to crosstalk where all things are considered I'm Peter labelled summit or no summit that's the question North Korea's threat of a no-show in Singapore on June 12th is a reminder to Washington that North Korea will not merely cave to American demands or should I say John Bolton's demands if there's going to be an agreement it's going to take time and patience do the Americans and the North Koreans have enough of either [Music] cross knocking the upcoming summit I'm joined by my guest Kevin Martin in Washington he is president of Peace Action and Peace Action Education Fund as well as coordinator of the Korea Peace Network also in Washington we have Jenny Town she is managing editor of 38north and in Boston we cross to mu cang he is an assistant professor at Baruch College City University of New York and a specialist on Korea and Asian affairs all right crosstalk rolls in effect that means you can jump in any time you want and I always appreciate it Jamie Jenny let me go to you first here do you think there's still going to be a summit or or we just get in the and the preamble process of you know everybody's kind of feeling everyone out and finding out what the the lay of the land because I think would be cable stations in the u.s. tend to over react to all kinds of things go ahead Jenny they mean they definitely overreact and the fact that we haven't heard this coming from Kim jong-un himself I would assume that some across the summit process is still moving and that we should still expect it to happen but I think it is a reminder that you know there are obligations on all sides I mean the North Koreans are not simply as you said not simply just going to do things unilaterally they do expect reciprocation it will take time and they're not interested in a model especially the Libyan model where you know it ended up with the deposition of deposing of Qaddafi and so but this idea too is that you know they also expect to have reciprocal actions along the way not simply at the end of a process and I think you know that needs to be taken into account even in the messaging as we move forward you know Kevin more or less the same question to you because yet again I think the a lot of nuance is lacking in the in the coverage of this very very important story is that the perception is that the North Koreans have there's preconditions like surrender give up all of your weapons your program and then we can talk now any rational person that has on any understand of international relations and diplomacy which unfortunately is terribly lacking at times in Washington knows that it's a tit for tat it's a learning process you have to start learning to trust each other that's step one go had Kevin well and I think it's important to remember that the most important president in this process is president moon of South Korea not President Trump of the United States it's always all about Trump right everything is always all about Trump except this isn't president moon is not only trying to bring about peace and diplomacy on the peninsula he's trying to reclaim more independence and sovereignty in a relationship with the unipolar world superpower and so far he's been doing it extremely deftly and I think we should be looking to the meeting here in Washington on May 22nd between Trump and moon as a very important step in setting the stage for later talks including the son between Trump and Kim okay let's go - let's go to Boston professor I mean more or less the same question again to you here I mean with the added caveat is how much is American domestic politics playing in this because again if you look at the mainstream media the liberal media they have a hard time digesting this story that Trump could be part of a peacemaking world to store a covet here they're very hesitant I mean I'm agnostic I'm for peace okay I don't care who gets you there okay but that's not the case in American domestic politics go ahead professor in Boston right as you pointed out here in the United States particularly in the mainstream news media don't want to give real credit to President Trump that seemed such a case but as Jenny pointed out the important thing is that the statement you know criticizing John Bolton or even canceling the summit meeting not came from directly from Kim jong-un but from counterpart diplomat you know John Bolton in the past Kim kye-gwan so such kind of individual statement highlight that the North Korean government officially still is very much interested in the comings I mean meeting with the president Trump I think that's that that's the case okay Jenny what do you think that the first steps are going to be because unfortunately and and maybe this is because of the balton effect and just the perceptions of North Korea in general you know the end result is a nuclear penninsula I think that's the ultimate goal but that's gonna take a long time to get there the stationing of American troops in the south so far the North has not really put a whole lot of demands on that but we know that that will probably be part of the process as well I mean what we know is this summit that's coming up in Singapore it's not going to decide everything it might start the process deciding something and I think that's the way it should be looked at go ahead Jenny yeah no I think you're exactly right is that you know this summit is not a one-off it's not supposed to solve all of the problems there's only so much you can do in a one-day meeting at a high-level meeting you're not going to get into the details and this has been part of the problem is that this isn't necessarily how the US does diplomacy and so it's been a very uncomfortable and very uncertain process along the way normally this would come after you've already negotiated all the details rather than setting the mandate and the objectives of what has to be in a deal so I think you know there's a lot here that is very uncertain I think there's been very bad expectation management along the way coming from both the US as well as the South Korean government raising expectations too high and I think you know along this way we have to understand that there's a lot that comes out in public messaging that isn't necessarily what's being talked about behind closed doors because it is a negotiation and neither side is going to publicly publicly talk about the full range of things where there is room for negotiation because obviously they're not going to show their hand so I think we need to keep perspective and keep our expectations you know realistic as to what we expect to see and yes there might be some concrete moves made at the beginning hopefully there are some you know very clear objectives of what has to be included in a deal and then it gets passed down to the negotiators to actually work out the details a very good point you know Kevin when Trump decided to pull out of the Iran deal if you if you look at his reasoning it had nothing to do with the AG the deal itself the IAEA gave gave a clean bill of health to Turan and everything he talked about with other things and if we could use the analogy of a basket he wanted to put more eggs in the basket missiles human rights all these things here do you fear that this is what the political class is gonna do to be a spoiler because you know we can all speculate what John Bolton's role in this is we don't know he hasn't been in the job very long okay but I mean I worry that these extra things will be added okay regime change the type of regime of the type of system that's gonna be that's gonna sour everything we should be very focused on one thing and that might may be just might be doable Kevin well I don't think Bolton's role is going to be positive or good and certainly people that have studied this issue you have know that he helped to scuttle the last agreement that was negotiated under the Clinton administration the agreed framework when he was in the Bush administration I have to say though that the recent protests by the North Korean government of the u.s. South Korean war exercises makes all the sense in the world for them to have complain why the world we have to do these twice a year largest military exercises in the world we're not sure that our stuff is going to work what are my tax dollars paying for and the fact that it was reported that the f-22s and b-52s were used of course it looks to North Korea like a practice for an invasion or a decapitation strike so the part of the problem is the United States has no humility we're the number one superpower the war machine runs on autopilot if we have these planes ready to fly in these military exercises we're gonna do them and eat our dust and like it you know and that just doesn't set a good tone for diplomacy and I think when you had the great thaw with the Olympic truce and at first North Korea not complaining about the war exercises the earlier version of the war exercises that was an astonishing concession by them and then we have to rub their nose in it by saying okay well now these Air Force exercises are going to include the f-22s and b-52s although I did see a report yesterday that maybe they're gonna pull back the b-52s but it doesn't set a good precedent to go ahead and do this and rub North Korea's nose in it we're about to go into diplomacy exactly let's go back to the professor in Boston one of the problems we have here is that unfortunately in particularly in since the end of the Cold War diplomacy is often equated with appeasement and I think we need to get it away from that if we're gonna make any kind of progress go ahead in Boston yeah that's very important point I mean John Bolton was the guy who used the appeasement and he preferred regime change or military option in solving the problem as we know well and then he was the guy who described a great framework of 1994 as a kind of appeasement and also the nuclear Iran deal also appeasement but if we want to genuinely solve the situation in a peaceful way you know a couple of you know interaction and diplomatic matters will be necessary as Jenny pointed out you know two things seems to be really important one is how to manage expectation inflate expectation in United States especially in South Korea and also how to deal with uncertainty imports of masses we have to think about is how to deal with you know uncertain or risky outcomes ultimately in such kind of situations actors will try to minimize the loss not maximizing the gain so at this kind of you know some precarious and uncertain situation about the final outcome of the summit meeting and the following diplomatic negotiations between the United States and North Korea we need to increase in a more communication because Trust building some sort of understanding or mutual understanding is essential process and for that personal communication communication is basically means in a more diplomatic interactions in every levels in not just in a summit level but at the same time high ranking in the military and economic aspect in every you know levels of you know communication okay we're gonna I'm gonna jump in here we're gonna go to a short break we're gonna go to a short break and after that short break we'll continue our discussion on the upcoming summit stay with our team [Music] welcome back to crosswalk where all things are considered on Peter LaBelle to remind you were discussing the upcoming summit [Music] okay let's go to Kevin at the very last second you wanted to jump in so you can jump in now go ahead Kevin in Washington yeah just to follow up on the professor's comment I thought it was very interesting and important that moon show him who's the special advisor to president moon in South Korea his statement after the North Korean statement of concern and postponing the meeting that was supposed to happen with South Korea said that South Korea will continue to be an aggressive mediator and I thought that was very important and very hopeful now no one's been a control trump right but I think we especially people that do want peace and I'm like Peter I'm agnostic I'm no fan of Trump but if he brings about peace I'm all for any to those of us who really advocate peace and want to see a resolution it's about Koreans making peace it's not about what Trump wants now Trump's ego always gets in the way of everything but if Trump in the United States can't support Koreans making peace then we need to stay out of it completely agreed that I I think this is what again the mainstream media can't get their head around that it's about the Korean People's North and South first and foremost okay and then the u.s. as the interloper here Jenny you wanted also react go ahead jump in well I mean I'm not sure I necessarily agree with that completely okay because the u.s. does play a big role here because the North Koreans believe the u.s. plays a big role here and so yes there has been movement on inter-korean relations but at the end of the day the North Koreans don't look to South Korea to to really solve security issues because the enemy still really is the United States and that is sort of the core of their identity in the core of their worries I wanted to piggyback on the professor's comments as well to say that you know I think there is a problem here and the problem is with the consistency of messaging and in an active negotiation process you can't have these competing narratives you know Bolton is no longer a Fox News commentator he is now the National Security Advisor and so what he says carries weight and so if you're negotiating with the Secretary of State and he is telling you one thing and then you have the National Security Advisor saying something completely different on public you know in in the public in the media regardless of whether not he's actually involved in the process this works to undermine any confidence in what the Secretary of State is saying and so this has been a problem with the Trump administration since the beginning is that there's no consistency there's no discipline and now when we are in active negotiations it is important to rein those messages in you know professor yeah I'm really glad that Jenny said that because my perception is and again I don't know how much we should weigh Bolton's words it's still early days in his tenure but one of the things I think is very interesting is that I get to perception in looking at the cable news and so-called experts they're always experts on everything but they never get anything right the perception the perception is is that you know there's going to be some kind of unification but under American terms and that there's going to be the end of the North Korean regime and the US will keep its troops there and it's those troops welcome we'll go all the way up to China I mean this is this fairy tale that they think they actually believe it ok and I and I and obviously the north will not allow that happen and China certainly would not be interested in that I know I I agree with Jenny we have these very different narratives and they should be coming together and not in parallel during these negotiations go ahead professor in Boston yeah as you guys pointed out there's a huge perception gap but let me highlight in a perception gap going on between here in the United States and South Korea from the South Korean people's point of view of course no nuclear capability of North Korea is a big deal but conventionally in North in South Korea already has been placed in a kind of balance of terror situation if one side initiate any kind of full-blown war the other side would be you know both lives would be completely annihilated so South Korean people are fully aware of such kind of risk or damages in that such kind of situations and having a nuclear capability of North Korea of course it adds more you know some concerns but not like here in the United States so here in denies that what Japan nuclear north is a kind of new threat and then it looks like an impending threat but at least to the majority of South Korean people of course it's very important issue and we need to take care of it but it's not such a kind of impending issue like in the United States yeah so how to narrow down these different position gap it's in the two countries and the people and leaders of these two countries are very very important I agree completely here Kevin one of the things that I think is an impediment to all of this and I'll just use the shorthand term deep state needs a deep state in the United States is it if there is peace you know breaks out on the peninsula what is the usefulness of having American troops there and then you look at all of the entangling alliances the United States has in the Pacific we think about Taiwan think about Japan and they're gonna be saying oh well they're gonna leave there were they gonna leave us behind and then you know you this could start an arms race here I'm much like with Saudi Arabia if Iran decides to walk away from the the great deal that was in play do you think this is really one of the major concerns they're not really concerned in the Pentagon for example they're not particularly interested in the Korean people but they're interested in their strategic positioning and South Korea is one big strategic position for the United States in the world go ahead well I'm also connecting to the previous point you should not expect consistency out of the Trump administration they're incompetent they don't know what they're doing they've never done anything like this I do tend to take a more positive view because of my connection to people's movements in the region remember this was a People's Movement that got rid of the prior former conservative president of South Korea and and moon ran on a revival of the sunshine policy and negotiating with the north and now he's wildly popular he's the most popular leader in the in the world he's over 85 percent popularity I think including for his negotiations with North Korea but also you have a strong people's moving on against the u.s. south korean base on jeju island against the phat anti-missile system which is seem to be very provocative you have strong people's movements in japan against US military presents particularly in Okinawa and if we see some diplomatic progress it could lead the way to something like a Northeast Asia nuclear weapons-free zone now I'm not naive about outside interests and the big government for example maybe is a little bit nervous about what's sharing on certainly China has an important role to play maybe a positive role as a guarantor of North Korean security as they move towards if they move towards denuclearization so there all sorts of ways this could go but piece has a proliferating effect I think as do missiles or look so and I think if we do make progress towards peace then that may spread through the region and you could have something that that might be at Northeast Asian nuclear freeze on now the only thing about that is the United States with our land-based ICBMs and our submarine-based missiles all over the world can obliterate North Korea or any target anytime they want we want so to say denuclearization of the peninsula what exactly does that mean when the United States can hit targets anyplace within 30 minutes or whatever so that has to be taken into account so I do think China has a role to play a deterrent role or a guarantor of North Korea's security if North Korea is going to give up this asset so I think that's probably I think that's why the Kim jong-un made two trips through Beijing probably to get that clear Jenny I I'm so glad that everyone here is mentioned president moon because I think he's a real life hero talk us through the strategy he has to be very very careful and he has to finesse a lot of things here he's doing a good job so far what do you expect to happen moving forward what is he gonna have to do and what does he have to worry about go ahead well you know I think he made the right moves you know during the Olympics to be able to have those direct inter-korean talks and then to be able to move that from a talk about the Olympics into more broader security interests and so I think you know he's done that part right he endure door to diplomacy he made sure that the US was also at the table but now the problem is of course that now you know we do have the Pamuk John declaration there is a lot of ambiguity within it but it does build obligations again and and moon needs to be conscious of that and needs to be conscious of not just what South Korea wants out of this process but what North Korean expectations are and I think this is what you've seen now over the past couple of days is you know when when North Korea is now protesting the idea that they're using strategic strategic assets in a military drill this does not bode well for the spirit of the penguin jump declaration and this could fall apart easily we've seen it fall apart in the past and so there has to be you know greater concern now as to you know what are both sides thinking what are the expectations how do we continue down a positive path you know a professor you know one of the things that you know that is very valuable when you are in negotiations like this is to be able to imagine being in the other guys shoes okay this is a kind of dialogue here but you know I don't see that in in in Western policymaking they could never imagine themselves in the you know that you know the American people Western public zone I don't even think and realize that North Korea is surrounded by some of the most sophisticated military hardware in the world the biggest military exercises in the world and you know there's this perception you know that that somehow the the West is gonna tame the north and and everyone's gonna sing around the campfire singing Kumbaya it's gonna be a lot more difficult than that and I think and I don't think the public's are being prepared for that because anything doing anything like not flying the b-52 so that's a concession you're conceding that's appeasement that's exactly what you get and I and this is this is what's really dangerous here because the the trumpet is gonna be boxed in you know I can't like I'm agnostic about Trump but I do believe in a process here go ahead professor right I mean great point I mean it's always very difficult to understand the other side the front the other side in a point of view but as you pointed out we need to think about in a North Korean perspective quite seriously it's not necessarily you know justifying the regime itself that the threat North Korean people or the regime might feel from the United States so as you pointed out you know for instance let's go back to the North Korea nuclear weapons program I mean their conventional weapons system is pretty all the economic power is pretty old and then not that strong at all so in that context the nuclear weapon may be the only guarantee or regime or in a security guarantee they might think like that so here in the United States we try to understand a North Korean nuclear program as a kind of aggressive offensive kind of program but from the North Korean perspective I think they're not going to use in a nuclear weapons to conquer or annihilate the entire United States if that's the case in a North Korean regime will disappear from on earth it's quite for sure so so basically why the ten percent of ten percent of North Korean you know Elliott you know the Korean workers party people if they want to make a you know collective suicide and they're gonna use the nuclear weapon against the United States if that's not the case they're gonna use it so here's one Kang I'm sorry I have to jump in here this program always flies excellent guests excellent discussion many thanks to my guests in Washington and in Boston and thanks
