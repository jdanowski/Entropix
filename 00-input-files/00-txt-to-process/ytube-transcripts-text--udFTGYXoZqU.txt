you are about to enter a very dangerous game where a tiny mistake could mean the end welcome to escaping north korea what seems like the easiest way is to cross the demilitarized zone to go to south korea but this is actually one of the most dangerous routes around 2 million troops guard the border on both sides and even if you manage to hide from their guns you could still step on a landmine or get electrocuted on the fences that is why ironically it's often the soldiers themselves who run through this border to leave the cruel kingdom of king jong-un so what is the next option of escape for north koreans testing the waters remember you are riding a small boat in a big big sea you can test your fate through the west coast which is easier to navigate but be extra careful here because kim's naval patrols will have their eyes on you it can be even more risky over at the east coast but at least if you drift too far away you could end up in japan which unlike china will not send you back home and if your boat eventually breaks down hell you have no choice but to swim to south korea now if that sounds too dangerous you could try doing work abroad labor camps yes sometimes north korea sends workers to countries like china or russia to do back-breaking inhumane work in depressing labor camps you only have to convince the government you're physically fit for the job oh and you also have to prove you have a wife and kids so they will have someone to take hostage if you dare to get out that's why in this north korean game life gets a lot easier if you have money there are not too many of them but rich north koreans sometimes want to run away from the regime to live life to the fullest and for them it's like hacking the game they can use their money to bribe patrolmen study abroad and flee or produce fake passports and ideas while hiding in another country but if all of these game options don't suit you here is your last shot at freedom first you have to cross the northern border to china by somehow surviving a dangerous river if by some miracle you enter china alive you will have to quickly plan how you can leave it that is before chinese guards arrest you and send you back to north korea or end up selling you as a slave for chinese men now quick let's talk about your three ways to freedom in china a run as fast as you can to the south korean embassy in beijing outsmart the very strict guards and get your body past the gate remember just one slip or a second too late and it's game over b contact an underground network of activists who will help you with secret routes to southeast asia from there just wish that your country of choice has a good enough relationship with south korea to send you on a plane to seoul not pyongyang c take the shorter but much more deadly route via gobi desert this was the golden journey for a famous north korean defectory on me park north koreans right now cannot speak for themselves they don't have internet in 21st century we don't have electricity and it is the darkest place on earth right now night farm this was the dangerous north korean escape game and it's our luck that we never had to play it so the next time you take your life for granted remember there are literally people out there risking their lives to simply have a life [Music]
