no songs Hamo you give me some paisa Hong Kong that's North Korea for you the world's most secretive state and we're going to go there and check it out for ourselves but we're here at denden which is the closest you can get to North Korea from China this bridge good morning they put us at a hotel on an island one thing you notice about North Korea is that the streets are mostly empty because nobody can afford cars there's literally no traffic jams while the roads are incredibly crowded in places like China this is the main highway of North Korea is literally very few cars so World War two ended Japan lost control of Korea and in the Soviet Union and the United States communism versus capitalism didn't know what to do with the Korean Peninsula so they split it this split between North and South Korea was very arbitrary that's the line that separates north from South this line and it's 70 years of existence North Korea has been ruled by only three people Kim Il Sung Kim jong-il and Kim Jong hoon three people currently under the control of Kim jong-un the government and the country is enjoying - well there's no internet no books no TV shows no Justin Bieber heck there's barely enough electricity in the country power went off again this place is such a closed community that everything that produced is produced internally which means there's no trade or very little trade with other nations so products like cannot be made here oh can that be even found and when it comes to religion North Korea banned all of those no Islam no Hinduism no Judaism no Christianity inside the country basically North Koreans do not believe in God North Korea is such a prison that going in they check your iPhone your laptop your iPad to make sure you don't smuggle anything in that they don't want I pass the laptops everything with the culture of North Koreans is something to be proud of things like dancing - dancing to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the Workers Party foundation great friendly people and say hi hi welcome to Napoli take a picture of your dress I'm taking a picture right now beautiful weddings great football matches they even have a circus it's something that cannot be found anywhere else despite the government situation the 10th of October is a special day that's when North Korea has a military parade celebrating seven years of existence for the Workers Party that's why we're going and now we're going to see the parade going back seven years formation you and that was the parade a bunch of 1950s Soviet Union weapons and a government that thinks it can take over the world at the end of the day North Korea is one of the poorest in the world there's too much emphasis on monuments like Kim il-sung and too little on the people my love
