i really so grateful that i'm in the world where there is a word for feminism or even ladies first there was never such a time i heard like ladies first in north korea every time is men first if you household has a bicycle in north korea like at least where i was in the middle class in the countryside it is almost equivalent owning a you know bmw or sedan [Music] hi everyone welcome to my channel my name is yanmee park i'm a north korean defector human rights activist today in this video i'm going to talk about something very personal to me about women's lives in north korea north korean regime says north korea is a paradise for women and i will tell you why it's not there are seven the most ridiculous things that you cannot do because you are simply women in north korea right now number one no pants rule because wearing pants is not womenly enough in the eyes of men in north korea i remember my aunt was selling fish in the black market and in the market when you do this kind of business we don't have trucks to moving things it's all manually carrying things while she was carrying his fish on her head in the back and climbing his hairs to carry things wearing a skirt that's covering your knees is really not comfortable to do all this manual physical work and most of all she had to say this uh fish in the black market we don't even have proper like chair to sit so sitting on that skirt on the floor you know it was very uncomfortable for her and this really eliminates women's ability to do more work this rule no pencil was a little bit going back and forth in the countryside there were times actually sometimes really rarely regime saying women can wear pants but i don't know where when they say no pants and suddenly everywhere on the street people like this the police almost like the fashion police standing there and making sure that women don't mirror pants however in pyongyang the captain this rule the no pence rule has been very consistent they really make sure the people the women in capital are women enough for the men so there was really no compromise for the women to wear pants in kavtar and women once wear skirt even this like freezing winter time number two no bicycle for women another thing the fact that women you know sitting on the chair and like doing this is not women enough and also it's a little bit they engage in something some kind of sexual way that like riding a bicycle for women and it's not perfectly fine for men so in pyongyang obviously very consistently saying no women cannot ride a bicycle however in the countryside the rules were going back and forth a little bit because you know in the countryside life's even a lot harder for women so they know like sometimes women have to do a lot of this manual label my sister was able to learn how to ride a bicycle but i wasn't because we didn't the time when i was able to learn we were so poor to even afford one bicycle and you know if you household has a bicycle in north korea like at least where i was in the middle class in the countryside it is almost equivalent owning a you know bmw or sedan that's how fancy the bicycle transportation is our family had a very briefly bicycle in our family and we couldn't afford it anymore so my sister only learned how to write it but like my mom also learned how to write it but then country says no women cannot and this is another way like men when they go to work if they have bicycle they can go really quickly and go back and forth but if a woman you cannot do it so it takes forever to go anywhere and commuting anywhere for a woman just so unnecessary pain for women because we nurse women somehow have to meet the standards of north korean men's eyes what is womanly enough what is the most modest thing women can do for them number three you can keep your name in north korea as a woman when you marry so this is a little irony right like when i came to the west they uh i was really shocked that like when women get married they a lot of times women choose the husband name and i follow the husband's name and i mean though but what i learned also was amazing you have a choice to keep your name and i also know a lot of like husband that i know they actually follow their wife's like family name that was so wonderful in north korea that you don't have to nobody actually copies their husband name but they the children when you have a children it must be following the father's name so my mom's first like your family name is beyond and my father's family name is park so that's why i'm miami park and like that the children must follow father's name and there's no option whatsoever so even though it seems like north korea is a bit more advanced that women don't have to follow husband's name but when it comes to children like in a way that is not your cinema it's your husband's even though women bear the children give birth to them number four if you are a woman in north korea and if you're picked by the group in pyongyang too for the pleasure squad you must go as i in one of the videos i talked about the pleasure squad in north korea where the regime goes looking for these pretty girls all around the country and picking them to pyongyang and capital make them into you know physicians uh like secretary and later becomes sexual slaves to kim's and high elite when you're picked by this group you have no choice you must go so being a pleasure squad being like sexier slave to the regime isn't your choice in north korea if you're women if you're selected by this group you must go number five women as a breadwinner this is like something that's so irony in my mind like there's a lot of patriarchy societies that i see in the like in the world that of course like they don't let women drive or like they are not letting women show their hair but a lot of times they like men still like able to provide and they expect men to be the main brother winner for the family but it's very opposite north korea they expect women to be the blood winner bring the bread to the table while doing all this nonsense stuff to women in in north korean regime like manliest go to work and if you're a doctor and medical doctor in north korea your salary is one dollar so even if you marry a medical doctor in north korea you cannot survive out of off the salary from your husband then what does women have to do because the husband have to go to work in the factory in the anywhere women have to go in the black market and find a way to survive and during that time women get raped by these officials because they are engaging in this black market illegal trading the guys who supposed to protect the women they are the ones who is raping women so why being women have to be the breadwinner there's so much sexual harassment and rape happening and women have no place to go and i like my aunt i remember she was working so hard at home raising her son and cleaning home cooking for her husband all of us doing stuff and going to black market making money and there's no place that appreciates her not even at home not even the society like women is almost like god is the most exploited subject in north korea right now number six domestic work is all for women it is another really shocking point to me is that a lot of times if like in the west i saw the women who were like breadwinners then at least the husband were like helping the women out at home they helped clean up clothes you know laundry cooking and cleaning taking your children on but in north korea even the men doesn't make a penny and all they are doing is going to factory and smoking and drinking and doing gambling women work so hard outside when they come home they must do everything and this most ridiculous thing is that north korean men most of them expect women to prepare them through like every meal like breakfast lunch and dinner north korean meal is not like simple like a lot of things are not like instant in the west you cannot just put a bread in the toaster and like you know greet it and put some eggs in the pan like that kind of cook quickly thing and also we don't have this gas or like anything so quick we have to chop the wood we have to start the fire we start like boil the water wash you know go somewhere in the lake to bring the fresh water cooking the you know grain and chopped like vegetable really making full full meal but imagine you do that three times a day and cleaning and children and then you have to make money outside to bring make that brain like grain and make the food come on this is so enormous pressure on women shorter today's north korea is exist because women are ordering this work number seven north korean women are sold like pigs in china i was talking about this like my or so personal human trafficking experience in china when in the 90s when north korea was going into economic hardship women the ones who had to start looking for the way to survive and feeding their children and husband they were the ones who pioneered of escape from north korea for the first time in search of food and protecting helping their family women chose to go to china and chose to be going to brother and being married to human traffickers and farmers and being raped and they are hoping this man who buys them would help their husband and children back in north korea in the late 90s most women went to china to do this because there was no way to find food in north korea and even to this day women who are the ones go escape and risk their life and go china and doing everything they could to help their family and they were so the ones who like myself go to even south korea america they do not like stop contacting their families most of the factors who have escaped safely and arriving freedom they stay in contact with their family members back in north korea and even after escape women when we come here it's not like we can start living our life again we still have to be responsible for the families we left behind they work so hard as you know like washer like disney washing and they as a waitress and even like taxi driver as a woman and they send you know save them money and give it to the through chinese broker and send it to north korean their family members left behind these were the seven most ridiculous things that women have to suffer in north korea and i think this is uh i really so grateful that i'm in the world where there is a word for feminism or even ladies first there was never such a time i heard like ladies first in north korea every time is men first on the dining table when we are all family gatherers we may not allow to start eating first even though we paid for the food we prepared for that meal we cannot lift our spoon until the father lifts their spoon and we cannot put it down the father puts it down and that is the still the everyday's life for north korean women most of them and i really hope that someday in this world all gender becomes equal and we get the equal opportunity and equal treatment thank you again for watching my video today and helping me to raise awareness about north koreans women's situation in north korea thank you guys and i look forward to seeing you next time
