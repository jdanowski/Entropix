anyway let's watch a north korean defector comparing ivy league campuses to living under the kim jong-un regime as we have covered on this program night after night far left ideologies they are infiltrating our educational system from grade school right through college it's getting that bad so bad that even those who have fled from totalitarian regimes seeking freedom in america in search of freedom of thought they're taking notice an actual defector from north korea yeah dude the worst thing the worst thing that kim jong-un ever did was issue trigger warnings before like talking about slavery attended the ivy league institution known as columbia university is speaking out telling foxnews.com the climate inside columbia reminds her of north korea citing themes like anti-western sentiment collective guilt suffocating political correctness for example during orientation she said she was scolded for saying that she enjoyed the works of acclaimed author jane austen and was told the books are racist along with being subjected to what she saw as nonstop anti-american propaganda here to tell her story is north korea defector yomi park along with fox news contributor i mean michael let's just get it out of the way get it out of the way she's hot okay just get it out of the way i don't want you to [ __ ] say it again for the rest of the yeah okay just one time okay done we're done we're no longer we're no longer saying that going forward okay i know you're gonna say it like now we're going to move on and now i'm going to dunk on her uh me i read this story you're you're saying so you grew up and how many years you were in north korea what 20 years and you think the indoctrination in the united states at our ivy league institution colombia is as bad or worse as the propaganda anti-american hate that you heard in north korea so when i was in north korea first thing that i learned was okay here's my hot take are you ready for this i think this person is secretly like a left book communist who always posts articles about how people are eating hamburgers in in north korea all the time okay why do i think this because this literally doesn't do what she thinks it does or doesn't do what fox news thinks it does which is to say that like which is to make people believe that like colombia is as horrible as like north korea all this does is make north korea look good okay that's it literally minimizes the experiences that people living under the brutal regime the brutal kim jong-un regime experience on a daily basis so she is a based dprk supporter secretly infiltrating the western media you underestimate the stupidity of the fox news audience i mean that's true but still that americans were bastards it was actually the one word at school when i was attending they told me actually there's just math problems saying there are four american bastards you killed two of them then how many american ambassadors left to care what the [ __ ] dude yo north korea is so i don't even know if this is real or not but i want it to be real that's [ __ ] hilarious dude she said she said we learned a math problem where there were four american bastards and we killed two how many american bass it's probably real no shot dude that's true by the way several other defectors have said that okay there is a robust economy for north korean defectors that literally i'm not saying that like existence in north korea is [ __ ] sweet okay it's not it is absolutely not but there is also a an entire economy that revolves around north korean defectors that like literally are just like north korea is a land where they they shoot you and murder you uh for for looking uh looking uh in the wrong direction like and uh they're constantly teaching children like americans are bastards which we are let's be real not gonna lie i thought she was talking about in glorious bastard for a second at school when i was attending they told me actually there's just math problems saying there are four american bastards you killed two of them then how many american ambassadors left to care and as a child in north korea you have to say two american masters and when i so they're all just lying for money what does that take wait you mean to tell me that this [ __ ] person is not literally grifting are you serious you mean to tell me to the person who is currently comparing conditions in north korean concentration camps to ivy league educations which is like such a convenient talking point for the fox news audience who wrote a book about her experiences is not grifting for money as a defector are you [ __ ] stupid you might as well you might as well literally be brainwashed like the left book uh psychos uh who who say that like everyone again who say that everyone in [ __ ] north korea eats burgers it's no different okay this person is literally a grifter there are a lot of defectors that do this uh you know props to them they escaped and uh now they want to make money and there is a massive audience of [ __ ] idiots that are like hell yeah brother in north korea they you're right brother they're just [ __ ] you know it's the worst place they all want to kill us they all want to murder us brother yeah [ __ ] yeah like we should glass north korea and uh this is all that this is is to just like give people that fuel to feel that way when in reality they have nothing like these people have nothing the most significant impact on the north korean citizens lives does not come from the authoritarian regime but instead the sanctions that are placed upon north korea and their over reliance on china to even have a [ __ ] international uh footprint okay now having said that are they incredibly authoritarian abso-fucking-lutely is kim jong-un horrible absolute [ __ ] lutely other concentration camps gulags prison labor apps of [ __ ] lutely okay i'm not denying that that would be really stupid to deny that are the living conditions awful are the living conditions in north korea awful absolute [ __ ] lutely to defectors routinely exaggerate in an effort to pander to western audiences to make more money to sell their books also true it doesn't take away from how [ __ ] horrible uh north korea is but uh don't be a sucker is what i'm saying don't be a sucker on the left side who says like oh i'm just a gang and uh north korea is actually [ __ ] sick and don't be a sucker uh as like a normal american who like eats this [ __ ] up and goes yo oh my god you're right i came to america a guy like i fell in love with this country this is such a wonderful country i never been accepted more than this country was and as at columbia university literally every professor was saying that you know the problems that we have on today's world is because of white men how they colonize africa they have koran's i mean asia right that's how they mess up everything and they are the one who's who needs to be blamed and i couldn't wait is she saying this is north korean education because if it is it's literally true so what the [ __ ] are they just like does north korea have a better education than we do here in the united states like what sitting in north korea's classroom or in america actually i couldn't believe why people were hating their own people that much what is your overall thought then when you think of look at america today and you compare it with your life experience which has been horrific uh sold into sex slavery at one point in your life uh you get to america you're expecting this to be the land of the free the home of the brave and the land of freedom and and you get the exact same propaganda here it's just heartbreaking i yeah is that what they're doing in colombia math problems around like murdering an american if you murder two americans out of four americans how many americans are left is that what they're teaching in colombia because that doesn't seem similar one is ridiculous the other is like just the truth about imperialism and colony and colonialism so i don't yeah yeah sex being sold into sex slavery learning about uh i don't know the slave trade in colombia who can say these things are different i can't because i wrote a book about it and also now i'm making money in the conservative circuit so same thing columbia university yes i know it's columbia university why did i say the country of colombia i i mean columbia university i know what you say in colombia made it sound like it no columbia university shut the [ __ ] up chat i literally sold as a sexual slave and i literally crossed the gobi desert to be free and now i thought i i landed in a country where i can say what i believed and have my you know freedom to think however now i end up in a country i have to constantly i love watching tankies debunk north korea as an authoritarian [ __ ] i mean it is literally an authoritarian [ __ ] if you were to say that north korea has greatly improved the material conditions uh of of its uh citizenry over the course of the past like two decades three decades then you're absolutely correct this country had like no [ __ ] electricity and nothing for the most part and they've been able to do that over the course of the past 30 years despite the fact that despite the fact that they have very little to work with but beyond that anyone that says that like anyone that says that you know north korea is a great place to live or that the country is not incredibly authoritarian to its own people then you know you're you're ridiculous censoring my speech not only that though the u.s killed a third of their people and leveled every single building above ground man i mean yes now in the name of a safe place colombia was told i mean told us what we cannot talk about yeah and north korea was better off than south korea after the korean war okay okay you're ridiculous it's like saying western germany was worse off than east germany after uh like you're you're like denying the marshall plan in its existence when you say [ __ ] like that that is literally a psychotic take okay because like when you get powered by the the uh the international uh capitalist countries when you get an insane amount of [ __ ] funds pumped into your your country you are always going to have a better uh a better circumstance than the other side like just recognize it for what it is instead of recognize it for what it is instead of uh uh like saying ridiculous [ __ ] i am so concerned like if america is not free i think there's no place else's life that is free and i think that's why it's really alarming to me listening uh governor oh you're talking about south korean fascist dictatorship but it doesn't matter because ultimately they were still getting [ __ ] funds funneled into south korea that's why south korea is where it's at currently and north korea is where it's at now if you compare south korea with under like a dictatorship to north korea that was leveled to the [ __ ] ground with like half of the people dead as a consequence of like endless bombing campaigns you're still stupid to miss park i'm you know sometimes when you when you're in the middle of what i call incrementalism step by step you know we now know what cancer culture is woke america is we now know what political political what's politically incorrect and then to hear this it's it it doesn't really shock me but hearing it still shocks me if that makes any sense well it makes a whole lot of sense i'll tell you what would make a lot of sense why don't you and i get her a tour bus and we'll pay for it sean you and me and we will send her to every college campus in america and let this remarkable young woman speak and tell her story and let people know that what they're giving up in this country they're giving away something that they can never get back and i'm so proud of her you have no idea how grateful i am for the courage and the clarity of yeonmi's story and i just want to tell her there are a lot of us who love america who still believe in freedom and we believe in you and we're grateful that you're here and your message is one that i hope every single american will hear i know some of them won't those people that you were taught to believe were the american bastards well they probably won't care but all of us are not like that we really aren't you should read some of mike's books about southern sayings remember alexander solzhenitsyn i remember the speech i think i believe if my memory serves me right he gave it at uh harvard any and you know here's a guy from former soviet union saying you're getting bad here too and here's what you're doing wrong would you consider this trip this bus trip that governor huckabee's talking about would you consider talking to college campuses although i've got to warn you you probably would be protested and they try to cancel you and shut you down because that happens as a conservative i can tell you every conservative i know lives through that experience would you consider that though so oh yeah i mean which is literally the same as living under kim jong-un's dictatorship okay like i'm sorry dude but you can't simultaneously maintain the position that like north korea is the worst place on earth with a brutal dictatorship while also comparing it to like you can't literally be like oh they're sending my family to the [ __ ] labor camp because i said kim jong-un has a fat [ __ ] and then turn around and be like if this is exactly the same as my college professor saying that uh you know slavery happened what the [ __ ] my used to be enemy was kim jong-un i mean i have been on the killing list of kim jong-un for many years because i speak spoke out in the west about the suffering of north korean people my three generations of family got punished but now it's ironically enough so many marxists and communists maoist leninists and sending me death threats and mao is there yeah the iowa maoist and this is such a irony that i don't even know how to respond that this is a war that against socialism and communism the fact that i come from north korea and saying you know north korea started as a communist country it began as you know let's make the most equal society in the world now the regime made 50 different classes based on your status based on what your great great grandfather did and when i went to colombia that's when i shocked they say because your ancestors owned the slaves that you must be guilty you are privileged because you are white and this is injustice because you can never choose your ancestors you don't choose your race yeah me getting death threats from conservatives is the exact same um to to being put in a [ __ ] labor camp in north korea i get death threats too i guess like now i know what it's like to be in a [ __ ] death camp dude or in a labor camp sorry i'm in new hampshire bro thanks for recognizing supporters of the great chairman mao xi is just a puppet for eternal chairman mao and people in north korea being punished for you know certain class and in this america the same thing happening right now wait face she's saying america is similar to north korea because of the the unequal class position and the inherent contradictions not being addressed amongst the the owner class and the working class [Music] you
