i think i like a bit more north korean dating type because they way more honest and they don't make me confused and they are very more forceful here you know losing everything means there you are so much you got your freedom you're not gonna be stuck to death but losing everything in north korea means you literally can lose your life in north korea you can never do those like online dating [Music] hi everyone i am back today in this video i am going to talk about dating in north korea and also comparing to dating in america luckily enough i was experienced tiny bit of dating ish in north korea and a little bit south korean in america obviously so you know i would love to compare them and share with you so you guys can understand north korea a bit deeper way so in dating in north korea has evolved like everywhere in the world but i don't think it's like a little big step for north koreans so let's begin with my parents generation who were born 50s 60s 70s during that time mostly it was arranged marriage but even it was like dating marriage they could never be able to know living together or getting to know each other they just like maybe exchange a few letters but that was it for my mom's case she was set up through her own brother and my father was a friend of my uncle so he told his parents and how about setting my friend and you know his sister together and one day my grandparents both sides met and they decided that date that's how they became married so before they got married they didn't really hold even hands not even mention kissing uh and i asked my mom's like so mom why did you marry father what about him did you attracted to and she literally said this oh i didn't hate him so that was enough reason to be to marry like here in order to marry someone like not hating that person but you you gotta be a good friend you have a good chemistry you guys have to be a soul mate you know picking a life partner is so so hard here then back in those times in north korea you know your standard was so low as long as you didn't like terrifyingly hate them it was more than enough to be bad with those person and then so let's talk about my time i was born at the end of 1993 so we call our generation as a black market generation that has experienced you know marketization and foreign information so we have been influenced by foreign movies so we watched and i watched pretty woman and dreamt of you know a gentleman and a lot of my friends are so south korean dramas they were romanticizing you know sweet south korean men so we were more a bit more idealistic when it comes to romance and i think we absolutely expected more from the other person but the thing is in our school i mean in my time it was very hard for a woman to initiate so we always had like waiting for boys or men to act first and also in our like tradition as a woman you have to be very more conservative and reserved so if the guy asks like hey i like you like do you wanna so in north korea when you say like i like you and that doesn't mean that means like you actually want them to be your girlfriend and that also means you want them to be your future wife there's no separating between dating material and marriage material whenever you meet a somebody you always link that person to your life partner so i was so shocked when i came to the west they say oh like just she's afraid of dating and like what do you mean and like oh we just we kiss we do a lot of things but we are not really girlfriends and boyfriends what are you talking about in north korea there's no such a thing there's no such a thing like i mean hooking up was so i never heard that like i never heard the one night stand so if the guy even that you like the guy he asked ask me like like wanna go out and ask me to be his girlfriend as a manner i had to say no like for at least three times so ask so guys have to keep going ask and ask and i think i like a bit more north korean dating type because they way more honest and they don't make me confused and they are very more forceful and there's always pros and cons but in in north korean context they are way more pursuing the relationship in men's side than women most of the time and women always have to be in a position where like we reserved but the problem is that when women actually really really don't like the guy so we say no no thank you i'm not interested but the guys think like we're doing it to be polite and being a good proper woman so they keep trying and trying and even like women get horrified by they keep drying so sometimes like guys can be physical so they keep asking women and they're like no no no then actually sometimes like literally big women as like like if you don't become my woman i'm gonna kill you and like we don't have a place to call or talk to police you know there's no way like if you can get help so a lot of women actually i know be married to those men out of those kind of physical threats so as i said guys there's a pros and cons there right that's not the most romantic side and the other one when you try to break up in north korea if the guys were not absolutely there and the women go like i want to break up with you if the guys really don't like the idea they can just like beat you up so breaking up is like a bit dangerous for women when they do it but when guys like i want to break up with you usually like women what can we do we cannot like beat him off so it is a little bit more risky for women to get a north korean man and there's a higher higher chance to be you know bitten by your man but you know again like another pros and cons north korean men in general they are way more responsible they take their relationship way way more seriously than men here i think the thing i don't like about dating here is people think about dating such a light way and they're more like interested in having fun oh like she's fun i'm gonna have fun with you i just want to have fun you know but i'm from coming from north korea where i always view the relationship is the most important thing family value is like number one priority in my life so if i see someone that i started develop feeling towards the person of course i want them to be my like husband and my life partner for the rest of my life but for americans to take there from there to here takes years you guys started hanging around taking the time to define who you are like boyfriends and girlfriends taking another few years to be engaged and then you live together and then all a year to get married it takes like forever to go there and like me someone who is just not used to it i just couldn't handle the american dating culture here i'm sure someday i will get used to it but still not i'm like struggling meet you know like you're dating for just dating say again you gotta find some other way to find someone to marry another thing is like uh when people date these days in north korea in here you know you like literally fall in love with everyone right there's doesn't matter your ethnicity or your language or your race and like nothing matters or even status economic status in the society but in north korea your family's status really matters the most even if you love a person so so much your family status doesn't match that will affect your future forever so the only thing tricky thing about north korea's hungering status is that there is only way to go down it's extremely hard to go up so let's say i was like low cast because my father was a prisoner so and my relatives some of them have been to chairs so i was in a low status and then if i meet a guy who was really having high status i don't come with his status goal he comes to mind so it was like almost so many romeo and juliets in north korea and the young people they know their love cannot be achieved in north korea because of their different family status a lot of times they even commit suicide together because they cannot fulfill their love together it's really so sad like we heard i mean when i was in north korea we hear these things you know this neon culprit they love this year so much but the family was really you know hating it and against it so they eventually commit suicide to prove their love to [Music] to each other and it was like for what say like what even family status means in this 21st century like in my case my first crush was you know he was in a very higher status than my family and the girls who knew him told him about like my father's that you know prison history and how lost us we were and he didn't get deterred by that he's not like oh i'm still gonna marry you it doesn't matter love is all enough for me and that i think time was the only stream of light that i saw in north korea there was someone that selfless existed like here you know losing everything means there you are so much you got your freedom you're not gonna be stuck to death but losing everything in north korea means you literally can lose your life so in even that extreme situation i still found somebody that's that selfless in the face of you know love and true love and i still think of him because how what incredible person he was and you know even in most harsh like evil and distrusting like oppressed country like north korea there are tons of good people like that who are so willing and such a huge heart i mean now i like you know i have so many girlfriends who are trying out dating and in america guys like you do a lot of online dating but no no not in north korea we can't of course we don't have internet so not to mention like online dating right this is like i never done online dating so i don't know how actually it really works i just see from our friends i looked at tinder and she told me like you know swipe this way swipe that way but in north korea you can never do those like online dating so usually you're like people you can meet is very limited and usually it's from your own town so you know you can like meet people in the you know train you can meet people in very random places and i think there's some kind of kind of romanticism to that though you know you never know where you're going to find love it's not as efficient as dating online dating here like like you tell their height the race and income level education level all of things you are like selected by algorithms but in north korea in a way you are way more open-minded to who you can meet or even where you can meet so you know you i think yeah i think whenever i hear from lobsters from my people in north korea it's way more like you know interesting and surprising than people meeting here it's like oh just i wanna i know like coffee meets baker we just grab a tea and then something dinner like that lastly like how north koreans date each other so here you guys go for drink or dinner movies right but in north korea we we don't really have those like fancy movie theaters you know you don't even have 24 hours electricity so usually where we go dave is like really sweet like we go to like riverside or we go to the you know train track not many trains passing by train track or we it's very not a good thing to show to neighbors that you are dating someone so we really have to hide so we like you know we don't really go hold hands and dating around we have to find a place when it's dark secretly seeing each other get a quick glimpse of each other and you know we still do a lot of writing letters physical like letters so you know i do i think there's different pros and cons but i don't miss those kinds of simplicity and purity in a relationship sometimes anyway it was so much fun to share dating culture in north korea guys and i look forward to seeing you all next time thank you bye bye
