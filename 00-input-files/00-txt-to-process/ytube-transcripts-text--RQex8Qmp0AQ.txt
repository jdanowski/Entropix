in this video we will be discussing the g7 summit the covet 19 crisis vaccinations kim jong-un losing weight not being able to know if he can feed his country two years from now three years from now north korea is going through a food crisis on top of the global food crisis i'm sure if you've been to the grocery store you see there is a lot of items that can't seem to stay in stock or they can't get any more of until further notice even at shipping docks there's delays so because of the sanctions north korea is filling it first so i'm sure you've heard about the g7 summit the g7 summit is a summit where some world leaders i say some because china does not show up india does not show up so this is why i believe the g7 summit is useless but it's a summit where world powers get together they they don't just discuss world issues like climate change i do not believe in climate change but for some my reason these uh world leaders keep pushing climate change they all agree on climate change but at the g7 summit they come up with ideas what they think that could solve climate change women's rights yes at the g7 summit world leaders which happen to be men discuss women's rights this lets you know that women don't run anything whatever rights women have they got it from men world leaders discussing women rights and what they think should be done about it the strategies they are going to take are taking or should take could take on women's rights now joe biden and vladimir putin seemed to be cordial with each other you didn't see them arguing i mean world leaders don't argue anyway but when you look at the history between vladimir putin and joe biden with joe biden son hunter biden crimea the accusations of russia meddling in american presidential elections so you would think that there's some tension there's not but let donald trump go to the g7 summit and him and putin is cordial with each other could you imagine the headlines here in america about donald trump and russia is in cahoots with each other about america but like i said it was never donald trump it was joel biden it was joe biden the entire time it was also said that putin and joe biden discussed cyber attacks they did not come to an agreement with cyber attacks they talked about human rights violations both countries are accusing each other of human rights violations russia position on this is america you have a lot of nerve you're calling the kettle black you should not be telling anyone any country anything about human rights violations now russia does have a point on that there but just because oh yeah there was a fake article written i guess they took it down it was about the g7 summit and it said that joe biden and vladimir putin agreed that iran should not have a nuclear weapon i heard that and i said what i tried to look for that story i cannot find that story so you knew that that was a false story the lame street media tried to push but for some odd reason it's okay for joe biden to be cordial with vladimir putin but not donald trump and donald trump did come out and call it out see because donald trump did not lay down on this chronovirus is the reason why he's not president had donald trump fall in line with dr fausti donald trump would still be president today joe biden has a lot of interest in that region crimea the black sea they want crimea to be with nato vladimir putin does not want that he's like hell no i'm not going to be surrounded by nato turkey is nato also however turkey is unpredictable that's why russia has a majority of their military personnel on the eastern end of russia because of the threat of unpredictable turkey but if you don't have all nations there like china you don't have any african nations at the g7 summit this g7 summit is for a select few the fact that russia is in that select few with america that should let you know so but russia is supposed to be a foe of america russia is allies with iran and north korea now there's a potential new iran nuclear deal that's supposed to happen and if it does happen that would ease sanctions on iran and iran would be able to get a surplus of millions of dollars which in return they can use that money to purchase more equipment more uranium for their military that is something they are going to do they know war with israel and america is inevitable they know this and if this is barack hussein obama's third term then there's going to be a nuclear deal and it doesn't matter what happens with the nuclear deal everyone is going to not like it they're going to hate it the only the only country that will benefit from a new iran nuclear deal is iran why because they will be able to get sanctions eased and they will in return get millions of dollars i think uh barack obama obama gave uh iran four million american dollars which they can in return flip quadruple whatever it might have been more than that it might have been more than four million but if donald trump went to the g7 summit and he was cordial with vladimir putin and they talked about climate change um i don't remember donald trump's stance on climate change um but regardless he goes to the g7 summit he discussed climate change whether he believes in it or not he just rolls with the show whatever photo op they come up with a strategy that's it it doesn't mean i i i believe the g7 summit is useless it's just another summit for world leaders to fill each other out and blame each other for world problems good thing china did not go because there's so much information coming out about china in the wuhan lab with this covet 19. so good thing china did not go but even if they did joe biden would not pose a threat to china anyway so it you know it really doesn't matter and his son has special interests in china and crimea hunter biden he has the key to do whatever he wants to do globally and not go to jail what a life what a life now to kim jong-un because donald trump met with kim jong-un when donald trump was in office kim jong-un did talk his but it was more jab taking because america would make in fun or should i say donald trump would make it fun of north korea's failed rocket launches right so kim jong-un would fire back but overall there were no food shortages crisis even with cargo ships you have a record number of cargo ships catching on fire in the middle of the pacific the gulf the atlantic causing major pollution problems on top of the covet 19 lockdown so you have countries that have been sanctioned by america that's starting to feel the pressure starting to feel the pressure and north korea is that country and kim jong-un wants to talk to joe biden about easing those sanctions or its war either or and it looks like it's going to be war america is not going to ease sanctions on north korea and people better get ready for it because we have a shortage of a lot of things in the grocery stores i know you have noticed it i want to try to get chicken wings they didn't have any more chicken wings you know it's bad when they're all out of chicken wings there's an ammunition shortage the trade war between america china australia is being filled globally now and kim jong-un is losing a lot of weight i don't know if it's because of the food issues in north korea or it's because he wants to get in shape lose weight i don't know but this country will run out of food in a short period of time and unless these sanctions are eased on top of the because you have to understand something north korea did not have any covet cases maybe a few if that there were a few news articles that said that covet 19 has hit north korea hard but that came out to be false kim jong-un did a great job one of the best jobs globally keeping kovi 19 out of north korea but because of the sanctions and the slow up of goods globally import export his country and countries like his are filling the effects even america is filling the effects again there's things that we can't get that we used to be able to get just last year at the grocery store this is why i tell people stock up get used to eating salads they're healthy for you anyway because that's what's only going to be left at a lot of these grocery stores salad bologna better get creative with salad making better start making turkey salads with avocado bake you some garlic bread to go with it because there's going to be major food shortages if america is seeing a shortage you know damn well north korea is seeing a shortage which is why kim jong-un came out to say hey we're gonna have to talk about these sanctions or we're going to war you're not going to starve my people out because i refuse to play ball with you son of a now i don't know the reason why kim jong-un lost weight no one really knows their speculations is because of the food shortage in north korea then it could be because he wants to get into shape who knows um you know but when you look at what's going on globally um this globe is in trouble big big trouble had you left donald trump in office we may not be here i'm not saying we won't but i am saying we may not be in this situation donald trump had china in check donald trump had china in check putin had a level of respect for donald trump not joe biden so again this is a waiting game we don't know what's going to happen we'll have to wait and see i'm out
