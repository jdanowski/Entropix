no dictator no regime and no nation should underestimate ever American resolve the United States who is the ringleader of the division of our people and the crime of structure to the reunification should stop anti North Korea sanctions for all of the tension all of the intense rhetoric and provocative actions they won't be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen Rocket Man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime whatever Trump expected he will see a response above that we will control the mentally deranged u.s. dotard with fire the standoff between nuclear North Korea and the rest of the world there is one place where the US and North Korea see eye-to-eye or at least face-to-face the Demilitarized Zone the DMZ marking the border between North and South Korea and the armistice agreement struck to pause the Korean War I think there's we always operate at a high level higher level attention and say the rest of the peninsula and just because it is a pretty strategically important area and so based on what's going on outside of our area of operations nothing really changes for us we're always ready to you know follow the the commander's intent of what the chain of command above us asked us to do everyone wants to avoid the worst possible scenario and so even the propaganda I would say has been pretty minimal and it hasn't been overly tense just a few feet from here is North Korea this is the DMZ the demilitarized zone on this side the South Koreans the US control just a few feet from here the North Koreans it was a lot of communication between the two for many years in fact they had a phone they'd pick up and they'd answer on the North Korean side but they stopped answering in 2013 now South Korean troops come out every day they stand here on point and if there's a message to deliver they go right to that line that concrete barrier that is the line with North Korea tows to that concrete and they yell the message to the North Koreans at which point they're videotaped that's the only communication back and forth from that building we have a hotline and kind of see the wire dropped across to North Korea it's a ring down phone it works and you know we test it four times a day so basically you pick it up it rings there yes sir they're just not answering it right now we nicknamed it the Batphone because the State Department was up here one time and I was talking to one of their delegation and I just said that phone like that so she went back to Washington DC and sent us the Batman sticker so the Batphone it's a matter of fact we're gonna do the midday check right now now no answer no answer this time I was kind of hoping they would answer for you although my mom would never let me when they don't answer it we have to come down here on the border here as captain will saying we put toes on the border there and we shout the messages at them more times than not go come down and video record the message that they're not getting by just answering the phone so make sense to somebody in North Korea it's kind of a strange process it is yes sir some of the stuff after six and a half decades we've reduced it to a very elementary level and that's just to sustain this place as a place that is open for communication and dialogue however they haven't been general officer talks up here since 2009 there haven't been actual staff officer level talks since 2013 in front of you you see the borders represented by these white stakes it's called the MDL or military demarcation line and you'll notice there's no fences on the border there are no fences on this de facto border across the entire Peninsula the only fences are on the southern boundary and northern boundary of the dmz which we pass through of course coming up here so really this is quite an open areas nothing keeping nothing physically keeping walking but if you did you probably shot it's estimated there are still some two million landmines along the border on the North Korean side and US commanders say some 70% of the North's military is positioned along its southern border along the DMZ as we look out over here I mean 180 degrees this is all North Korea absolutely the way that we're located right now we're essentially surrounded on three sides by North Korea so is the whole JSA the joint security area and juts out kind of like a finger into North Korea and so we're on they're pretty strict observation at all times yeah he hasn't stopped looking at us I don't think he will see what's the music for here that's North Korean propaganda coming from the propaganda village at Giza though which is you may have seen the big flag pole as we headed up there phew so what is it a song that we're supposed to like North Korea and we're here absolutely yeah the oddly enough they both had propaganda broadcasts from either side and it stopped in 2004 but in 2015 there was a provocative landmine incident up here and it blew off - the first rock infantry to vote and Infantry Division soldiers legs and ever since then both sides have been pumping the propaganda again and it can be lovely music like this or it can be the you know speeches you know and North Korea plays at about 20 hours a day 20 hours a day on our side we do about two or three hours a day and it could be anything from news broadcast to kpop I stepped out one time and they were playing Radio Free America so I stepped out to Bon Jovi Fox News Alert [Music] the sound you hear well that's South Korean music propaganda essentially being blasted back into North Korea North Korea right over my shoulder the mountains in the distance it's estimated that North Korea has about 1500 artillery pieces positioned in those mountains hidden if the US were to attack North Korea in just seconds those artillery pieces would be rolled out and they'd fire their target 25 miles this way Seoul [Music] video of North Korean artillery tests tells the story those 1500 artillery pieces aimed at Seoul are the main considerations and limitations to even small targeted US military action in North Korea which brings us back to the time-honored tension in the DMZ the arcane maneuvers the spectacle of both sides bringing tour groups to stare at the opposing country like some there's just a commercial tour it is very likely made up of I can see some Westerners there can also see some Asian folks a lot of Chinese visitors they will often have North Koreans come a lot of times their party officials and party members even American visitors not associated with the government in the military prior to September 1st travel ban American visitors would go there in fact my counterpart over there is called major moon and the kid speaks better English than I do yeah I think he had an American teacher and the blue buildings built to straddle the border for negotiations that haven't been used for that purpose in more than four years in February of 2013 or created a third nuclear test and there was a whole bunch of sanctions laid on them and so sort of in protest of the sanctions yeah really they just you know they were very verbose about ripping up the armistice and all the agreements that came after the armistice when was the last time the North Koreans were in here for this meeting it was May of 2009 however the North Koreans are in here every day five or six days a week with tours so much like we have in here right now we lock the north side door and we'll bring visitors into this area so then if they come down they lock the south side door and then it's their deal that's it yes sir so technically the line right here is is right at this table that's it yes sir and it'll you know you followed out the windows you see that concrete block that you were showing that you were mentioning outside and that is divided the joint security area since right around 1976 I really believe that it makes sense for North Korea to come to the table and to make a deal that's good for the people of North Korea and the people of the world the threat from North Korea obviously hangs over president Trump's entire trip to Asia so standing in North Korea we'll be right back with special report after the break
