the remarkable story of a young woman's escape from north korea in order to protect me i saw my mother raped defectors shared new details of the regime's brutality you can't even imagine it the north korean regime denied this kim jong-un is a murderer the dictatorship is so incensed by what she's saying that they want her track down pyongyang fired back with angry rhetoric outright calling her a liar korea will strike a lethal blow saying the wrong thing could execute me regurgitate the regime's propaganda kim jong-un is the embodiment of our destiny it becomes impossible to determine what's real and what's staged only people who escape can give us the truth i escaped when i was 13 years old the fact that she survived it's nothing short of a miracle one to two million people died with dead bodies filling the streets one of the worst human rights crises of our time it only took three generations violating every conceivable human right deliberate use of starvation as a means of control i didn't know what freedom was i escaped for about advice how did you escape when you were just 13 years old growing up in north korea my father was sent to labor camp for engaging in illegal trading he was selling clocks sugar rice and later copper to feed us the gum just arrest them torture them and send them prison and he went to labor camp for 10 years we are starving but i cut the lights from china at night and i wondered if i got where the light is i might be able to find a bottle of rice so it was the only option for us my mother and i found a lady who told us they can send us to china and we climb the mountain we cross the frozen river we cannot just cross anywhere because the border guy is watching us and they will shoot us we bribe the border guards but we cannot grab every guard because 100 meters guards guards cars and the dogs like barking so somebody who would shoot us from there i thought i was gonna be shocked it was very scary and we luckily we didn't get shot we made it to china when i escaped to china we found out that we had to be sold to live in china you were sold to a man and you really resisted giving in to him for a long time physically fighting yeah in order to survive yeah that was the last moment i remember i was being a kid and i had to be a dart my mother was being sold for 65 dollars i was sorted for over 200 dollars i was more expensive than her because i was virgin and i was young because i was 13. and the man who bought me he was broker but he told me if i become his mistress you do by my mom by my father and i thought if i sacrificed myself i can see my family again and that's how i became mistress my father was around 45 years old he'd been tortured so much in prison camp in north korea in china we could not go to hospital to treat him so he had to just die now thinking that i never realized how young he was until he was dying he told me that you have to one thing promise me that you are never going to kill yourself because he told me life is a gift that i should never give up my father died and i had to bury his ashes in the middle of my mountain and i was 14 years old at that time in 2009 my mother and i were raspied by christian missionaries who led us to mongolian border with china and then we walked and crossed the gabi desert the moment i stood on the desert sun just right it's endless endless and i felt only the stars were with me it was 2009 and it was end of february or beginning of march so it was freezing cold so we were crossing the wire fences and we were crawling and walking and running and we followed the compass and then later we connect with compass so we follow the stars north and i was so so thankful because i met somebody in the desert thank you thank you i was speaking chinese they say and then we flew to south korea the very first day when i got out from the resettlement center the happiest thing was having food and i remember how my father tortured and my father died without knowing even this kind of democracy exists in the world he didn't even know this much food was available in the world now i live in the united states as a free person thank you [Music] i'm at columbia university right now i'm only 24 years old i am married to american i have a 6 month old son along my journey i have seen the horrors that human can inflict on another but i've also witnessed active tenderness and kindness and sacrifice in the worst imaginary circumstances i know that it is possible to lose part of your humanity in order to survive but i also know that the sparkle of human dignity is never completely extinguished and that given the oxygen of freedom and the power of love it can grow again be free from my experience literally everything is possible now i'm here and that is why i believe in miraculous nothing is forever in this world and i say we have every reason to be hopeful [Music] you
