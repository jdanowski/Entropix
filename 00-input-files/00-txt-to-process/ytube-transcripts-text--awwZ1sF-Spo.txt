normal means they face harsh punishments even death it's hard to gauge whether the cheering and public adoration they show for their leader is genuine or forced upon them now a lot of what we think we

the world standing at 1080 feet its pyramid-shaped design dominates the skyline however despite boasting 105 floors it's never welcomed a single guest the hotel was the product of the cold war rivalry between north and south korea in 1986 a south korean company built the west in stamford in singapore at the time the tallest hotel in the world in response north korea planned to steal their record by building an ever higher hotel construction on the state-of-the-art hotel began in 1987 it was designed to house at least 3 000 rooms as well as five revolving restaurants with panoramic views it was scheduled to open in 1992 in time for the 80th birthday of president kim il-sung by 1992 the building had reached its full architectural height but due to engineering problems and the economic crisis in north korea following the collapse of the soviet union construction stopped and the half-finished building that cost an estimated 75 million dollars was abandoned ironically had it reopened on time it would have surpassed the west in stamford to become the world's tallest hotel and would have been the seventh tallest building in the world for over a decade the skeleton of the concrete structure loomed large over the city at the top there was a rusting crane serving as an eerie reminder of the broken dream rumors started circulating that the building was shortly built and that the alignment of its elevator shafts were crooked and it soon got dubbed the worst building in the world with the names such as the hotel of doom and phantom hotel to the north korean government the building became an embarrassment and the hotel's vision they once proudly displayed on postage stamps was now edited out of official photographs and emitted from printed maps then in 2008 after a 16-year pause construction unexpectedly resumed as part of a deal with orozcom an egyptian conglomerate that was contracted to build north korea's 3g network the rusty old crane that blotted the landscape for nearly two decades was finally removed and the structure was reinforced with metal panels the building was completely glazed over with windows giving it a modern sleek appearance the project was completed in 2011 and it was speculated the hotel's opening was imminent although photographs of the hotel's interior revealed that inside very little work had been done german luxury hotel group kempinski announced that the hotel would partially open under its management in mid-2013 but just a few months later they pulled out saying entering the north korean market was not currently possible again rumors persisted that the building was unsound and this was compounded when in 2014 a 23-story apartment building in the city collapsed killing an unknown number of people the hotel was abandoned again for the next five years before coming back to life in 2018 when leds were installed on its facade turning the building into the city's biggest light show as well as a propaganda machine a four-minute program showing north korea's history and a variety of political slogans was displayed on the building but the question still remains will this huge building ever open its doors what is its purpose seeing as north korea does not welcome tourists they even arrested and locked up an australian student who was studying in the country just for taking a photo of the new signage accusing him of committing spying acts against the state the mysterious double death of kim il-sung bitter enemies north and south korea are separated by the korean demilitarized zone or dmz for short a strip of land running across the korean peninsula that serves as a buffer zone between the two countries between 1953 and 2004 both sides broadcast audio propaganda across the dmz through massive loudspeakers they erected however in 2004 the north and south agreed to end the broadcasts although some broadcasts have resumed had certain high tension times over the years on november 15 1986 a short story appeared in a south korean newspaper reporting rumors from japan that the north korean leader kim il-sung was dead as these rumors were a common occurrence no one took much notice however the next day at midday the south koreans heard sad music emanating from north korean amplifiers only music not a single word soon after they started to read kim il-sung's biography through the megaphones and began to broadcast a message hailing the great leader then at 8pm that evening the north koreans finally came out with the shocking revelation kim il-sung had been shot and was dead and his son kim jong-il had inherited power and he was immediately named president and marshall by 10 45 that same evening the north korean flag hoisted near the dmz had been lowered as a sign of mourning the next day south korea was in total confusion and panic the implications of a new leader in north korea could be dire and police and soldiers were put on high alert the situation was further amplified when the north koreans began taunting the south korean government saying the world has a good view of south korea south korean president chun assembled an emergency meeting of the cabinet and among the documents shown to the ministers was a message from an american general who was in command of the us army in korea claiming that kim il-sung died in a car accident and was not murdered the cabinet realized that something was going on but no one could fathom out what it was the situation was very serious and the government thought there was a reasonable chance of an imminent north korean invasion although bizarrely there was still no official proof of kim il-sung's death and wild rumors began to circulate meanwhile messages were still being broadcast across dmz about the leader's demise although some of them were contradictory at 25 past one this was announced respected comrade kim jong-il is the eternal leader of our nation then two hours later under the respected comrade kim jong-il even greater happiness awaits us then at six o'clock ocean you and the third man in the country as reader's reminder took power the north korean people actively support him then at 8 45 don't believe the groundless rumors about the demise of our leader kim il-sung then at four minutes past 10 after sad music the big star of our nation has fallen then at 1206 the words read kim il-sung resigned and transferred power to the party's leadership on the northern side of the dmz all households were hanging pieces of black clothing from their eaves in a sign of mourning then on november 18th at 10 in the morning kim il-sung alive and well appeared in person at a nearby airport to meet a mongolian delegation on the same day messages about him being dead stopped without any explanation no mention of the incident was ever talked about again kim il-sung went on to rule north korea until his death in 1994. nearly 35 years have passed since and no one knows what really happened over those days in 1986 was it a mistake maybe there was some misreporting this seems unlikely due to the dmz announcements or was it a personal initiation of one of the propaganda nests on the dmz or was it a failed coup if so the conspirators would be long dead almost certainly executed the only other explanation is that kim il-sung personally decided to check how the world and especially south korea would react to his death but it seems that it might have backfired as it was a bit like crying wolf nobody really believed it had happened and were waiting for the official confirmation which never came north korean ghost ships for many years boats have been washing up on the western shores of japan many of them are either empty or contain the bodies or skeletal remains of men the boats are often old rickety very simple vessels with no modern engines or navigation instruments on board because the boats were washed up empty or with only dead bodies it wasn't initially clear where they had come from but some observers theorized that they were north korean fishing boats searching for king crab squid and sandfish and they were soon dubbed the north korean ghost ships markings on some of the korean vessels did indicate that they belong to the north's military which is heavily involved in the fishing industry it's normal practice that when a boat with corpses washes ashore officials tried to investigate the cause of death but as the korean bodies tended to be in an advanced state of decomposition it was impossible to determine that but it was speculated that these poorly equipped boats either blew off course or got lost during the winter months and the crew either died of starvation or exposure but nothing conclusive was determined and sadly no one looked for the men however in 2017 several ships washed ashore with the crew still alive they all claimed they were fishermen from north korea who had gotten into trouble at sea it was initially thought they were defectors trying to escape the north korean regime but remarkably all crews found alive have asked to be sent back to north korea so why would fishermen take such a huge risk while it could be because international sanctions are tightening due to pyongyang's nuclear and missile tests meaning the regime is under pressure to boost agriculture and food supplies so with the north korean leadership demanding bigger catches sailors are being forced to take risks to meet those targets this coupled with the fact that north korea sold the fishing rights in some of its territorial waters of china last year means there is a small area for local fishermen to fish in hence they might be having to venture further out to sea of course there are others who believe these men who are taking huge risks could be spies however like most things in north korea we will probably never find out the real reason so many are prepared to go out into dangerous water in an unequipped boat knowing that if they did get into trouble or go missing no one from their home country would care enough to look for them and so the mystery rolls on magumi yukata on the 15th of november 1977 13 year old magumi yokota left her badminton practice in agata japan and started the seven minute walk to her home but she never made it her mother began to panic ringing around to check if anyone had seen her daughter but no one heard soon police and tracker dogs were out in the darkness searching for magumi they scoured the beach and pine forest near her home but found nothing out of sea speeding towards the korean peninsula was a boat manned by north korean agents locked in the hold was a terrified magumi in the year that followed police searched endlessly and a kidnapping unit was set up at the yokota house but the investigation drew an agonizing blank nearly 20 years later in 1993 a north korean spy who defected to the south told in detail about an abducted japanese woman who matched magumi's description her abduction was an unplanned blunder at the time magumi was walking home two agents were finishing up a spy mission in negata and were waiting on the beach for a pickup boat but they realized they had been spotted by magumi and fearing she might identify them they abducted her at the time they didn't realize magumi was just a child when they arrived back in north korea they were in trouble for taking the school girl magumi cried for her mother and refused to eat unnerving her stateminders so to soothe her they promised that if she worked hard and learned fluent korean she would be allowed to go home of course that was a lie and instead they forced megumi to work as a spy trainer teaching japanese language and behavior at an elite school for espionage magumi wasn't the only young person abducted for such activities by north korea but she was the youngest north korea later admitted to kidnapping 13 japanese citizens for the first two decades after magumi disappeared the yakotas had nothing but a cold case and their own desperate need to understand what had happened then in 1997 pyongyang finally agreed to investigate and announced they had information that megumi was still alive and living in north korea so for her family the question was how do we get her back the okatas went public with their kidnap story and appeared on primetime tv and questions were raised in parliament and the government publicly confirmed that magumi was not an isolated case they got a breakthrough when it was revealed that in 1986 magumi had married a south korean national likely also abducted and the couple had a daughter in 1987. but later her husband claimed that magumi hanged herself in a pine forest on the 13th of april 1994 on the grounds of a pyeong mental hospital where she was being treated for depression although her family and many others believe he was speaking under duress and was just reading from a prepared script when he made these claims in another twist two years after declaring magumi dead north korean officials handed over to her parents what is said were her ashes they arrived in 2004 on the 27th anniversary of her kidnapping her parents had kept their daughter's umbilical cord when she was born a japanese tradition and dna tests were performed the samples did not match it is widely believed especially in japan that megumi is still alive but in november 2011 a south korean magazine stated that a 2005 directory of pyongyang residents listed a woman named kim ong gong with the same birth date as magumi who was living with her husband kim yong nam sources later claimed that kim gong was actually magumi's 24 year old daughter and in march 2014 magumi's parents were allowed to meet their granddaughter for the first time in mongolia along with her own baby daughter their great-grandchild in recent years five of the 13 japanese citizens abducted back in the 1970s have been reunited with their families but the fate of magumi is still unknown her father died not knowing whether his daughter was alive or dead but her aging mother and brothers still live in hope of finding her one day is kim jong-un still alive in 2020 there was a frenzy of articles claiming kim jong-un was gravely ill normally reliable sources reported he was in grave danger possibly as a result of a botched operation others claimed he was in a coma or brain dead the reports seem to have originated from daily nk a south korean website which monitors news gossip and rumors from north korea it stated on april 20th 2020 that kim was recovering from unspecified heart surgery to resolve a condition caused by his heavy smoking obesity and fatigue and that he was in a stable condition it was noted by other news outlets that he hadn't been seen in public since april 11th and more significantly he had failed to show up for the annual ceremony on april 15th marking the day of the sun the anniversary of the birthday of kim il-sung and kim's grandfather it wasn't long before western news outlets such as cnn reported that the united states was monitoring intelligence that kim was in grave danger after surgery the story cited several unnamed sources who insisted kim's health scare was credible but the severity was hard to assess soon after the story exploded around the world with various theories including he had died of covid or that his guard had shot him on twitter kim jong dead was trending focus soon turned to who his successor would be with his sister kim yo-jong in line to succeed him amongst the murk and speculation donald trump the then president of the united states waded in saying i have a good relationship with king john and i hope he's okay a few days later trump said he had a very good idea about kim's health but that he couldn't talk about it the world was confused and many believe the reports about kim's health must be true and so the world waited to learn if a rogue unpredictable nuclear-armed state still had its hereditary leader or whether it might be plunged into a power struggle then as if laughing at the rest of the world kim jong-un appeared in a slate-issued photo in which he was shown cutting the ribbon on a new fertilizer factory outside pyongyang looking very much alive this development was a bit awkward for cnn and many other news outlets around the world as well as a few intelligence agencies which had spent the past few weeks in a frenzy over kim's health providing yet again that nothing about north korea more specifically kim jong-un can be trusted it also throws doubt on the so-called intelligence and how much we truly know about north korea in light of kim's reappearance there are now rumors that he uses a body double and so could still be dead or gravely ill but like everything in north korea i guess we'll never know so that's it for this video and remember if you haven't already heard we have a new channel solely dedicated to astronomy if you have an
