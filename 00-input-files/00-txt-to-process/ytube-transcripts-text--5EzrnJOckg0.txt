[Music] when seen through the lens of north korean propaganda he looks like the happy winner of a best job in the world contest [Music] each time he's out in public he has the heir of a man marveling in the discovery of a fabulous country that his parents built just for him a country where he has a hand in just about everything drawing up plans for a new quarter of pyongyang being a lifeguard for the youth of north korea [Music] sampling the biscuits which will soon flood the regime's groceries overseeing the growth of the chicks on the state farms and even acting as an advisor to the country's hair salons arduous days but days where he can still find the time to try out the latest rides at the capitol's amusement park these absurd amusing but also terrifying images are the only ones we have to help us understand this young man who is at the controls of a nuclear power [Music] kim jong-un does not give interviews so we have decided to go and meet those who know him best in an attempt to draw a clear portrait of him [Music] our journey begins in the heart of the swiss alps in bayern the capital of the swiss confederation this is the home of one of the biggest north korean communities abroad [Music] it's a discreet community whose activities have nonetheless attracted the attention of a member of a consortium of investigative journalists there is a historical explanation switzerland is a neutral country a member of the united nations in geneva and other international bodies and north koreans have always had access to switzerland with its peaceful side and its respect for privacy [Music] many famous people have sent their children to be educated here in switzerland these are probably the reasons that compelled kim jong-il to send his children to switzerland study of swiss foreign documents reveals the existence of a mr pak for whom in 1992 the north korean embassy in switzerland requested a visa and a posting to bern the visa request bore the names of three children chol hoon and me yang the names were only slightly altered and the birthdays were identical mr pak's children were in fact those of the north korean dictator kim jong-il we knew the children were here we knew their real identities but it was not a problem for the swiss authorities it was even seen as a boon opportunity why to maintain links with the country which had already cut itself off from the rest of the world the unusual family spent a year living at the embassy in a residential suburb of bern [Music] joel the eldest enrolled at a nearby international school for the children of diplomats and businessmen [Music] his brother hun joined a state school in the town he spoke german with his classmates after a few difficult months he was said to be a rowdy loner but he finally made a handful of swiss friends and settled into school life and he was very much into sports and he was particularly interested in basketball he was very keen and quite good at it around this time the pack family moved into an ordinary apartment near the school visitors were not welcome but there were photos of the property on the estate agent's website showing a standard middle-class family home [Music] living here meant the children could enjoy a free and easy life with their friends they sometimes had lessons in swiss democracy at school they even got to visit the swiss parliament and then yes he made friends some of them even told us that they were invited to his home to play game boy et cetera kim jong-un we also know that kim jong-un used to play basketball with his neighborhood friends not necessarily of his own class pretty much every evening and that he was a perfectly pleasant kid like all kids of his age the pictures we have of pakhun are in sharp contrast with the images we have of kim jong-un how can we be certain that this is the same man who spent his entire adolescence in switzerland judicial identification experts compared the two images facial spacing ears teeth there seemed to be no possible doubt added to which another clue was unearthed by the swiss secret service a north korean woman by the name of ko young-hee regularly arrived in switzerland by private plane the swiss agents who tailed her suspected she was smuggling precious metals but the truth was something else altogether [Music] so she would arrive and usually stay two three or four months and she would stay at the house too but she would also go off on regular shopping trips in the great capitals of europe or there would be big family get-togethers i was told about a family reunion which took place in a hotel at interlaken for instance where the family rented out a whole wing of the hotel and met up there during the 90s kim jong-il's private life was a state secret nobody knew about his three mistresses and four children and when his health started to deteriorate north korea's neighbors were worried about who would succeed him and what might happen if kim jong-il were to disappear suddenly [Music] but within the kim family's secretive bosom the decision had long since been made [Music] the eldest son kim jong-nam would have seemed to be the natural successor in the confucian tradition just as kim jong-il had inherited power from his father but kim jong-nam had committed several gaffes among them an embarrassing arrest in tokyo with a fake passport he had wanted to visit disneyland with his family the second son kim jong-chol educated in switzerland was considered too soft even too feminine by his father kim jong-un may well have been the youngest son but he was also the son of kim jong-il's greatest love ko young-hee the former dancer would play a significant role in the corridors of power [Music] played an important part in ensuring that her son took over the reigns of power kim jong-nam the eldest son already had an important role in the country's hierarchy with an elevated position at the general bureau of data processing where he specialized in communication networks but since kim jong-un took control kim jong-nam has found himself in an awkward position he can no longer return to north korea the 17th of december 2011 north korea was in mourning kim jong-il the shining sun of the 21st century had died just a few days before it was time for the propaganda machine to set up the funeral scene the funeral would also be the confirmation of the youngest son's accession which had been confirmed to north korea and the rest of the world a year earlier [Music] kim jong-il was ruling the country or you know basically had senior positions in the country for quite some time before he became the leader at least 10 years um that he is he was involved and kim jong-un i think he all came very suddenly um they did it the propaganda they did a bit of going back and sort of trying to create a story about how he was being trained many years in advance but that wasn't the case at all i mean the fact of the matter was that his father had had the first stroke and that's when they started becoming concerned about succession and then he died quite suddenly and i think the young fellow was not ready there was a plan i think to have him become the next leader but i imagine they were thinking five ten years not one year and so you know i i think it was very clear from the funeral and everything you know the way he looked and the way he was behaving that he was in shock and not really ready to take over kim jong-un's problems had already begun [Music] did the aging generals gathered around his father's coffin sees such a young leader in a favorable light kim il-sung the founder of the nation staked his claim by leading the anti-japanese guerrilla army during the second world war kim jong-il was the regime's second in command for 15 years or so and then assumed power after 50 years kim jong-un however was a mere 26 years old with no experience and no reputation to precede him so in order to keep his grip on the reins of power he embarked on a monstrous purge the regime needed to be represented by a whole new generation the kanye west today kim jong-un needs to connect with people who remember the great famine from their childhood i believe it will be harder to maintain solidarity between the elite and the leader than it was for the two previous regimes things could be rather fraught and so the power structure will be built on a foundation of differing interests and terror you know i i think that there probably is a lot of internal churn there because what seemed to be clear is that after kim jong-un did take power he was trying to move some of the business concessions and the political power in the military that his father put there right his father believed in so-called military first politics and move it over to the party or at least balance out the party and the military all of the generals that were with kim jong-un by the hearse of his father in the funeral procession are all gone none of them are left and so very clearly he's wiped out a group and is trying to bring in a new group the most prominent victim of the purge was just behind him during the funeral uncle jang seong tek married to kim jong-il's sister since the 70s this member by marriage of the family had been at the very heart of power his brothers were powerful generals he himself had held a number of key posts in the armed forces in the economy when kim jong-il's health first started to become a cause for concern his name was mentioned as a potential successor or at least as a regent to the dictator's young son two years after coming to power kim jong-un decided that his apprenticeship was over and had his uncle executed along with most of his closest relatives [Music] for us was a very competent man i work with him he was funny and kind to his subordinates he took good care of us and worked hard certainly the news of his arrest and then his execution were quite surprising to many of us who study this country but i think what was the most surprising was the written statement that came out explaining why he had been killed you know in the past in north korea when these sorts of things happen they happen very quietly it's a car accident or it's a sickness and there's really not much explanation given but in this case you know a very clear explanation in many ways exposing vulnerabilities inside of north korea the charge sheet accused jansen tech of wanting to overthrow the regime this was a tacit admission of a struggle at the heart of the power structure he was also accused of being an unfaithful husband and a corrupt communist and rumors of his fondness for young girls were confirmed by the official press was very damaging for the regime north korea is a deeply confucianist country where respect for one's elders especially relatives is ingrained murdering his own uncle was more likely to harm the people's loyalty to kim jong-un and consolidate his power i think the members of the elite who lose respect for their leader could also turn away from him [Music] in order for his accession to power to succeed kim jong-un decided to use terror to subdue the regime's old guard [Music] he then concentrated all the key posts and surrounded himself with those loyal to him i think that kim jong-un is in charge i don't think that there are puppets behind him because i think the system is designed to only have one person in charge and so and everybody must demonstrate their personal loyalty to him in order to survive 20 million koreans live in the city of seoul the capital of south korea 20 million people more obsessed with their own success than with kim jong-un however closer scrutiny reveals that the whole city is ready for war the military's control over the city makes it an impregnable citadel a vast underground network was conceived as a shelter from any attack by the north but people no longer notice the gas masks and the emergency rations provided in ever dwindling numbers in the underground stations i'm not worried about war i've done my national service their nuclear capacity on the other hand that does worry me greatly i don't understand why he wants to develop nuclear weapons to blackmail us to threaten us to get something out of us or just for his own personal glory their nuclear threat seems to be their only survival mechanism [Music] the north korean border is only 30 kilometers away [Music] it's an impossible demilitarized zone two kilometers across with hundreds of thousands of soldiers either side of it seoul is well within range of cannon fire the soldiers in the south can see villages in the north unlike his father kim jong-un personally inspects the advanced posts which are the greatest threat to seoul [Music] the main difference that was felt in the early days of the kim jong-un era was that he seemed much more belligerent and hostile than kim jong-il this was particularly noticeable in his military policy it was very public he didn't try to hide it he stressed the importance of operations designed for a potential confrontation with south korea [Music] he increasingly put his armed forces on a war footing this approach was illustrated by the training and exercises that the north koreans were subjected to [Music] [Applause] kim jong-un made his first north korean propaganda appearance a year before his father's death he was made a four-star general signifying his arrival at the heart of power in north korea power means first and foremost the army [Music] i believe that he attended uh for a period of time perhaps maybe six months uh one of the military academies uh they have given him some titles uh and of course he you know the way that they're creating the myth is that he planned the chonun sinking and the shelling of waipido so i i don't believe he has any credible military experience but i think that they are trying to create that myth you know he was given the title as a four-star general um in uh in one of the people's assemblies as they were making the transition but not in not any experience that we know of the propaganda says he's a he's an artillery expert uh so they try to create a myth around him that shows that he's a great warrior a great military man and i'm sure for the military in north korea you know they they probably don't like that you know that this young fellow with no experience all of a sudden gets four stars and is considered one of the top military brass in the country even though he has no experience [Music] the north korean army consists of over a million men and 6 million reservists morale boosting inspections of all units is a daily obligation for the great leader [Music] but the army's thousands of tanks and hundreds of aircraft inherited from soviet era moscow are all but obsolete [Music] pyongyang and so 90 miles 20 miles to the border with the dmz you you you don't need such conventional sophisticated weaponry you need the manpower the you know the multiple rocket launchers i mean within 90 minutes it could be a disaster so and then there's also the asymmetrical side i mean we're looking at the military in the conventional sense with conventional weapons and then we're saying oh the priority's been the missile and the nuclear program absolutely there's also asymmetrical warfare looking at other capabilities like cyber capabilities and and what have you and and and elements of weapons of mass destruction it's not only nuclear but you've got biological program chemical programs so i think this is a government that's invested heavily in their military but it always it doesn't always come across in their conventional military capabilities it's it's a myriad of capabilities and some of them are very potent i mean we all have to care about north korea let's be practical north korea has nuclear weapons it's the knight of the nuclear weapons state the assessment is from six to twelve maybe even more nuclear weapons right and they're developing their programs they have a uranium enrichment program to build nuclear weapons they have missile systems they have the scud they have the no dogs they have the typo down they're building the kno8 which is an intercontinent intercontinental ballistic missile which is a mobile missile solid fuel so it's great capabilities so north korea is persisting with their nuclear program that missile program that and the the prospects of proliferating some of that selling some of that material [Music] kim jong-il's nuclear program was his grand project but his son decided to carry it on and even to intensify its development while its conventional arsenal was not up to the job of fighting its enemies the atomic bomb became a north korean obsession despite international objections a huge amount of resources was poured into the project pyongyang believed that owning the atom bomb was the only way the regime could [Music] survive it is the only deterrent to its great enemy the usa with whom it was at war during the 1950s washington perfectly well understands the relationship between the superpower and the small asian country the memorial to the korean war is just a few blocks away from the white house since the 1953 ceasefire the american government has kept a close eye on the korean crisis thirty thousand soldiers are still stationed on the south side of the demilitarized zone crises and crisis management scenarios are constantly being reevaluated this show of strength is seen by pyongyang as a direct threat to its survival i think that you know they fear the chauchesku end uh they fear the qadhafi end the saddam end all those those leaders who have lost because they didn't have nuclear weapons they made agreements with the united states or their people rebelled in chauchesky's case they don't want to end up in those cases and when they look to south korea you know they they don't believe that they will be given uh you know a future in south korea and clearly a democratic south who would try and send a jail their own presidents you know they can only imagine what they would do to north korean you know to to the regime given the atrocities uh and crimes against humanity that they've committed north korea's goal is to uh if you will to to place north korea in the situation so that no one in the rest of the world would dare attack north korea having said that while the media today has tremendous focus on this question can north korean missiles reach alaska or california or wherever in reality north korea today has the capability of transferring weapons of mass destruction anywhere in the world through its trading companies their affiliates and a very sophisticated shipping network so north korea already has the ability worldwide to deliver wmd anywhere north korea is already a nuclear threat but it has also been developing some of the world's most powerful cyber warfare units for example they attacked the south korean financial system as well as sony's film studios in the us in the wake of a comedy movie which openly mocked kim jong-un you know many of us who have negotiated with north korea uh and i'm one of certainly one of them i have great respect for their capabilities but those who have not spent much time in north korea or dealing with the north koreans they say you look as a country i can't feed its people if you have nourishment going on and so forth and you have this economic development which is minimal if anything i mean the public distribution system doesn't work you compare north korea to south korea i mean there's no comparison no i mean south korea is a is a mar in a country that has significant gdp and per capita income is high and north korea since the 60s has just gone down and down having been at a high level at one point and going down and down so they've not done that in in in in that way but they have but we should never under estimate their capabilities when they put their mind to it they're very effective when they put their mind to a nuclear program they're very good no one many people said they could never have a uranium enrichment program with spinning centrifuges that's sophistication of course they could missile delivery systems of course they could you mentioned cyber i'm of the school yes if they put their mind to it they don't need an internet system per se they need people who are focusing on cyber technologies the tools necessary and how you do that and so forth and they're very good when they put their mind to it so i have high respect for the north koreans when they when they focus when they focus their attention and put the resources behind it on on on capabilities building capabilities one thing every north korean leader has understood and he does as well i think if they lower their guard in their perspective if they lower their guard they will be treated by the major powers as the used furniture of history they'll simply be discarded walked over ignored otherwise why paying attention to them so they have to make sure that people care about them that they people don't see just a dark spot on the map which is a favorite thing when we show but understand that this is a real uh operating not failing country with 24 million people that are somehow going to continue to exist and become more vibrant in northeast asia that's a big that's a tall order to fill and who knows if he'll be able to achieve it in order to maintain his grip on power kim jong-un decided to fight a war on two fronts one of these was the pre-eminence of the army and the apparatus of repression the young leader spoke openly about the country's poverty he claimed he would not be able to sleep until his people had an adequate standard of living [Music] from his youngest days kim jong-un spent a long time with his father's japanese chef who became his close companion [Music] the japanese chef recalls the future dictator's innermost nocturnal thoughts it was nearly 5 00 a.m we spoke of many things he told me i've been to europe to asia to japan several times the shops are full of food that he was determined to go down the route of economic liberalization and reform every day propaganda portrays kim jong-un as the great orchestrator of the renaissance of north korea's agriculture and economy early results were modest but the country seemed to have consigned to history the famines which decimated the population during the nineties you know in his first speech in april 2012 i got the impression that his one of his main goals was to convince his own people and the rest of the world that this was in one sense a new north korea many of the things that happened in the past were of the past our people's army must be the embodiment of our great general slogan help the people the people's army soldiers and officers do more for the people than they would do for their own families our people are the finest people in they have the world the party in face of great challenges they should never have to tighten their belts again they should be able to benefit fully from the riches of socialism that is our party's firmest resolution his focus is on the future now he's going to be able to build the north korea he's hoping for and it looks to be something obviously more prosperous able to stand up better against south korea even though they'll never catch up to south korea and they have a military strong enough so that they have to be taken seriously north koreans do not live in abject poverty like they once did we no longer have an absolute famine we now live relatively well there's just a gap between rich and poor but there is no longer extreme penury you may see awful images of starving north koreans but that was 10 15 years ago it isn't the case nowadays north korea is churning internally as we speak there are amazing changes occurring within that country kim jong-un is allowing an unprecedented number of people to leave the country to learn about the basics of business to learn about international economics to learn about how to transition from a controlled economy to a market economy now this is remarkable that he he is allowing this sort of situation to occur north koreans are now able to go to singapore to learn about the basics of business north koreans go to hong kong they go to vietnam as we speak there are north koreans in canada learning about international economics and at the same time north korea is actually allowing a certain number of people including some from singapore to go into north korea and to discuss the basics of business so this is a different day a different world and it is impossible at this point in time to ascertain what this will mean and what the consequences will be from what we know anecdotally from people who have been in the not just in pyongyang but in the countryside there are resources being devoted to development housing infrastructure some extent food maybe in the in the agriculture area it looks as if there are some reforms or changes that are going to lead could lead to increased harvest none of these things at this point are real big and anybody in north korea who's who's implementing them probably is a little bit worried that they might get reversed because it's not yet clear that they've been completely and totally endorsed from the top but there's a cumulative effect a new economy for a political beast born of the cold war just like when china's deng xiaoping opened the country for business while playing father of the nation but north korea's psychological control over its people reaches a whole new level like that of a secretive sect will it be able to survive this new openness i think in general because they they have no problem with getting cash right through uh small projects like kumgang mountain or the north south joint industrial complex but something that really opens the country up to open to free market forces that allows for free and open exchange these are all things that may make them richer but it is seen as a threat to political control and that's what we've seen throughout asia you know if the economy start to grow you get middle-class incomes they start demanding more political freedoms you know this is what we saw in taiwan it's what we saw in the in in south korea we've seen this throughout history and asia and i think they they're very threatened by that so they're not willing to to take the big steps in terms of economic reform even though this young fellow spent some time in switzerland right was educated in the west you know i think for that for exactly that reason he understands the threats that come with trying to open up too much for kim jong-un it's a matter of survival after the years of poverty of his father's reign north koreans need to be given a new sense of hope if the country is going to stay together his cheerful appearances and chubby frame contribute to the resurrection of the image of kim il-sung who he has come to resemble physically [Music] in north korea even the smallest child in the street loves kim il-sung he was the great leader during his time people ate well and were not poor it was from the reign of kim jong-il that the country experienced the worst poverty so kim jong-un is trying to show that he is not like his father but like his grandfather whom everybody loves and that's why he tries to be like his grandfather now [Music] grandfather kim il-sung the revered founder of north korea is still the official eternal president of the country at times during his reign its development was faster than that of south korea thanks to the unconditional support of the kremlin but when the soviet bloc fell pyongyang had to change its tune its economy fell apart and under kim jong-il's rule the country endured the great famine [Music] by adopting his grandfather's style kim jong-un seeks to recreate the mythical glory years he wants to make a link between this supposed glorious past and the new generation brought up during the dark days and now being sent all over the world to learn about economic reforms a new generation which sees a leader in its own image who enjoys basketball and theme parks and is happy to mingle with the general population in front of the lenses of the propaganda machine whereas kim jong-il clearly found it difficult to even shake north koreans by the hand it seems to me it's a combination of a very deliberate effort to have him be different from his father to be more open at least to appear more open to the people to mix with them more freely uh there's one wonderful uh episode at least to me a couple of them actually one of them is when he went to uh one of the newly built apartment houses and in in the process of welcoming this couple he sits on the floor with them and has his wife sitting beside him like everybody's korean mother i just you just can't imagine kim jong-il ever doing anything like that you might imagine kim il-sung doing that it's possible the other thing was when kim jong-un was was on-site guidance for a army unit a female army unit and when he was leaving he didn't just take a picture with the entire unit he stood there and the young women came up one at a time like he was a rock star they grabbed his arm and had their pictures taken i just i was so astounded i couldn't not imagine uh that ever happening before something that seemed equally unimaginable was to hear kim jong-il's voice throughout his reign the only propaganda put out was either silent films or images he never spoke in public kim jong-il couldn't speak he had a stutter so he couldn't speak in public i only ever heard his voice through a door when he was having a meeting with his chiefs of staff he struggled with language kim jong-un on the other hand he can talk moreover he talks like his grandfather he even imitates his voice so in the beginning it was even said that kim il-sung had been resurrected it had become like an actor's job to recreate his image [Music] our nuclear capacity is our guarantee of protecting our national sovereignty it allows us to build peace prosperity and power as well as the happiness of the people [Applause] there is a generational difference for one thing in my eyes kim jong-un and kim jong-il have different styles studied abroad so would have a closer understanding of international criteria therefore he seems more normal than kim jong-il who had too many wives and wanted to keep his family especially his sons hidden so i think he's trying to demonstrate that he has a relatively normal presidential style [Applause] but how can one follow a normal path when one comes from a family with such history kim jong-un seems to have chosen to allow a degree of transparency where his family is concerned since the beginning of his reign he has shown off his wife she accompanies him on his many excursions immaculately turned out she occasionally treats herself to luxury toiletry items north korea has for the first time its own first lady always smiling she is a symbol of modernity and diversity kim jong-il for his part had a great many secret mistresses most of them selected from among the ranks of the regime's official artistic community this troop was conceived essentially as a harem for the dear leaders kim jong-un's mother like his wife issued from these ranks it was at the end of his adolescence that kim jong-un could begin to make his choice kim jong-un was never forbidden from going out with girls but he just wasn't interested that day amongst the pleasure brigade there was a buxom young lady kim jong-un called me over and said fujimoto look at those puppies i was so relieved to hear him say that i told myself he's a lad and everything's gonna be fine [Music] there is one other woman to whom the regime is giving an increasingly significant profile [Music] she was seen behind kim jong-un during his father's funeral although the propagandist never named this young woman in mourning [Music] she's the dictator's younger sister kim yo-jong and her trousers or her nappies would start to fall down it was always kim jong-un who noticed watch out watch out he would say and he would pull them up he was so so he's doing exactly what his father did just the same what's interesting is the strong women he surrounds himself with there was a picture of him when he opened one of the fun parks he's walking not only got his wife he had his aunt kim jong-il's sister he had his his father's last consort who was apparently a very strong woman i can't remember there was one or two more so it's not completely a patriarchal system there it seems to me he's i guess he's listening to women as well kim jong-un is grooming his sister for succession in case any crisis like a health issue should befall the regime in late 2014 the dictator disappeared for a few months because of a surgical procedure on his ankle even then his transparency in the official media was astonishing portraying a limping convalescent this remarkable contrast with the image of a living god so commonplace in korea's daily life almost seems to embarrass even him just like when the soldiers he's visiting seem to be completely irrationally magnetized by his presence there's nothing special about these pictures it's perfectly normal here in north korea kim jong-un is like jesus if you were a christian and you were to see jesus aboard a boat by the river wouldn't you try to follow him this is no different [Music] clearly it's all very far-fetched the great leader who can make grenades from pine cones the great leader who can move at supernatural speed even the weather is linked to his greatness every song sings his praises you can't take it all too seriously but brainwashing is very dangerous when people are constantly exposed to songs videos and moving or even grandiose stories they start to believe them it's what's called mass psychology [Music] this allows north korean television to present the dictator as an instructor for airline pilots [Music] this scenario may appear ridiculous to an expert but it's part and parcel of the regime's tenor one question springs to mind when watching these images to what extent does the main actor believe in the play and to what extent has this fever pitch propaganda influenced kim jong-un's persona you see humanity in the man smiling and reaching out to the people and engaging and then you say my god how how could you do that to your own people how could you have been so brutal to your own uncle how does that come together but this is what we're looking at we're seeing a leader who's and that's why people say he's he has not been that rational an actor on one hand you see the humanity in the man the charisma and the other saying you see the brutality and you say what do we have here [Music] at the frontier between the two careers the century posts have become tourist destinations south koreans come here for a family outing on sundays to take a look at these vestiges of the separation between the two countries [Music] i don't know it's difficult to get any real information about kim jong-un other than what's disseminated by the media but when i see that i get the feeling that he won't remain in power for long even germany reunified and korea is only a tiny little country yet we remain separated for korea to be powerful and prosperous i believe it needs to be reunified kim jong-un his demeanor worries me i think he's too young he comes across as more aggressive and unstable because he's young i think he's a very dangerous man i would uh say with uh stake my 34 years in the military on the south korean military would defeat north korea but it will be bloody it will be tragic south korea will suffer tremendous destruction and as i started out saying the entire world will be impacted at least economically if there is a war could this final frontier of the cold war possibly fall for many koreans the question is now irrelevant personal and family connections have all but vanished after 60 years of separation 60 years of watching the kim family show in pyongyang a soap opera which holds the keys to the future of the korean peninsula [Music] [Music] [Music] you
