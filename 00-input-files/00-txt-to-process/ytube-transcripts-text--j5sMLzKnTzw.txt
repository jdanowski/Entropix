maybe we could start i think by just allowing you to tell your story uh so you can start wherever you'd like and thank you exactly as you mentioned in the after soviet union collapsed they were stop helping north korean regime and north korean regime is like run by central government economy so they decide how much how much rice you can eat that day per person based on their class so even though the biggest irony of north korea is that it was founded the idea of equality make everybody the same the communism and then they call it themselves as a socialist paradise but they made it into north koreans into three big categories of classes and within three categories they divided 50 subcategories of classes so it became the most unequal society that you can imagine right now in our human history uh i was born in the northern part of north korea so during this great famine that was man-made feminine by king regime that's where most of north koreans died in the northern part where i was born and the people in kenya in the capital they were still very fed so the motor example that i found was actually the hunger games there is a capital and they divide 13 different districts they make everybody else outside the capital on verge of surviving so people do not think about what is the meaning of life what is freedom all they have to think about is next meal like can i find food to feed my child and in pyongyang they are really very fed and they have every intention to maintain the system and the regime so that's where i was born at i mean in the 1993 uh seeing the dead bodies on the streets it was a literally everyday thing i never knew that that was like a weird word and that's what got me the first when i came out people were saying like you know why there is no revolution in north korea and first of all we don't even know the vocabulary revolution in north korea it's a country where they don't teach us about the word love there's no romantic love in north korea i never heard my mom telling me that she loved me the only word that we know love is that written form of the word where we describe our feelings towards next deal leader not about to another human so there is no word for love no word for human rights dignity i mean freedom and that's why you know people in north korea they don't know they are they are oppressed they don't know they are slaves you said the information control was so total that you had absolutely no idea what was happening in the outside world and you believed at that time that other despite what you saw around you that other countries were much worse so even here right now in this 21st century north koreans do not even know the existence of internet and we do not even have electricity so of course in school i never even seen the map of the world i never even knew so in school in north korea they teach me that they don't teach me that i'm an asian they teach me that i'm a chemist some ways and north korean calendar begins now when the jesus christ was born when kim your son was born so they cut out entire information and people literally get executed for watching foreign information and that is a crime to be dead in north korea so you do not have a freedom even to travel abroad it's an entire black hole of information you don't know outside that cave what's happening but of course like like the leaders like kim jong he went to school in switzerland the type elites go on but the people in the bottom most of them do not even never even seen the map of the world and we don't even know what africa other continents other race and that was like me and you described the conditions that you grew up in so you're first of all what what stands out quite remarkably is the degree of hunger so tell me a bit about what it was like when you were a kid in the 90s in korea with regards to eating so as the north koreans are on average three to four inch shorter than south koreans because of the malnutrition and i'm like five two but most of north carolina are shorter than me so if we are above four ten feet high you must go to military so tons of north korean adornment are around 4 10 like even below that right now so this severe malnutrition affects in our brain development north korea's average life expectancy is like if somebody lives up to 60 we think they lived a really long life like my grandmother who who died from mostly malnutrition before her 60 every thought i thought oh you should live long enough to do that so it is a different planet we are talking about uh being in north korea of course like only way for me to get my proteins or eating in a grasshoppers dragonflies a lot of insects tree barks plants flowers and that's how we survive and most of people die in the spring because that's when there is no like really insects and plants are and that's where every spring there's most people dying and majority people die in that time yes and you said that for you and for the people around you spring wasn't a time of hope and renewal but the absolute worst time of the year and so maybe you can explain now yeah yeah so every spring i remember my skin sort of like cut off from the like vitamin likeness that i would get busy and it's like season of death every spring the people who couldn't wait until the summer so the plants grow and that's when like we all know that tons of people are gonna die and as you remember i escaped in the spring i end the march of 2007 one day i had a really bad stomachache and my mom took me to the hospital but in north korea of course there's no electricity there's no x-ray machines none of that literally all nurse using one meter to inject every patient in the hospital and people don't die from cancer in north korea they die from infection and hunger mostly and the doctor literally told my mom that she has appendix i think we gotta operate on her like right now in this afternoon and they do not use anesthesia it's a very like people not don't use any stage in north korea they would call my belly open that afternoon and i was thinking and they said oh she's just manually she gets an infection she doesn't have any appendix but and then they close in a bag and then literally from our hospital to the bathroom they were like parts of human bodies piled up and you see children like chasing the rats eating just rats even human eyes first and then children catch these rats and they eat and they somehow die from i don't know what it is then let's eat the children back so this cycle of us eating rats and they eat a spice going continue and continue yeah and you said that was happening in the hospital you also mentioned that in that episode that you woke up before the surgery was over because the anesthetic ran out it was yeah it was uh it was not even like actually a full anesthetic it was more like a dose of like a sleeping pill like a lot of tons of it so most of people in north korea right now even when they cut their legs open storing their bones they do not give any anesthesia because the free health care and vision do not provide anything for the people so yeah you mentioned as well and so we can talk about your familial situation that in the 1990s the average wage in korea was the equivalent of two dollars a month and so a dollar ninety a day is what the un regards as the the line between poverty like absolute privation related poverty and enough to barely subsist on a dollar ninety a day and so north koreans were making as much in a month as the u.n allows for poverty in a day and you describe um well eating virtually nothing rice was a luxury other forms of food especially protein were virtually unheard of including fruit and you in some of the most memorable sections you described going out into the fields with some other children and you were about seven or eight years old i guess at this time and catching dragonflies and roasting them with uh with a lighter and that was where you got your protein that is uh that's yeah i mean i ate tons of grasshoppers i remember always even though it was a free education let me go to school so in north korea there's no concept of minor they or and there's no concept of i they don't allow us to use the word i so even though like i say i like food they say we like food we like our country so and in this scenario when we go to school they all view us as a revolutionaries and therefore even the children when they go to school even eight seven nine years old we all have to work in a manner construction zones so therefore children even when they can afford to go to school it doesn't really mean much to them go to school and most of children now in north korea cannot afford to go to school and stay at home and that was like my job and parents go out to find food children would like clean and bring the drinking water we don't even have a sewage and going to mountains and bring a lot of the firewood because we don't have gas or coal anything we have to find anything we can find in the nature to cook food so it's almost like 16th century of lifestyle that we go to the river and we bathe in the summer time and in the winter we don't bathe and only a few times we take baths and that's why sometimes cannot believe that this is the same life that i'm living in right now
