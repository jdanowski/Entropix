a big trip we're just leaving but we wanted to have a little bit of a conference just to announce what's happened how we've done and i think it's been very very successful we've concluded a really tremendously uh successful g7 and would like to provide you with an update and you know the gentleman up are the legendary larry kudlow and the legendary john baldwin we had a good meeting both on defense and environment and frankly on tariffs which are what we're here for first i'd like to thank prime minister trudeau for hosting this summit it has worked out to be so wonderful the people of canada are wonderful and it's a great country and a very beautiful country i might add we tackled the variety of issues and opportunities facing our nations at the top of the list was the issue of trade very important subject because the united states has been taken advantage of for decades and decades and we can't do that anymore we had extremely productive discussions on the need to have fair and reciprocal meaning to save people can't charge us 270 percent and we charge them nothing that doesn't work anymore i made a lot of statements having to do with clarity we want and expect other nations to provide fair market access to american exports and that we will take whatever steps are necessary to protect american industry and workers from unfair foreign trading practices of which really there are many but we're getting them straightened down slowly but surely we also discussed the issue of uncontrolled migration and the threat that it poses to both national security and other other groups and countries and our citizens and quality of life we're committed to addressing the migration challenge by helping migrants to remain and prosper in their own home countries a wide array of national security threats were addressed including the threat of iran the g7 nations remain committed to controlling iran's nuclear ambitions with or without them those ambitions are going to be controlled along with efforts to combat terrorism and extremism and those who spread this deadly ideology the nations of the g7 are bound together by shared values and beliefs that came out loud and clear each of our nations is totally unique with our own people and our own sovereign obligations but we can coordinate together and achieve a common good and good for all and for all of our people all of our nations were linked in the great effort to create a more just peaceful and prosperous world and from the standpoint of trade and jobs and being fair to companies we are really i think committed i think they are starting to be committed to a much more fair trade situation for the united states because it has been treated very very unfairly and i don't blame other leaders for that i blame our past leaders there was no reason that this should have happened last year they lost 800 we as a nation over the years but the latest numbers 817 billion dollars on trade that's ridiculous and it's unacceptable and everybody was told that so i don't blame them i blame our leaders in fact i congratulate the leaders of other countries for so crazily being able to make these trade deals that were so good for their country and so bad for the united states but those days are over in just a few minutes i'll be leaving for singapore i'll be on a mission of peace and we will carry in really in my heart we're going to be carrying the hearts of millions of people people from all over the world we have to get denuclearization we have to get something going we really think that north korea will be a tremendous place in a very short period of time and we appreciate everything that's going on and we appreciate the working together with north korea they're really working very well with us so i say so far so good we're going to have to see what happens and we're going to know very soon so i'll be leaving as soon as we're finished with this conference i'll be leaving and i very much look forward to it i think it's very important for north korea and south korea and japan and the world and the united states it's a great day and we'll see what happens okay any questions yes yes mr president uh you are about to embark on what may be the most important meeting you've ever had in your life what's in your gut meals of stir uh steel nerves or butterflies can you describe how you well it's always everything and so you know this has probably rarely been done it's unknown territory in the truest sense but i really feel confident i feel that kim jong-un wants to do something great for his people and he has that opportunity and he won't have that opportunity again it's never going to be there again so i really believe that he's going to do something very positive for his people for himself his family he's got an opportunity the likes of which i think almost if you look into history very few people have ever had he can take that nation with those great people and truly make it great so it's a one-time it's a one-time shot and i think it's going to work out very well that's why i feel positive because it makes so much sense and we will watch over we'll protect and we'll do a lot of things i can say that south korea japan china many countries want to see it happen and they'll help they're all help so there's a great there's really this is a a great time this has not happened in all of the years that they've been separated by a very artificial boundary this is a great opportunity for peace and lasting peace and prosperity yes do you expect to meet him ma'am indiana this summer yeah i have not spoken to vladimir putin in quite a while it has been discussed we didn't do votes or anything but it has been discussed some people like the idea of bringing russia back in this used to be the g8 not the g7 and something happened a while ago where uh russia is no longer in i think it would be an asset to have russia back in i think it would be good for the world i think it would be good for russia i think it would be good for the united states i think would be good for all of the countries of the current g7 i think the g8 would be better i think having russia back in would be a positive thing we're looking for peace in the world we're not looking to play games okay uh question yes mr president said that this was a positive meeting but from the outside it seemed quite contentious did you get any indication from your intellect computers that you were they were going to make any concessions to you and i believe that you raised the idea of a tariff-free g7 is that is that i did oh i did that's where it should be no tariffs no barriers that would that's the way it should be no subsidies i even said no tariffs in other words let's say canada where we have tremendous tariffs the united states pays tremendous tariffs on dairy as an example 270 percent nobody knows that we pay nothing we don't want to pay anything why should we pay we have to ultimately that's what you want you want a tariff free you want no barriers and you want no subsidies because you have some cases where countries are subsidizing industries and that's not fair so you go terror free you go barrier free you go subsidy free that's the way you learned at the wharton school of finance i mean that would be the ultimate thing now whether or not that works but i did suggest it and people were i guess they're going to go back to the drawing board and check it out right but we can't have uh an example where we're paying the united states as paying 270 percent can't have it and when they send things into us you don't have that i will say it was not contentious what was strong was the language that this cannot go on but the relationships are very good whether it be president macron or with justin we had justin did a really good job uh i think the relationships were outstanding but because of the fact that the united states leaders of the past didn't do a good job on trade and again i'm not blaming countries i'm blaming our people that represented our past it's going to change it's going to change i mean it's not a question of i hope it changes it's going to change 100 and tariffs are going to come way down because we people cannot continue to do that we're like the piggy bank that everybody's robbing and that ends in fact larry kudlow is a great expert on this and he's a total free trader but even larry has seen the ravages of what they've done with their tariffs would you like to say something larry very quickly might be interesting well one interesting point in terms of the g7 group meeting i don't know if they were surprised with president trump's free trade proclamation but they certainly listened to it and we had lengthy discussions about that as the prince said well reduce these barriers in fact go to zero zero tariffs zero non-tariff areas zero subsidies and along the way we're gonna have to clean up the international trading system about which there was virtual consensus of agreement on that and that will be a target and these are the best ways to promote economic growth we'll all be better at it we'll all be stronger at it so i myself was particularly gratified to hear my president talk about free trade thank you and it's very unfair to our farmers our farmers are essentially whether it's through a barrier non-monetary barrier or whether it's through very high tariffs that make it impossible and this is all over the world this isn't just you said i mean we have india where some of the tariffs are 100 100 and we charge nothing can't do that and so we are talking to many countries we're talking all countries and it's going to stop well we'll stop trading with them and that's a very profitable answer we have to do yes sir uh thank you mr president another question on trade you just said that you think that the tariffs are actually going to come down but it does appear that these various countries are moving forward with retaliatory tariffs on the us did you get any concessions or any agreements with any of these countries not to move forward with those tariffs and are you willing to not move forward well if they retaliate they make a mistake because you see we have a tremendous trade imbalance so when we try and bring our peace up a little bit so that it's not so bad and then they go up right the difference is they do so much more business with us than we do with them that we can't lose that your state we can't lose it and as an example with one country we have 375 billion in trade deficits we can't lose you could make the case that they lost years ago but when you're down 375 billion you can't lose and we have to bring them up so there's very bad spirit when we have a big trade imbalance and we want to bring it up to balance just balance and they keep raising and so did you never catch uh that's not a good thing to do and we have very very strong measures that take care of that because we do so much the numbers are so astronomically against them in terms of anything as per your question we win that war a thousand times out of a thousand yes yes sir so two things can happen on nafta we'll either leave it the way it is as a threesome deal with canada with the united states and mexico and change over substantially we're talking about very big changes or we're going to make a deal directly with canada directly with mexico both of those things could happen if a deal isn't made that would be a very bad thing for canada and it would be a very bad thing for mexico for the united states frankly it would be a good thing but i'm not looking to do that i'm not looking to play that game so we're either going to have nafta in a better negotiated form or we're going to have two deals it'll have a sunset you have the two sunsets i mean you have a isds provision and a sunset provision they've been very heavily negotiated uh you have two sunsets two concepts of sunset we're pretty close to the sunset division okay well we have one that's five years you know it very well you studied this very well congratulations that's right you have one group that likes to have five years and then a renegotiation at the end of five years and you have another group that wants longer because of the investments so but we're pretty close yes sir mr president david harrison from politico europe just to come back to russia for a second there's something that happened that got him kicked out of the g8 was the invasion and annexation of crimea do you think that crimea should be recognized with russia well you know you have to ask president obama because he was the one that let crimea get away that was during his administration and he was the one that let russia go and spend a lot of money on crimea because they spent a lot of money on rebuilding it i guess they have their submarine port there etc but crimea was let go during the obama administration and you know obama can say all he wants but he allowed russia to take crimea i may have had a much different attitude but so you really have to ask that question to president obama you know why did he do that why did he do that but with that being said it's been done a long time but you would allow russia back into the g8 with crimea still i would rather see russia in the ga as opposed to the g7 i would say that the g8 is a more meaningful group than the g7 absolutely yes yes ma'am how persuasive did you find the europeans and canadians when they made the case to you that you shouldn't use national security as a justification for tariffs they virtually didn't even make that case my case is the fact that it is national security it's our balance sheet it's our uh it's our strength it's absolutely national security and you know if you look at our just take a look at our balance sheet we're gonna have a very strong balance sheet very soon because of what i'm doing we have the strongest economy that we've ever had in the united states in the history of the united states we have the best unemployment numbers black unemployment the lowest in history hispanic unemployment the lowest in history i don't mean the lowest in the last 10 years or 20 years the lowest in the history of this country black unemployment is doing the best it's ever done hispanic doing the best women are now up to 21 years soon it's going to be the best ever in its history in the country's history we have to we have to have deals that are fair and we have to have deals that are economic otherwise that does in fact affect our military but how do you make that case for autism oh it's very easy it's economic it's the balance sheet to have a great military you need a great balance sheet okay yes as you were heading into these g7 talks there was a sense that uh america's closest allies were frustrated with you and angry with you and that you were angry with them and that you were leaving here early to go meet for more friendlier talks with kim jong-un and singapore and i'm wondering if you will if you would if you view it the same way and do you view the us alliance system shifting under your presidency who are you with advertising cnn the worst uh but you know i can tell by the question i have no idea you were cnn after the question i was just curious as to who you're with you were seeing that i would say that the level of relationship is a ten we have a great relationship angela and emmanuel and justin i would say the relationship is a ten and i don't blame them i blame as i said i blame our past leaders for allowing this to happen there was no reason this should happen there's no reason that we should have big trade deficits with virtually every country in the world i'm going long beyond the g7 there's no reason for this it's the fault of the people that preceded me and i'm not just saying president obama i'm going back a long way you can go back 50 years frankly it just got worse and worse and worse you know we used to be a nation that was unbelievably cash flow oriented had no debt of any consequence and they built the highway system we built the intern you know the interstate system out of virtually out of cash flow and it was it was a lot different now we have a very good relationship and i don't blame these people but i will blame them if they don't act smart and do what they have to do because they have no choice i'll be honest with you they have no choice they're either going to make the trades fair because our farmers have been hurt you look at our farmers for 15 years the graft has gone just like this down our farmers have been hurt our workers have been hurt our companies have moved out and moved to mexico and other countries including canada now we're going to fix that situation and if it's not fixed we're not going to deal with these countries but the relationship that i've had is great so you could tell that to your fake friends at cnn the relationship that i've had with uh the people the leaders of these countries has been i would really rate it on a scale of zero to 10 i would rate it a 10. that doesn't mean i agree with what they're doing and they know very well that i don't so we're negotiating very hard tariffs and barriers as an example the european union is brutal to the united states they don't and they understand that they know they when i'm telling them they're smiling at me you know it's like the gig is up it's like the gig is up they're not trying to there's nothing they can say they can't believe they got away with it canada can't believe it got away with it mexico we have a hundred billion dollar trade deficit with mexico that doesn't include all the drugs that are pouring in because we have no wall but we are we started building the walls you know 1.6 billion dollars and i'm going to keep that going but a lot of these countries actually smile at me when i'm talking and the smile is we couldn't believe we got away with it that's the smile so it's gonna change it's gonna change they have no choice if it's not gonna change we're not gonna trade with them okay how about a couple more one more go ahead in the back thanks mr president yes hi going into these talks with kim jong-un do you have a clear objective of what you want to get out of them i have a clear objective but i have to say eliana that it's going to be something that will always be spur of the moment you don't know you know this has not been done before at this level this is a leader who really is an unknown personality people don't know much about him i think that he's going to surprise on the upside very much on the upside we'll see but never been done never been tested many people the world leaders i'm talking about world leaders that have been right next to him have never met him so we're going in with a very positive spirit i think very well prepared i think and and by the way we have worked very well with their people they have many people right now in general our people have been in singapore our people have been working very very well with the representatives of north korea so we're going in with a very positive attitude and i think we're going to come out fine but i've said it many times who knows who knows may not may not work out it's a good chance it won't work out this is probably an even better chance that it will take a period of time it'll be a process well i think the minimum would be relationship you'd start at least a dialogue because you know as a deal person i've done very well with deals what you want to do is start that now i'd like to accomplish more than that but at a minimum i do believe at least we'll have met each other we will have seen each other hopefully we will have liked each other and we'll start that process i would say that would be the minimal and the maximum i think you know the answer to that but i think that will take a little bit of time okay yeah how long do you think it will take you to figure out whether he's serious about uh good question how long will it take i i think within the first minute i'll know how just my touch my field that's what that's what i do how long will it take to figure out whether or not this areas i said maybe in the first minute you know the way they say that you know if you're going to like somebody in the first five seconds you ever hear that one well i think that very quickly i'll know whether or not something good is going to happen i also think i'll know whether or not it will happen fast may not but i think i'll know pretty quickly whether or not in my opinion something positive will happen and if i think it won't happen i'm not going to waste my time i don't want to waste his time yes ma'am are you concerned at all no no no no that's that's only the only the fake news says that you know this look we just got three hostages back we paid nothing they came back to happily ensconced in their homes with their families they're the happiest people in the world right now we uh we have gotten you know we haven't done anything everyone said you know the the haters they say oh you're giving him a meeting give me a break okay this there's nothing uh i think if i didn't do this it would be and it's never been done before you know it's never been done before and obviously what has been done before hasn't worked and this is something i can't stress this strong enough you know i talked about tariffs that previous people and i'm not looking to criticize people that were preceding me but on tariffs it should have never happened well the same thing on north korea we shouldn't be in this position we shouldn't be in this position on tariffs we were hundreds of billions of dollars down to other countries that frankly were never even negotiated with they never even got spoken to i asked a top person in china how did it get so bad he looked at me said nobody ever talked to us they were missing in action our leaders well a very similar thing if you think about it took place with north korea this should not be done now this should have been done five years ago and 10 years ago and 25 years ago you shouldn't be done now have you spoken at all i can't comment on this sir you've got a plan to catch me okay one moment what's up on north korea will you raise the issue of the gulags with kim jong-un we're going to raise every issue and the capital yeah every issue we're sitting here in canada you've attacked the u.s press back home but you've also done it on foreign soil i guess i want i'd like to ask you why you do that because the u.s press is very dishonest much of it not all of it oh i have some folks in your profession that are with the us and the u.s citizens proud citizens they're reporters and these are some of the most outstanding people i know but there are many people in the press that are unbelievably dishonest they don't cover stories the way they're supposed to be they don't even report them in many cases if they're positive so this tremendous um this tremendous i came up with the term fake news it's a lot of fake news but at the same time i have great respect for many of the people in the press thank you all very much i appreciate it thank you
