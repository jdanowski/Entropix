bingo it's one of the most unforgettable moments in football history Cristiano Ronaldo lifting the World Cup for Portugal in 2010 after beating Messi's Argentina wait wait what everyone knows Spain won the 2010 World Cup after beating the Netherlands well everyone except the North Koreans for them the champions in South Africa were Christiano Ronaldo is Portugal thanks for maestro sales but how is this possible alvaro later a flight attendant with tap Portugal visited North Korea last April and revealed this hard to believe story throughout our visit to Pyongyang we had the company of a guide who spoke English he told us that Cristiano Ronaldo is a true idol for many people and that football has a very high importance and popularity across the country what he said afterwards is unbelievable because of their fantastic performance against Brazil losing by only one goal the game vs Portugal was broadcast live in North Korea it was the first time this had ever happened but the game turned sour and Portugal scored four goals very quickly embarrassed the government cut the broadcast but not only did North Koreans miss Portugal's three other goals they missed the rest of the competition they were led to believe Portugal had won it it makes sense if you're gonna be humiliated at least get trashed by the world champions this would be unbelievable anywhere else in the world but we're talking about North Korea here little is known about the enigmatic Democratic People's Republic of Korea but the things we do here set the tone did you know that the country's leader once aced eleven holds in one in a round of golf or that he was born under a double rainbow speaking of which they discovered a unicorn layer in 2012 so what's harder to believe Christiano Ronaldo winning the World Cup or actual unicorns this wasn't the first time North Korea changed sport history through a series of propaganda artwork made in the 2000s they tell the story of a glorious nation having won two World Cups themselves and being victorious in every single sport at the Olympics just to boost the nation's sense of nationalistic pride even if we think this is funny the reality is far from it after being eliminated from the 2010 World Cup the entire North Korean squad was publicly shamed and abused over a six-hour period they were forced onto a stage just to be scolded by the sports minister in front of 400 people their coach was accused of betraying their leader and forced to become a builder there were even rumors of footballers being subjected to forced labor and sent to coal mines sadly there's no way of confirming or denying this according to Radio Free Asia all the blame was put on the coach who was sent to the coal mines for 12 to 14 hours per day the sanctions have been even harsher since the coach doesn't even get to choose the team lineup for games anymore the son of the Supreme Leader doesn't North Korea reached the 2010 World Cup through their own efforts drawn against Brazil Portugal and the Ivory Coast they had it rough from the get-go in their debut they managed a respectable 2-1 defeat to Brazil that should be enough for the small footballing nation to consider them heroes maybe one day they will thank you for watching this video if you enjoyed it don't forget to leave us a like and please subscribe to the channel now the voice is yours give us your ideas for new videos in the comments [Music]
