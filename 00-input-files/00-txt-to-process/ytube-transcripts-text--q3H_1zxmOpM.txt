also saying exactly what I want to I'm not limited by being inside want to I'm not limited by being inside the country and the first thing I want the country and the first thing I want to say is that so the first thing I want to say is that so the first thing I want to say is the my expectations with to say is the my expectations with beforehand were that I wouldn't be able beforehand were that I wouldn't be able to really say say much at all to really say say much at all to the camera whatsoever and I'd have to to the camera whatsoever and I'd have to be really careful be really careful kind of photos and videos I was taking kind of photos and videos I was taking while they're asking permission all the while they're asking permission all the time and trying to find out what I can time and trying to find out what I can and can't film what I can and can't say and can't film what I can and can't say but although I was only there for in but although I was only there for in total you'll see in the next videos I total you'll see in the next videos I was there in total for about about two was there in total for about about two and a half days so I can't fully comment and a half days so I can't fully comment on the whole of North Korea but from on the whole of North Korea but from what I can say about Pyongyang is that I what I can say about Pyongyang is that I was pretty much able to film and say was pretty much able to film and say whatever I wanted as long as it wasn't whatever I wanted as long as it wasn't derogatory to the Supreme Leader's and derogatory to the Supreme Leader's and Kim Jong un camión bill and Kim il-sung Kim Jong un camión bill and Kim il-sung as long as I didn't say anything really as long as I didn't say anything really like bad about them then I could say like bad about them then I could say whatever I want and like I've seen whatever I want and like I've seen videos before saying that they didn't videos before saying that they didn't feel comfortable with what they could feel comfortable with what they could say to the camera like I felt like we say to the camera like I felt like we were looking over their shoulders to see were looking over their shoulders to see like if people were listening to them I like if people were listening to them I don't really feel that that's whoever I don't really feel that that's whoever I felt like quite able to say what I felt like quite able to say what I wanted and be able to film anything wanted and be able to film anything really like the only things you can't really like the only things you can't film while you're there military and film while you're there military and construction the military thing is the construction the military thing is the same in a lot of countries it's not just same in a lot of countries it's not just North Korea and saying things about North Korea and saying things about leaders and kings and stuff is also the leaders and kings and stuff is also the same in other countries as well for same in other countries as well for example Thailand is a country similar to example Thailand is a country similar to that so I felt like I had lost more that so I felt like I had lost more ability to say in film and take photos ability to say in film and take photos then I'd previously thought then I'd previously thought beforehand that being said it is still a
