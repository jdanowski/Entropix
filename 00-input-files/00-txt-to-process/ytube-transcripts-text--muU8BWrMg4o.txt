[Music] for 50 years the demilitarized zone separating north and south korea has been the world's most heavily fortified border some call it the most volatile place on earth [Music] soldiers always on high alert stand ready to respond to any provocation it obviously creates the highest level attention you can have they are not at peace but they're not a war within literally seconds if not minutes this entire place could be elevated to a immediate combat zone tension along the dmz has never been more palpable in april 2003 north korea boasted to the united states that it possessed nuclear weapons it was the latest round in a crisis that had been mounting for months and it confirmed what the us had long alleged today the north korean regime is using its nuclear program to incite fear and seek concessions ignoring united states warnings the north korean government escalated tensions through verbal threats and confrontational actions [Applause] the united states should not attempt to test our military power at the center of the controversy is kim jong-il the north korean leader who today is a mystery to much of the world but inside north korea he rules a people who are taught to revere him in almost god-like fashion what we have in north korea now is a cult almost a religious cult anytime the press is admitted into north korea it's usually for some very carefully choreographed event that's designed to send a message to the outside world and the the message is usually we love our leader the leader is strong when kim jong-il inherited north korea's throne from his father in 1994 many international observers dismissed the sun as an eccentric unqualified for leadership he was called a philanderer he was a womanizer he was a dummy this was more or less the common understanding of kim jong-il but that's not true he's a formidable strategist and he's a formidable power wielder the point is he is the unquestioned leader of north korea he has a million-man army under his direction he has we believe nuclear weapons at his disposal and more importantly he has the unquestioned support of his people [Music] to fully comprehend the crisis an understanding of life inside north korea is required but reliable information is hard to find [Music] by design of its leaders north korea is a country in total isolation i've worked in iraq but iraq is you know like switzerland compared to north korea north korea is probably the most secretive place in the world north korea forbids its citizens to leave the country and keeps them completely cut off from outside information there are no foreign newspapers there are no television programs from foreign nations all the radios are manipulated you only can receive the state propaganda for the few fortunate enough to have access to computers the internet is restricted cell phone coverage is blocked the few foreign journalists allowed in the country are given limited access and are always monitored by government minders we feel constantly watched and people are very anxious about talking to you their bodies freeze up as soon as you come near them and ask a question and you can see intelligence officials sort of working behind interviewees despite the government's best efforts tales of life inside north korea have leaked out in recent years after a deadly famine struck the country in the 1990s a flood of refugees escaped into china some made their way to freedom in south korea after enduring a lifetime of starvation and repression ji hainam fled from north korea in 1998. wouldn't take me months ago the north korean government is only interested in making war not caring for their people it's all useless to me i'm from north korea my ancestors are buried there so you have to understand where i'm coming from for me to denounce this horrible regime jihanam was raised in poverty in hamhung city an eastern industrial town while still in high school she married and gave birth to her only son in the midst of famine her family struggled to survive rations for a student wore 100 grams of rice per day [Music] when i was young i came from a poor family [Music] and when i got married i had to go to a blood bank to sell my blood in order to survive with my family the burdens took a toll on ji and her family heart tears apart remembering the time when my little baby son cried for food i feel dizzy too painful thinking about it [Music] after the starvation began i fought with my husband a lot then i divorced him and he took the child and went with another woman ji's son and former husband moved to another town she never saw them again he lived with a new wife and i think my son had a hard time getting fed by the stepmother the economic stress was tremendous what do you expect i suspect that he's dead by now jihain's story mirrors the suffering of millions of north koreans how has a country so rich in tradition sunk so deep into personal and political misfortune we look for the answers in the testimonies of defectors and the tumultuous history of the most isolated country on earth the first korean kingdom began in 2333 bc over the centuries its rich culture developed many distinctive customs created fine art and literature and refined a unique language and writing system but because of its strategic position korea was a land often under siege from enemies within and without over the course of history it suffered through hundreds of foreign attacks in 1904 the japanese invaded korea and soon claimed it as a colony so our japanese occupation of korea can be characterized as a very brutal rule of the korean people by the japanese despite years of armed guerrilla resistance korea remained under japanese rule until the end of world war ii when japan surrendered in 1945 russian troops occupied the north the united states concerned about soviet domination of the entire peninsula partitioned korea into two occupation zones the korean peninsula was divided along the 38th parallel the stalin soviet union occupied the top half and the americans occupied the bottom half while the seeds of democracy were sprinkled in the south the soviets quickly built the north in stalin's communist mold [Music] in 1948 pyongyang was established as the capital two years later the democratic people's republic of korea was declared the sole political power installed as its first leader was 36 year old kim il-sung at first he was nothing more than a soviet puppet the soviets essentially picked kim il-sung as the leader of the nation and without their help there's a very good possibility he would never have led north korea kim il-sung was born in pyongyang in 1912 to devout christian parents after emigrating to manchuria with his family kim attended a chinese school but his formal education abruptly ended in eighth grade when he was expelled and jailed for joining a communist party organization after his release in 1930 he joined guerrilla armies fighting the japanese military that at the time occupied both manchuria and korea kim developed the reputation of a strong but brutal commander he couldn't trust anybody sometimes he had to get rid of some of the people in that sense he was very ruthless i think some of the traits of this later on you see in north korea and his political purchase in 1941 after the japanese army wiped out guerrilla forces kim il-sung spent five years in russia before being picked by the soviets to return to north korea as its leader he was a very shrewd politician and remained very skilled in being able to outmaneuver his adversaries in domestic politics once firmly in control of the north kim il-sung looked south on june 25th 1950 north korea invaded south korea the goal create a unified communist korea under kim il-sung's rule months into the war china sent 300 000 forces to help north korea a number that would grow to 1 million by war's end the united nations led by u.s forces intervened to assist south korea [Music] the bloody conflict devastated both sides [Music] everything was destroyed by heavy bombing and soul it looked horrible there were pockets of places still intact but most buildings were gone just their columns were standing on july 27 1953 hostilities came to an end with the signing of an armistice between u.n forces north korea and china the armistice formerly recognized the 38th parallel as the division between north and south the border was closed and thousands of korean families separated during the war were forever split in 1952 ha bo naam was a 26 year old movie actress living in seoul that's when she and her brother hassan kik were separated one day he went out to buy something and we didn't hear from him because we didn't hear from him we began to look for him most likely ha was forcibly conscripted into the north korean army that occupied seoul at the time of his disappearance today his sister still yearns to discover his fate i miss him very very much some told us he was dead some said he was still alive so we prayed he was alive our mother passed away because of her grief because she never got to see her son unfortunately since he's the only man in our family on our father's side our bloodline has ended since we women got married so our family will disappear completely like the citizens of north korea would disappear from the rest of the world cut off by a regime obsessed with secrecy and by a leader who saw himself as a god in the wake of the korean war a faction of disgruntled party cadres tried to oust kim il-sung from but just as he did in his gorilla days kim purged his opponents through exile imprisonment and execution in july 1953 he brings this 12 conspirators to a military court and he tried them and sentenced 10 of them to death but political opposition was only one of kim il-sung's problems the korean war left much of the north demolished bombed into oblivion eyewitness reports from the time say that there was barely a village standing pyongyang had been levelled there wasn't much remaining of the infrastructure as you can imagine [Music] kim il-sung implemented an economic and rebuilding plan with the help of the soviet union and china the economy quickly began to turn well they were coming from such a low base that their economy was humming along once they had the infrastructure up and running by the mid-1960s the defining philosophy credited to kim il-sung began to take hold it was called juche or self-reliance today it remains a guiding principle in north korea [Music] the principle of individual thought is that i am responsible for my own fate all my doings and i must explore my future individuality without interruption from others but kim's version of chuche was meant to inspire nationalism and mobilize citizens he crystallized this studio idea of being politically self-reliant and economically self-sustaining and militarily self-supporting self-defending also taught that north korea was the chosen land and was to be led by a great leader [Applause] means man is the master of the universe and that kim was at the center of all human beings in effect juche became the state religion kim il-sung the child of devout christian parents became god i was young i received a strictly regimented education and that is there is only the ideology of kim il-sung and kim jong-il the indoctrination of children continues to this day [Music] [Applause] [Music] it's hard to provide a description of how kim il-sung was able to establish himself as the unchallenged leader of the korean people with the people's support in terms that would be understandable to individuals in the west and this is because the cult of personality which kim il-sung developed surrounding himself after 1956 really was so extensive that it would have made joseph stalin and mao zedong blush proudly showcased as a shrine to kim il-sung and as evidence of north korea's economic turnaround was pyongyang the rebuilt capital became kim il-sung's communist crown jewel what they've done in pyongyang is an example of creating an image of communism as paradise while the rural area is ignored thousands of murals and monuments of kim il-sung were erected goods and services were readily available but access to the capital was a privilege extended only to a chosen few even today citizens need a government-issued permit to enter pyongyang not everybody can be a pyongyang citizen and if you do any minor thing wrong you get kicked out the majority of north koreans are relegated to small towns and villages in the countryside it is the difference between privilege and destitution the rest of the country is entirely regimented you have to work where they tell you to work you have to live where you're assigned to live you can't travel there's no freedom of speech there's no freedom of assembly religious expression is also denied at the time of independence there were many religious practices such as buddhism and catholicism but they got rid of them instead they made the kim il-sung research center or the kim jong-il ideology institute everywhere except for that there is no religion as north koreans learn to adore the great leader they were also taught to hate two despised adversaries we never heard anything about the world we have learned only about kim il-sung and kim jong-il america is bad south korea is bad all we were told was that they were bad starting in the 1960s propaganda films were made and shown to impressionable children [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] if you talk to a north korean they can tell you how basically everything in korean history going way back when is the fault of the united states the view of the korean war from the standpoint of the north koreans is that it was started by the united states in the 1960s kim il-sung's loathing for the u.s and south korea translated into a massive military buildup as part of his war machine kim initiated a program to develop a nuclear weapon in 1965 russia supplied a nuclear reactor to north korea america paid close attention the north korean government in my judgment began its nuclear program for a very simple reason it has to do with the north korean determination to provide for its own self-defense it developed its nuclear program as a central feature of the ideology of juche and self-reliance but the philosophy of self-reliance would not apply to individual citizens especially the hundreds of thousands locked away in north korea's brutal gulag system after three decades in power kim il-sung's venerated status had reached cult-like proportions at the age of 65 kim il-sung began to groom his eldest son as his successor kim jong-il has no particular claims that would justify him being a leader of any particular country except for his birth kim jong-il was born in the soviet far east in 1942 [Music] because his father was often away kim complained that he was forced to grow up alone nonetheless the younger kin grew up loyal to his father when the time came to name a successor kim il-sung chose his only living son his first priority was making sure a family member took over to continue his good work that's the way he saw it and he thought also kim jong-il would try eventually and reunify the peninsula which means making the entire peninsula communist in 1980 38 year old kim jong-il was named party secretariat he became heir apparent he was placed in charge of a number of important responsibilities but not least of which and this is significant he became the chief ideologue for the ideology of juche kim jong-il ordered construction of thousands of buildings and statues lionizing his father [Music] by the early 1980s over 34 000 monuments of kim il-sung adorned pyongyang soon the son's portrait was hung beside his fathers in hospitals schools and homes [Applause] kim jong-il was deified like his father but he was different in many ways many reports painted him as a playboy with a penchant for western culture kim was obsessed with cinema especially american he built elaborate movie studios at his country's expense kim jong-il doesn't have his father's charisma he also doesn't have his father's war record he also seems to have been basically like a spoiled rich kid he liked making movies although kim jong-il acts with bravado he also seems insecure particularly about his appearance as far as his hair is concerned kim jong-il has designated a hair stylist who studies his hair that person thinks only about how to look more authoritative he wasn't born like that there is always someone close by to make him up and he'll look good [Music] to satisfy his reportedly insatiable sexual appetite kim is said to have harems for his personal pleasure these young women are taken from an early age around maybe 16 17 18 from their schools they're specially selected for their looks it's deemed to be a great privilege to serve in one of these pleasure teams and they're taken off to whichever pleasure palace that they happen to be assigned to and they serve kim jong-il's needs although kim jong-il lacks the common man touch of his father he wields the same power to vanish if you don't listen to him he'll cut your throat or send you to political prison because of that everybody has to consider him as god society doesn't need law because he is the law one of those who survived the nightmare of kim jong-il's prison camps is nineteen-year-old kim kyok he escaped from north korea in 2002 after being jailed for three years for the crime of illegally transferring goods he now sketches drawings that vividly depict the horrors he witnessed in his north korean prison [Music] there is a burning scar but that scar if i just keep it inside somehow it gets too painful for me [Music] the real situation of north korean life instead of saying it [Music] drawing it depicts it more realistically when i draw i recall the images of those difficult times [Music] kim's testimony is borne out by the claims of other defectors and human rights workers they reveal nightmarish stories of an elaborate but well-hidden gulag system 27 from the whole territory of north korea are off limits for all the foreigners and all the un organizations are not allowed to go to all these areas and these are exactly those areas where all the concentration camps are located with the exception of a few recent satellite images no photographs or footage of the prisons have ever been found but reports of unjust incarcerations date from the 1950s to today there are basically two different systems of detention the first is the quantity cell which are uh purely political prisons and the second is called the quaso in which you have people who have committed criminal offenses or what would be criminal offenses in a normal society but you also have people who have been charged with what would not be offenses in a normal society both young and old men and women populate the prisons in 1993 ji hainam was 44 years old in coping with the pain of her divorce when she was arrested her crime singing a south korean song she'd heard in a north korean movie to make me feel better my friend invited me to her house i was so depressed and sad that i decided to sing a song called hongdoya the south korean song my fate and my psychological pain were reflected in the verses of the song that's why i sang in front of my friend that night crying and i danced i was reported and they came and got me she was held in acuaso she was routinely tortured at the hands of guards in the security guard's designated bathroom he made me stand there and gag my mouth and threatened me that he was going to kill me if i screamed he tied my hands and stripped my clothes and my underwear and raped me citizens accused of more serious political crimes are shipped without judicial process to quantly so camps forced labor penal colonies where torture starvation and death are commonplace in short they're treated terribly if you don't feed people enough food and force them to do hard labor they succumb to sickness and disease and industrial accidents and die in large numbers han chul was a guard at camp number 22 a typical kwan liso prison he fled north korea in 1994 after his father was labeled as anti-kim jong-il but during his time as a prison guard he routinely abused prisoners when i beat them up i never thought that it was the wrong thing to do it was a natural thing to do when i did that i thought i was doing a good job our instructors taught us not to see them as humans not to see them as a person but to see them as dogs and pigs like animals association is all the state needs to incarcerate citizens not only the individual person who has run afoul of the government for whatever reason but that person's family children grandchildren are also imprisoned for life in these penal labor colonies of the prisoners not forced to hard labor many are required to kneel for hours at a time it's only half hour to one hour that you are allowed to rest that is the break time per day but starting from 7 in the morning until nine pm at night the prison rule is that all day the prisoner must be in the kneeling position [Music] this woman and her husband asked us to conceal their identity out of fear of retribution against relatives still in north korea they were imprisoned on charges of illegally traveling outside the country i felt like i was ready to die but at four in the morning they made us all get in the kneeling position like this for me i had this parathy for condition i couldn't eat for 15 days and i had a very high fever i thought i was dying i couldn't see i couldn't hear and i screamed that i was going to die because food is withheld prisoners would desperately search for ways to relieve their hunger the prison was in this mountainous region there were many things that you could eat off the ground because of that a lot of prisoners were saved rats were the most nutritious thing there there were more rats than anything else some people died of torture some died of starvation and some were frozen to death and then there were deaths due to accidents instead of burying them at the public cemetery the hillside surrounding the prison became the burial site they weren't buried properly when you are near the prison you see numerous burial sites when someone dies no one cares as political prisoners languished in the gulag a plague of suffering and death was soon to befall all of north korea in 1993 north korea announced plans to withdraw from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty which had joined in 1985 pyongyang then removed spent fuel that could be used to manufacture a nuclear weapon from its nuclear reactor at yongbyon the united states took notice in 1994 former president jimmy carter traveled to pyongyang for talks with kim il-sung and a deal was struck north korea has assured us it will not reload its 5 megawatt reactor with new fuel the north agreed to freeze its nuclear program in return the united states would help supply the north with energy by building two light water nuclear reactors that would not produce weapons-grade plutonium was called the agreed framework and that was viewed at the time as a very important step forward and a sign that north korea was that was prepared to uh to open up but then just three weeks after carter left north korea kim il-sung suffered a massive heart attack and died he was eighty-two [Music] foreign [Music] when he died in 94 there was mass grieving in north korea and if you go back and look at the tapes now you can see that a lot of that is very genuine they really are real tears so they did love the man and they viewed him as their salvation despite purges and the infliction of rights abuses on so many citizens perhaps no leader in contemporary history had so indoctrinated his people into such deep adoration for many years individuals diminished the skills of kim il-sung but he was a survivor he ultimately of course created as i said a cult of personality which really was a beyond exaggeration in terms of its power in the north korean people kim jong-il attended his father's funeral but gave no public speeches he was quickly hailed as the dear leader on state radio after a four-year mourning period 56-year-old kim jong-il officially took control of north korea i cut my finger with a knife north koreans know he's different than kim il-sung he even described himself as kim il-sung's devoted son on his father's tombstone that kind of self-promotion without his father's history he cannot survive because people would not support him as a leader [Music] wow he i think inherited from his father genetically the same sort of political savvy which kim il-sung had which allowed him not only to consolidate but to maintain his power and in many respects kim jong-il father-like son is building upon those same skills that he learned from his father [Music] but kim jong-il also inherited an economy spiraling downward in part due to decades of military spending at the expense of infrastructure in part due to the 1991 collapse of the soviet union before the ussr collapsed there was aid coming from them which consisted of about 60 of our food and all of our oil so with the ussr's help we could survive but after their collapse there was no more aid coming from the ussr after that we had a drastic economic collapse massive food and energy shortages compounded the suffering of north koreans especially those outside of pyongyang then in july and august 1995 nature delivered a knockout blow [Music] a devastating deluge hit north korea over 23 inches of rain fell in just 10 days the ensuing flood swept across north korea and scamp harvests were wiped out half a million people were left homeless the infrastructure was destroyed korea was thrust into one of the worst famines in recorded history pine tree park was used as food when you look at the pine trees in the mountains they are all dead because the people skinned off all the bark kids got sick when they ate it hundreds of thousands were dying in towns and villages outside the capital then in 1995 food and energy shortages finally struck pyongyang even the elite suffered all the pyongyang people were starving more than anything there was no heating in the high apartment buildings everyone slept with their coats and socks on and it's true even five-year-old children were found dead frozen kim jong-il was forced to disavow the core premise of north korean self-reliance in august of 1995 he asked the united nations for help they had to bring themselves to admit to the outside world that they were experiencing this this terrible famine they needed aid it must have been a very difficult thing to do because essentially what they'll say to the outside world is our economy isn't working and people are dying so please help us small groups of foreign aid volunteers were allowed in the country one of them was led by german doctor norbert voltson in towns and villages outside the capital he discovered a collapsed health care system unable to provide even basic treatment to famine victims when i first went to the countryside i realized when we were talking about north korea's hospitals or north korean medical system we're talking about nothing there is nothing inside it's only the concrete only the building it's a fake there's no hospital there's no energy there's no heating system there's no running water there's no soap there are no blankets there are no beds there is nothing for the patients inside and there was only the possibility maybe to to release some pain or to help to help them to die because i was too late i saw them virtually dying under my hands [Music] even the flow of humanitarian aid couldn't end the suffering of north korean citizens when jihan was released from her two-year prison ordeal in 1995 she returned to her hometown where she witnessed starving soldiers turn on starving citizens there are secret agents who watch you and they make you watch one another if you say anything just blurting out how hungry you are and wondering when the rations will be given out that alone is criticism for the party they take you away while everybody's asleep and throw you into political prison by 1999 the famine was estimated to have claimed as many as 3 million lives nearly 15 percent of north korea's population of 21 million they are normal children north korean children's hospital look at the faces they do not have any hope anymore no future no no goal they are depressed they are full of fear and they can't smile anymore they can't love anymore in desperate need of food large numbers of starving citizens fled the country unable to cross at south korea's fortified border most escape to the north across the tumon river into china they can swim across the river they can walk across the river if it's frozen they risk being shot or arrested the chinese government considers them illegal migrants and it has a repatriation treaty with north korea so the chinese will arrest these north korean defectors and send them back to north korea where they're likely to go to labor camp or worse but some have made it out safely currently more than 3 000 north korean refugees live in south korea when i came to south korea i realized that human rights means a basic freedom for human life for example one can travel freely at first it was the most amazing thing to me that i could go anywhere without a permit from the authority especially when you travel abroad one can do so freely in north korea you cannot travel abroad unless you escape when i came to south korea i realized that the systemized education i received when i was young was all lies all for the personal glorification of kim jong-il and the kimi's son but kim jong-il and kim song speak as if they care for the people but look at the result people die of starvation and eat each other in 2002 kim jong-il's leadership would be tested as never before not by the catastrophic consequences of famine but by an escalating international crisis over weapons of mass destruction [Music] the agony of life in north korea persists today while international humanitarian aid has lessened the food crisis the country finds itself literally in the dark energy is north korea's biggest problem right now this night satellite photo illustrates the problem the dark area in the center is north korea the brightly lit areas around it are lights emanating from china and south korea there's a massive shortage of gasoline and heating oil they simply don't have the capital to buy gasoline despite economic destitution famine and human rights abuses kim jong-il maintains his tight grip on power when kim il-sung died was widespread speculation in the west about how north korea really its days were numbered it would fall so because kim jong-il all he could basically do was to swill liquor and to womanize and to watch western movies but in the end kim jong-il surprised his critics he consolidated power around himself and there certainly is no question that he is the unchallenged leader of north korea [Music] although there are no signs kim jong-il's reign is near an end internationally his leadership is under growing pressure north korea is a regime arming with missiles and weapons of mass destruction while starving its citizens states like these and their terrorist allies constitute an axis of evil arming to threaten the peace of the world the axis of evil speech during bush's state of the union was was really crucial in in setting the tone for american north korea relations and their deterioration deterioration quickly turned to crisis north korea claimed the united states violated the terms of the 1994 agreed framework by not following through with its promise to help build two light water energy producing nuclear reactors their view is that the united states reneged on the deal that the united states was responsible for the delays many others would say that north korea was dragging its feet and making things very difficult but that is the certainly the spin that the average north korean has the u.s asserts north korea triggered the crisis in october 2002 american diplomats disclosed that north korea admitted in secret talks that it had gone nuclear with a secret weapons program tensions quickly rose in november 2002 the united states cut off fuel oil shipments to north korea in december north korea expelled u.n nuclear inspectors and turned off monitoring equipment at the yangbing nuclear reactor in january 2003 satellite images showed that the reactor had been reactivated it's pretty obvious that pyongyang broke its word and broke the agreement broke a few agreements by indulging in a uranium program and i think that's really the bottom line just days later north korea warned that it reserved the right to unleash a reign of fire against united states forces in the region 38 000 of whom are stationed in south korea [Music] in south korea the question of how to handle the crisis has caused a clash of ideas and generations they regard north korea as a country to be pitied not a country to be feared and that's particularly true of the younger generation these are people in their 20s 30s who have no direct memory of the korean war and they're tired of hearing their you know dads and granddads and grandmothers talk about you know the danger from the communists differences between young and old and the north's brutality notwithstanding in the south there appears to be a common yearning [Applause] [Music] but how for one defector who lost her son in north korea reunification will not heal her wounds i have nothing but tears for the north koreans before reunification comes i'm afraid the north koreans will perish those of us who escaped from north korea all say that kim jong-un must be killed first today as part of the sunshine policy an agreement made in 1998 to ease tensions between the two countries small groups of citizens from both sides of the dmz have been allowed to cross the border to reunite with relatives from whom they've been separated for 50 years in the chaos of the korean war mrs habonam was separated from her brother songik 50 years later she received a phone call from the red cross telling her he was alive and living in the north [Music] i was overwhelmed truly overwhelmed i felt numb at first and then a while later the tears started to come out but i couldn't cry then i wailed saying he's alive then i started calling everybody now i have to meet my brother soon and find out if he got married and had a son so we could continue our family's bloodline right that's what i wish the most in march 2003 mrs ha was given permission to travel to north korea to be reunited with her brother [Music] [Music] how could i not recognize him i'm confident no matter how old we've become our nose and eyes look alike and he has mother's looks for the north korean society i strongly hope something will happen like in germany a peaceful reunification that they can be live in freedom they will have something to eat they are not starving anymore and there are no more concentration camp that will be my hope for the people in north korea which i like very much because they are nice people there are no devils with red horns they are human beings like you and me if there is reunification those separated families can unite [Music] so i dearly wish for reunification that's more than a wish it's a desperate wish people in north korea wish for that as [Music] well [Music] [Music] this [Music] uh [Music] for 50 years the demilitarized zone separating north and south korea has been the world's most heavily fortified border some call it the most volatile place on earth soldiers always on high alert stand ready to respond to any provocation it obviously creates the highest level attention you can have they are not at peace but they're not at war within literally seconds if not minutes this entire place could be elevated to a immediate combat zone tension along the dmz has never been more palpable in april 2003 north korea boasted to the united states that it possessed nuclear weapons it was the latest round in a crisis that had been mounting for months and it confirmed what the u.s had long alleged today the north korean regime is using its nuclear program to incite fear and seek concessions ignoring united states warnings the north korean government escalated tensions through verbal threats and confrontational actions [Applause] at the center of the controversy is kim jong-il the north korean leader who today is a mystery to much of the world but inside north korea he rules a people who are taught to revere him in almost godlike fashion what we have in north korea now is a cult almost a religious cult anytime the press is admitted into north korea it's usually for some very carefully choreographed event that's designed to send a message to the outside world and the the message is usually we love our leader the leader is strong when kim jong-il inherited north korea's throne from his father in 1994 many

kim jong-il but that's not true he's a formidable strategist and he's a formidable power wielder the point is he is the unquestioned leader of north korea he has a million-man army under his direction he has we believe nuclear weapons at his disposal and more importantly he has the unquestioned support of his people [Music] to fully comprehend the crisis an understanding of life inside north korea is required but reliable information is hard to find [Music] by design of its leaders north korea is a country in total isolation i've worked in iraq but iraq is you know like switzerland and by a leader who saw himself as a god in the wake of the korean war a faction of disgruntled party cadres tried to oust kim il-sung from but just as he did in his gorilla days kim purged his opponents through exile imprisonment and execution in july 1953 he brings this 12 conspirators to a military court and he tried them and sentenced 10 of them to death but political opposition was only one of kim il-sung's problems the korean war left much of the north demolished bombed into oblivion eyewitness reports from the time say that there was barely a village standing pyongyang had been leveled there wasn't much remaining of the infrastructure as you can imagine [Music] kim il-sung implemented an economic and rebuilding plan with the help of the soviet union and china the economy quickly began to turn well they were coming from such a low base that their economy was humming along once they had the infrastructure up and running by the mid-1960s the defining philosophy credited to kim il-sung began to take hold it was called juche or self-reliance today it remains a guiding principle in north korea [Music] the principle of individual thought is that i am responsible for my own fate all my doings and i must explore my future individuality without interruption from others but kim's version of juche was meant to inspire nationalism and mobilize citizens [Applause] he crystallized this studio idea of being politically self-reliant and economically self-sustaining and militarily self-supporting self-defending also taught that north korea was the chosen land and was to be led by a great leader [Applause] was at the center of all human beings in effect juche became the state religion kim il-sung the child of devout christian parents became since i was young i received a strictly regimented education and that is there is only the ideology of kim sung and kim jong-il the indoctrination of children continues to this day [Music] [Applause] [Music] compared to north korea and north korea is probably the most secretive place in the world north korea forbids its citizens to leave the country and keeps them completely cut off from outside information there are no foreign newspapers there are no television programs from foreign nations all the radios are manipulated you only can receive the state propaganda for the few fortunate enough to have access to computers the internet is restricted cell phone coverage is blocked the few foreign journalists allowed in the country are given limited access and are always monitored by government minders we feel constantly watched and people are very anxious about talking to you their bodies freeze up as soon as you come near them and ask a question and you can see intelligence officials sort of lurking behind interviewees despite the government's best efforts tales of life inside north korea have leaked out in recent years after a deadly famine struck the country in the 1990s a flood of refugees escaped into china some made their way to freedom in south korea after enduring a lifetime of starvation and repression ji hainam fled from north korea in 1998. it wouldn't take much ago the north korean government is only interested in making war not caring for their people it's all useless to me i'm from north korea my ancestors are buried there so you have to understand where i'm coming from for me to denounce this horrible regime was raised in poverty in hamhung city an eastern industrial town while still in high school she married and gave birth to her only son in the midst of famine her family [Music] [Music] when i was young i came from a poor family [Music] and when i got married i had to go to a blood bank to sell my blood in order to survive with my family the burdens took a toll on ji and her family my heart tears apart remembering the time when my little baby son cried for food i feel dizzy too painful thinking about it [Music] after the starvation began i fought with my husband a lot then i divorced him and he took the child and went with another woman [Music] and i think my son had a hard time getting fed by the stepmother the economic stress was tremendous or purges in 1941 after the japanese army wiped out guerrilla forces kim il-sung spent five years in russia before being picked by the soviets to return to north korea as its leader he was a very shrewd politician and remained very skilled in being able to outmaneuver his adversaries in domestic politics once firmly in control of the north kim on june 25th 1950 north korea invaded south korea the goal create a unified communist korea under kim il-sung's rule months into the war china sent 300 000 forces to help north korea a number that would grow to 1 million by war's end the united nations led by u.s forces intervened to assist south korea [Music] the bloody conflict devastated both sides [Music] everything was destroyed by heavy bombing and soul it looked horrible there were pockets of places still intact but most buildings were gone just their columns were standing on july 27 1953 hostilities came to an end with the signing of an armistice between u.n forces north korea and china the armistice formerly recognized the 38th parallel as the division between north and south the border was closed and thousands of korean families separated during the war were forever split in 1952 ha bonam was a 26 year old movie actress living in seoul that's when she and her brother hassan kik were separated one day he went out to buy something and we didn't hear from him because we didn't hear from him we began to look for him most likely ha was forcibly conscripted into the north korean army that occupied seoul at the time of his disappearance today his sister still yearns to discover his fate [Music] i miss him very very much some told us he was dead some said he was still alive so we prayed he was alive our mother passed away because of her grief because she never got to see her son unfortunately since he's the only man in our family on our father's side our bloodline has ended since we women got married so our family will disappear completely the citizens of north korea would disappear from the rest of the world cut off by a regime obsessed with secrecy what do you expect i suspect that he's dead by now jihainam story mirrors the suffering of millions of north koreans how has a country so rich in tradition sunk so deep into personal and political misfortune we look for the answers in the testimonies of defectors and the tumultuous history of the most isolated country on earth the first korean kingdom began in 2333 bc over the centuries its rich culture developed many distinctive customs created fine art and literature and refined a unique language and writing system but because of its strategic position korea was a land often under siege from enemies within and without over the course of history it suffered through hundreds of foreign attacks in 1904 the japanese invaded korea and soon claimed it as a colony a japanese occupation of korea can be characterized as a very brutal rule of the korean people by the japanese despite years of armed guerrilla resistance korea remained under japanese rule until the end of world war ii when japan surrendered in 1945 russian troops occupied the north the united states concerned about soviet domination of the entire peninsula partitioned korea into two occupation zones the korean peninsula was divided along the 38th parallel the stalin soviet union occupied the top half and the americans occupied the bottom half while the seeds of democracy were sprinkled in the south the soviets quickly built the north in stalin's communist mold [Music] in 1948 pyongyang was established as the capital two years later the democratic people's republic of korea was declared the sole political power installed as its first leader was 36 year old kim il-sung at first he was nothing more than a soviet puppet the soviets essentially picked kim il-sung as the leader of the nation and without their help there's a very good possibility he would never have led north korea was born in pyongyang in 1912 to devout christian parents after emigrating to manchuria with his family kim attended a chinese school but his formal education abruptly ended in eighth grade when he was expelled and jailed for joining a communist party organization after his release in 1930 he joined guerrilla armies fighting the japanese military that at the time occupied both manchuria and korea kim developed the reputation of a strong but brutal commander he couldn't trust anybody sometimes he had to get rid of some of the people in that sense he was very ruthless i think some of the traits of this later on you see in north korea in his political personal and political misfortune we look for the answers in the testimonies of defectors and the tumultuous history of the most isolated country on earth the first korean kingdom began in 2333 bc over the centuries its rich culture developed many distinctive customs created fine art and literature and refined a unique language and writing system but because of its strategic position korea was a land often under siege from enemies within and without over the course of history it suffered through hundreds of foreign attacks in 1904 the japanese invaded korea and soon claimed it as a colony well a japanese occupation of korea can be characterized as say a very brutal rule of the korean people by the japanese despite years of armed guerrilla resistance korea remained under japanese rule until the end of world war ii when japan surrendered in 1945 russian troops occupied the north the united states concerned about soviet domination of the

reputation of a strong but brutal commander he couldn't trust anybody sometimes he had to get rid of some of the people in that sense he was very ruthless i think some of the traits of this later on you see in north korea in his politician despite purges and the infliction of rights abuses on so many citizens perhaps no leader in contemporary history had so indoctrinated his people into such deep adoration for many years individuals diminished the skills of kim il-sung but he was a survivor he ultimately of course created as i've said a cult of personality which really was a beyond exaggeration in terms of its power in the north korean people [Music] kim jong-il attended his father's funeral but gave no public speeches he was quickly hailed as the dear leader on state radio after a four-year mourning period 56-year-old kim jong-il officially took control of north korea many vowed in blood their loyalty to north koreans know he's different than kim il-sung he even described himself as kim il-sung's devoted son on his father's tombstone that kind of self-promotion without his father's history he cannot survive because people would not support him as a leader [Music] [Applause] he i think inherited from his father genetically the same sort of political savvy which kim il-sung had which allowed him not only to consolidate but to maintain his power and in many respects kim jong-il father-like son is building upon those same skills that he learned from his father [Music] but kim jong-il also inherited an economy spiraling downward in part due to decades of military spending at the expense of infrastructure in part due to the 1991 collapse of the soviet union before the ussr collapsed there was aid coming from them which consisted of about 60 percent of our food and all of our oil so with the ussr's help we can survive but after their collapse there was no more aid coming from the ussr after that we had a drastic economic collapse massive food and energy shortages compounded the suffering of north koreans especially those outside of pyongyang then in july and august 1995 nature delivered a knockout blow [Music] his 19 year old kim kyok he escaped from north korea in 2002 after being jailed for three years for the crime of illegally transferring goods he now sketches drawings that vividly depict the horrors he witnessed in his north korean prison [Music] inside me there is a burning scar but that scar if i just keep it inside somehow it gets too painful for me [Music] the real situation of north korean life instead of saying it [Music] drawing it depicts it more realistically when i draw i recall the images of those difficult times kim's testimony is borne out by the claims of other defectors and human rights workers they reveal nightmarish stories of an elaborate but well-hidden gulag system 27 percent from the whole territory of north korea are off limits for all the foreigners and all the un organizations are not allowed to go to all these areas and these are exactly those areas where all the concentration camps are located with the exception of a few recent satellite images no photographs or footage of the prisons have ever been found but reports of unjust incarcerations date from the 1950s to today are basically two different systems of detention the first is the quantly cell which are uh purely political prisons and the second is called the queue hwaso in which you have people who have committed criminal offenses or what would be criminal offenses in a normal society but you also have people who have been charged with what would not be offenses in a normal society both young and old men and women populate the prisons in 1993 ji hainam was 44 years old and coping with the pain of her divorce when she was arrested her crime singing a south korean song she'd heard in a north korean movie to make me feel better my friend invited me to her house i was so depressed and sad that i decided to sing a song called hongdoya the south korean song my fate and my psychological pain were reflected in the verses of the song that's why i sang in front of my friend that night crying and i danced i was reported and they came and got me she was held in a queue was [Music] i was overwhelmed truly overwhelmed i felt numb at first and then a while later the tears started to come out but i couldn't cry then i wailed saying he's alive then i started calling everybody now i have to meet my brother soon and find out if he got married and had a son so we could continue our family's bloodline right that's what i wish the most in march 2003 mrs ha was given permission to travel to north korea to be reunited with her brother [Music] about how could i not recognize him i'm confident no matter how old we've become our nose and eyes look alike and he has mother's looks [Music] for the north korean society i strongly hope something will happen like in germany a peaceful reunification that they can be live in freedom they will have something to eat they are not starving anymore and there are no more concentration camps that will be my hope for the people in north korea which i like very much because they are nice people there are no devils with red horns they are human beings like you and me if there is reunification those separated families can unite [Music] so i dearly wish for reunification that's more than a wish it's a desperate wish people in north korea wish for that as well [Music] [Music] despite years of armed gorilla resistance korea remained

nineteen ninety eight it wouldn't take much then removed spent fuel that could be used to manufacture a nuclear weapon from its nuclear reactor at yongbyon the united states took notice in 1994 former president jimmy carter traveled to pyongyang for talks with kim il-sung and a deal was struck north korea has assured us it will not reload its 5 megawatt reactor with new fuel the north agreed to freeze its nuclear program in return the united states would help supply the north with energy by building two light water nuclear reactors that would not produce weapons-grade plutonium it was called the agreed framework and that was viewed at the time as a very important step forward and a sign that north korea was that was prepared to to open up but then just three weeks after carter left north korea kim il-sung suffered a massive heart attack and died he was eighty-two [Music] foreign when he died in 94 there was mass grieving in north korea and if you go back and look at the tapes now you can see that a lot of that is very genuine they really are real tears so they did love the man and they viewed him as their salvation despite purges and the infliction of rights abuses on so many citizens perhaps no leader in contemporary history had so indoctrinated his people into such deep adoration for many years individuals diminished the skills of kim il-sung but he was a survivor he ultimately of course created as i've said a cult of personality which really was a beyond exaggeration in terms of its power in the north korean people [Music] kim jong-il attended his father's

finger with a knife when kim young died many vowed in blood their loyalty to kim jong-il north koreans know he's different than kim il-sung he even described himself as kim il-sung's devoted son on his father's tombstone that kind of self-promotion without his father's history is to incarcerate citizens not only the individual person who has run afoul of the government for whatever reason but that person's family children grandchildren are also imprisoned for life in these penal labor colonies of the prisoners not forced to hard labor many are required to kneel for hours at a time it's only half hour to one hour that you are allowed to rest that is the break time per day but starting from seven in the morning until nine pm at night the prison rule is that all day the prisoner must be in the kneeling position [Music] [Applause] this woman and her husband asked us to conceal their identity out of fear of retribution against relatives still in north korea they were imprisoned on charges of illegally traveling outside the country i felt like i was ready to die but at four in the morning they made us all get in the kneeling position like this for me i had this para-typhoid condition i couldn't eat for 15 days and i had a very high fever i thought i was dying i couldn't see i couldn't hear and i screamed that i was going to die because food is withheld prisoners would desperately search for ways to relieve their hunger the prison was in this mountainous region there were many things that you could eat off the ground because of that a lot of prisoners were saved rats were the most nutritious thing there there were more rats than anything else some people died of torture some died of starvation and some were frozen to death and then there were deaths due to accidents instead of burying them at the public cemetery the hillside surrounding the prison became the burial site they weren't buried properly when you are near the prison you see numerous burial sites when someone dies no one cares as political prisoners languished in the gulag a plague of suffering and death was soon to befall all of north korea in 1993 north korea announced plans to withdraw from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty which it joined in 1985 pyongyang then removed spent fuel that could be used to manufacture a nuclear weapon from its nuclear reactor at yongbyon the united states took notice in 1994 former president jimmy carter traveled to pyongyang for talks with kim il-sung and a deal was struck north korea has assured us when kim jong-il inherited north korea's throne from his father in 1994 many international observers dismissed the sun as an eccentric unqualified for leadership he was called a philanderer or he was a womanizer he was a dummy this was more or less the common understanding of kim jong-il but that's not true he's a formidable strategist and he's a formidable power wielder the point is he is the unquestioned leader of north korea he has a million-man army under his direction he has we believe nuclear weapons at his disposal and more importantly he has the unquestioned support of his people [Music] to fully comprehend the crisis an understanding of life inside north korea is required but reliable information is hard to find [Music] by design of its leaders north korea is a country in total isolation i've worked in iraq but iraq is you know like switzerland and by a leader who saw himself as a god in the wake of the korean war a faction of disgruntled party cadres tried to oust kim il-sung from power but just as he did in his guerrilla days kim purged his opponents through exile imprisonment and execution in july 1953 he brings these 12 conspirators to a military court and he tried them and sentenced 10 of them

zone separating north and south korea has been the world's most heavily fortified border some call it the most volatile place on earth soldiers always on high alert stand ready to respond to any provocation it obviously creates the highest level attention you can have they are not at peace but they're not at war within literally seconds if not minutes this entire place could be elevated to a immediate combat zone tension along the dmz has never been more palpable in april 2003 north korea boasted to the united states that it possessed nuclear weapons it was the latest round in a crisis that had been mounting for months and it confirmed what the u.s had long alleged today the north korean regime is using its nuclear program to incite fear and seek concessions ignoring united states warnings the north korean government escalated tensions through verbal threats and confrontational actions [Applause] the united states should not attempt to test our military power at the center of the controversy is kim jong-il the north korean leader who today is a mystery to much of the world but inside north korea he rules a people who are taught to revere him in almost god-like fashion what we have in north korea now is a cult almost a religious cult any time the press is admitted into north korea it's usually for some very carefully choreographed event that's designed to send a message to the outside world and the the message is usually we love our leader the leader is strong when kim jong-il inherited north korea's throne from his father in 1994 many international observers

i fought with my husband a lot then i divorced him and he took the child and went with another woman ji's son and former husband moved to another town she never saw them again he lived with a new wife and i think my son had a hard time getting fed by the stepmother the economic stress was tremendous what do you expect i suspect that he's dead by mirrors the suffering of millions of north koreans how has a country so rich in tradition sunk so deep into personal and political misfortune we look for the answers in the testimonies of defectors and the tumultuous history of the most isolated country on earth the first korean kingdom began in 2333 bc over the centuries its rich culture developed many distinctive customs created fine art and literature and refined a unique language and writing system but because of its strategic position korea was a land often under siege from enemies within and without over the course of history it suffered through hundreds of foreign attacks in

occupied the bottom half while the seeds of democracy were sprinkled in the south the soviets quickly built the north in stalin's communist mold [Music] in 1948 pyongyang was established as the capital two years what they've done in pyongyang is an example of creating an image of communism as paradise while the rural area is ignored thousands of murals and monuments of kim il-sung were erected goods and services were readily available but access to the capital was a privilege extended only to a chosen few even today citizens need a government-issued permit to enter pyongyang not everybody can be a pyongyang citizen and if you do any minor thing wrong you get kicked out the majority of north koreans are relegated to small towns and villages in the countryside it is the difference between privilege and destitution the rest of the country is entirely regimented you have to work where they tell you to work you have to live where you're assigned to live you can't travel there's no freedom of speech there's no freedom of assembly religious expression is also denied at the time of independence there were many religious practices such as buddhism and catholicism but they got rid of them instead they made the kim il-sung research center or the kim jong-il ideology institute everywhere except for that there is no religion as north koreans learned to adore the great leader they were also taught to hate two despised adversaries we never heard anything about the world we have learned only about kim zong and kim jong-il america is bad south korea is bad all we were told was that they were bad starting in the 1960s propaganda films were made and shown to impressionable children [Music] foreign [Music] if you talk to a north korean they can tell you have basically everything in korean history going way back when is the fault of the united states the view of the korean war from the standpoint of the north koreans is that it was started by the united states in the 1960s kim il-sung's loathing for the u.s and south korea translated into a massive military buildup as part of his strong when kim jong-il inherited north korea's throne from his father in 1994

information there are no foreign newspapers there are no television programs from foreign nations all the radios are manipulated you only can receive the state propaganda for the few fortunate enough to have access to computers the internet is restricted cell phone coverage is blocked the few foreign journalists allowed in the country are given limited access and are always monitored by government minders we feel constantly watched and people are very anxious about talking to you their bodies freeze up as soon as you come near them and ask a question and you can see intelligence officials sort of lurking behind interviewees despite the government's best efforts tales of life inside north korea have leaked out in recent years after a deadly famine struck the country in the 1990s a flood of refugees escaped into china some made their way to freedom in south korea after enduring a lifetime of starvation and repression ji hainam fled from north korea in 1998. it wouldn't take me months ago the north korean government is only interested in making war not caring for their people it's all useless to me i'm from north korea my ancestors are buried there so you have to understand where i'm coming from for me to denounce this kim jong-il the indoctrination of children continues to this day [Music] [Applause] [Music] is it's hard to provide a description of how kim il-sung was able to establish himself as the unchallenged leader of the korean people with the people's support in terms that would be understandable to individuals in the west and this is because the cult of personality which kim il-sung developed surrounding himself after 1956 really was so extensive that it would have made joseph stalin and matsutomo blush proudly showcased as a shrine to kim il-sung and as evidence of north korea's economic turnaround was pyongyang the rebuild capital became kim il-sung's communist crown jewel what they've done in pyongyang is an example of creating an image of communism as paradise while the rural area is ignored thousands of murals and monuments of kim il-sung were erected goods and services were readily available but access to the capital was a privilege extended only to a chosen few even today citizens need a government-issued permit to enter pyongyang not everybody can be a pyongyang citizen and if you do any minor thing wrong you get kicked out the majority of north koreans are relegated to small towns and villages in the countryside it is the difference between privilege and destitution the rest of the country is entirely regimented you have to work where they tell you to work you have to live where you're assigned to live you can't travel there's no freedom of speech there's no freedom of assembly religious expression is also denied at the time of independence there were many religious practices such as buddhism and catholicism but they got rid of them instead they made the kim il-sung research center or the kim jong-il ideology institute everywhere except for that there is no religion as north koreans learned to adore the great leader they were also taught to hate two despised adversaries we never heard anything about the world we have learned only about kim il-sung and kim jong-il america is bad south korea is bad all we were told was that they were bad starting in the 1960s propaganda
