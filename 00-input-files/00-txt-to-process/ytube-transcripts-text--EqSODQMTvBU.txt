we're here in a North Korean auto dealership and there are a bunch of men and this woman over there who I'm pretty sure are actually just actors and they're pretending to be customers cuz they're not really doing anything they're just sort of checking out the cars or at least pretending to and pertaining to take photos of the cars and not really follow them this is a stop to show us the success of this country you like this car I think I scared them well when we came in there were like two standing at the front counters pretending to talk but there's no one they were talking to no one behind the counter 3m and 3m strips inside of the car seems legit the Wills profession on those back the leopard for the leopard goes for $34,000 us and if you want to get a sedan that looks a little bit more like a Corolla then oops there's no price tag on this one is three but if you want this Jeep here and you're talking $10,000 us not bad the other one we just looked at didn't have AC though doesn't look like this one it has any IC either just as air let's go back and check out our friends over the actors and see what they're up to they just collected a whole bunch of brochures but it's unclear unclear what exactly they're discussing they just been hanging out well this is the auto dealership
