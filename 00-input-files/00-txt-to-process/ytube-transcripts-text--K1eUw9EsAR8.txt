good morning from Pyong sang in North Korea I am at the tourist hotel here in comme sang PM sang is one of the smaller cities north of Pyongyang and being that is not the capital city it's a bit more provincial they're a lot more strict about photography and videography out here and so I'm actually going to stay in my room I actually got into a bit of trouble last night because I was filming a couple of guys in my my tour group who had issues with their bathroom plumbing there their toilet plumbing actually ended up exploding and spurting water everywhere and I started filming it and they weren't very happy with that and told me to stop as soon as I saw that but what I want to share with you right now is our wake-up call if you if you listen behind me there is I'm actually this is this is a view through the the door to my nice concrete balcony and the AC unit that's on my balcony I'm actually staying back here because there's that military truck parked right outside our hotel and it hasn't moved for a while so I don't want to I don't want to push things but you can hear all the propaganda music it'll alternate between this patriotic music and a guy yelling something but I'm sure is about the virtues and goodness and greatness in North Korea but this started up at 5:30 in the morning today and oh let me tell you a best way to wake up in the morning is to some some North Korean propaganda but let me just stop talking for a second and have you sort of enjoy this this music with me I'll stop here I don't know if you can hear now but the guy is yelling again well good morning Pyeongchang
