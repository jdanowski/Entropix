any time anywhere and without preconditions that's washington's latest offer to pyongyang on opening a dialogue over its nuclear program the biden administration's new envoy for north korea was in seoul on monday to push forward efforts to restart the stalled diplomacy the u.s south korea and japan are looking for ways to convince pyongyang to stop developing nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles washington has promised a quote calibrated practical approach and last week leader kim jong-un gave his first reaction to that policy he ordered his officials to prepare for both dialogue and confrontation with the emphasis on the latter here's the us envoy we will earlier today for either cause you know we are still waiting to hear back from our proposal for a meeting and hopefully chairman king's reference to dialogue indicates that we will get a positive response soon joining us is jay wu shin an analyst with the open nuclear network it seems as if the two sides aren't really on the same page at all if the u.s is talking about dialogue and north korea seems more focused on potential conflict that's right the united states and its counterparts in south korea and tokyo is obviously focusing on the dialogue part of the expression that received much attention last week where kim jong-un is reported to have said that the country should prepare for both dialogue and confrontation the expression from last week in itself is not particularly new i would say the the reason why it got a lot of attention is that it's the first time that kim jong-un himself has signaled to the united states that that would be prepared for for dialogue or confrontation following the new administration um but we have we have heard similar things from north korea before in fact yes well i'm wondering how much is pyongyang's lack of interest or eagerness lack of eagerness related to kim jong-un already having had photo ops with america already formerly with uh president trump in singapore and vietnam and also at the dmz so there's no sense of urgency that's right i think that's exactly what north korea is thinking at the moment in fact in may 18 this year we have seen a statement from north korea's first vice foreign minister chisonhi in which she said exactly that north korea wouldn't be giving away opportunities like singapore and hanoi anymore unless there's a change in u.s policy and so far it appears that what north korea has seen so far is not not sufficient for north korea to really come out and to respond to the americans efforts to engage in dialogue now we've reported on covet in north korea and the country has become even more insular during the pandemic it seems to be in a very bad place economically with even some people mentioning of a return to the hardships of the famine decade of the 1990s how much is this a factor in driving pyongyang's foreign policy we first of all we do not believe it to be as bad as in the 90s but certainly it's a very serious situation in fact during last week's meeting explainary meetings in north korea kim jong-un is reported to have put a lot of focus on the dire food situation so that's domestically where the focus lies by the government and um it's it's indeed a factor that could play a role in its foreign foreign relations uh there has not been any any major engagement with uh basically any country in person for for quite some time now and that's this is clearly due to the covet 19 situation jay wushan thank you so much for joining us thank you
