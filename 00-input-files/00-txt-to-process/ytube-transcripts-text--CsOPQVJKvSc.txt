greetings and welcome to North Korea today my name is Kaycee Lartigue and my co-host is yummy part yes and this is a show where we talk about North Korea so the concept is really simple we talk about economics politics culture life and the great thing is that my co-host is from North Korea so she escaped from North Korea in 2007 she made her way across China and into Mongolia and when she got into Mongolia they were captured she and her mother and five others were captured and they were ready to commit suicide instead of going back to North Korea so she made it into South Korea then in 2009 and she's now a rising star and I'm so happy that she's on the show with me okay all right so we are now in Hong Kong we are part of the Atlas experience being hosted by the Atlas network and being co-sponsored by the Lion Rock Institute and I think this is not your first time in Hong Kong yeah it's my second time but I train it's my first time too sitting here you Americans or the ha ha ha with Samara so yeah when you grew up in North Korea Americans were your best friends right oh no you are my one of the enemy and you know when I was young of course everything I learned about how terrible my concern and I learned how to care them and we even made like a snowman and then with hard water and just destroy it just once I can how I grew up and that's how much I hate it for Americans without reason but I cannot believe I'm here sitting with all my enemies here now I know you have a connection with Hong Kong because when you're in North Korea you actually saw some movies yeah I mean I saw the lots of Jackie Chan movies and I saw lots of part of Hong Kong and I heard that Hong Kong is a really international city and I but I would never imagine Hong Kong to be like this wonderful and I couldn't even dream it but it's like a dream for me now I'm sitting in the in dream city dream place mm-hmm yeah one thing about North Korea is that obviously they have blockades against information they have blockades against people leaving the country and they also have blockades against just exchange with other countries but you were able to watch movies when you were there how did that happen because my kids in North Korea now so he started during a great famine time it's 19 right yeah so I should just explain that the public distribution system was run by the North Korean government from from the 1950s until 1994 so PDS public distribution system and they would ration items to the people but that began to collapse during the 1990s and then they had a famine and yes so during that graph framing time and even not great famine time for me to watching that the body is my routine life and that's how many people are dying for food and starving that's why but that therefore people had to survive by themselves and therefore they started the black mark actually it was a and people were just gathering together and trading each other so that they didn't have that many products but they're just selling their like clothes or blankets or and he just coughs for like just get some food and it just getting bigger and bigger and 2002 North Korea government actually officially allowed the market in socialist country so they are all the market and it's all now not black mechanic right but there are restrictions I mean even though they did allow the market there's I know that you told me before about that kind of thing yes so I mean that I saw the lots of movies from market and I saw the like it I thought I bought the DVDs from market and I saw like Titanic like Hollywood movies is my movies Chinese movies and for me first time to see the Titanic it was just unbelievable not because the Capri is a handsome because like for me in North Korea I never seen anything about the our human nature's there are our shimmelfinney's or everything was about the regime and all the press all the newspapers books movies about our leader and the regime country but I saw the first time to see the human stories and I just couldn't believe how come person for time for their loved ones because in North Korea they taught us thank for the regime is the most honorable honorable thing and the love story between men and women is a really shameful story we should not talk about that in public and that I was like wondering how can tape like make a movie for I'll get such a shameful story and I they really okay now so what happened to someone in North Korea who made that kind of oh man it's impossible to make a move for that and if somebody your generation will be killed littering so that's right for me was shocking for me to how can make a movie like history then still they are okay with this so that's why they're for that time I just started to learn about the outside the world and I realized that maybe our country is not our best country in the world or maybe there's something else in outside but yea watching his movies not actually later in North Korea we have to risk a life so when I was nine years old I saw the first publication situation right so she was my best mom's mother and my best friend's mother expense mother and she sold some South Korean movies and some American movies and because of that she got cared in for all of us it was 2002 or 2003 yeah yeah so but lots of people are watching these DVDs because they have no clue and about the outside world this is only the way they can access to outside and bring about the Americans or South Koreans or like Chinese that's why it's kind of a smaller variant for the regime even though they trying to stop this but the curiosity or they are desire for learned the outside world is never going to stop that you said before you were quoted on SBS Australia and saying that you thought that Kim Jong Il could read your mind yeah oh it's kind of embarrassing that how come that's typical a candidate in my mind but I mean when I was North Korea today I learned that how can he make America's why he's so chick-fil-a with us and she's a life is actually everlasting he's never going to time even the kimi o Sun God he's still alive he's like spirit and present and I thought that you are even the item meet Kim Jong or Kim song like physically Bastiat for his presence is everywhere so even though I escaped I still can think about him as a bother leader or by like tears I thought I had to think you know he's good and that's I think how I practiced and I will never think of anything bad about him at all even though I left North Korea later okay do you feel like you're free today oh I mean I did so much thing to be free and I tried so hard but recently North Korea like I mean yesterday right before came here though like Sasuke de Tocqueville called me that I'm in the titleist and he started this actual main and they are saying if you are continuing to go like this you might be cured and I said I'm okay like let me do this work ballet today he told me that I should they started some action for my you know activities and so sorry okay all right okay take a break so that's why all they are trying to control me right now stay in guy left and they still have the power on me so oh I never actually can be free Oh a surgeon so I'll continue to fight for this injustice and I will continue to be alright so we're in North Korea and obviously the regime tried to block things but people have now seen the movies and you're part of what we've described as the black market generation so now in North Korea is a natural transition moment and there's a we could the black market generation actually I rewrote the article on Washington Post and I got so many people's attention so I wrote the article because if the people who want to know about the North Korean issues they have to know about the young generation and these people are going to have a power on their regime interior chain serve their country so you can protect the North Korean protect protect protect yeah predict put oh yeah you can protect North Korea North Korea's future future and so I am a Daughtry point of it so I thought it has all three characteristics first of all they have a very different relationship with the regime so compared to my parents generation we never learn learn we never received any ration or any food from the government and we actually never experienced an equal life under Kim Kimal son or daughter regime so all we experienced was extreme poverty and public education all these hardships hardships so you don't have a we have a very less loyalty to the regime and that we actually don't really involved it have a close relationship the regime especially this is this cat this generation has a very capitalistic and individualistic mind so I mean when I was young of course I learned about the how be our leader was yes and how can he impress us how He loves us every day and my father just hurting me that as long as you know how to count the money and you don't have to learn these things so I was she was actually the party member she was in the high position party but she told me that to learn about the King hour later you have to learn about the money and how to survive in the market and that's how her scratchings they don't have any the rich loyalty or the connection with the regime anymore they are just actually seeing the government as obstacles for their private well I'm sure the question people ask you very often but what's the future of North Korea so you talked about the changes that are going on so maybe you can be very my foolish or maybe but I think North Korea future is very bright because I believe that because my generation when I was in North Korea actually I never heard it never knew the world why the freedom or the human rights word I never knew that concept of freedom being free because I never be free so that's why you was hard for me even now I had to firm it you understand the concept of freedom and human rights but the people in North Korea's young generation they have a very basic desire base to the movies and the like DVDs and VHS Vida or they wanted to have all like it's just your hair time or they wanted to wear jeans or they wanted to be on necklace and this is what young Jerry generation wants but government they are trying to control it so there is no freedom of saying same dance even the clothes and that's right it's not you wanted to be free from that so I think it's basic our desire to be free actually this will bring the big changes in the future so that's why I think window discharging co-op and they when they having the power on the way and they become for your fifties I'm sure not crazy a bit different okay yeah yeah Carmen cannot do this for the people anymore great optimistic no hey I'm so young me I know you've talked about like the future of change in North Korea line with the Millennials generation and the younger people but how do you see it the real are there any prospects for change or revolution from within the country also I mean that's kind of really any very important question for North Korean people and the photo they exchanged but the thing is in North Korea a revolution is not really easy for them because they are so very much and stirred that our parents generation they got the power and the thing is like here we learn about the like French Revolution and all the revolution histories by North Korea we never learned about the actual rebellion for the Ashley power so we don't know the concept of it actually so here people are learning it so that they think of revolutions of course things some power is doing wrong we are gonna fight for them banner screens they will never learn me and they just born and they think some people are equal but some people are more eager than us some you know different levers and no scribsy they have some one classic thing so they are have like different classes for the people and also some people they know about the issues and they learn about totem across and they want to do something but when they do something for it then the regeneration will be care and if I do something like I said like King Dominator burr and my mom my cousin or like 300 people will retire because of me and not many people at you can do it can risk a time machine the sacrifice and so yeah I think I prefer to people to live if they can so just just briefly so America had Martin Luther King jr. he started his activities in 1955 he was killed 13 years later in North Korea he wouldn't have survived 13 days because he started his action Mandela lived to be an old man okay in North Korea he would have been killed he would have just been imprisoned so in North Korea whenever there's any dissent they just kill the people and as she said they have the three seed strategy where you wipe out three generations of people and I just ask for example how crazy if the regime is like maybe there's a newspaper and front page or as our leaders face and somebody like a back page you cannot see they are picked the face actually and then we just by mistake you just like Bernie or something or like make us some like a scratch there and then you be cured because our face is not loyalty to the regime and that is a reason actually are being cared from the regime and that's crazy they are okay you owe me thanks for sharing and I was just want to say you are very beautiful I kept question for you since now I'm here too by the way question players so so now you were you've got out and you you knew a lot of about at North Korea and you got the brilliant way of speaking English and you can spread the world to the world to the world so what's your plan I mean for the future we were even Abby stay in in South Korea or would you go live somewhere else or did you have a plan when you first got out thanks for me actually my parents really against that I'm doing here and she's like you can have a good life you know I have a life just normal life while you're going to go through this kind of crazy thing and you don't have I should have to do it and but like yesterday I was kind of had that temptation that it's too early for me to die because I'm just solid Cheney and I don't want to end of my life like this oh but I'm not sure that we are eco but for me it's very urgent for me to leave South Korea now and I have to leave that country huh and but the thing is usually I have some thought that can I really do this because even though lots of people and these people like interest in this issue and we can all come together for five for this dictatorship but sometimes I feel like people so so careless and it is really good for the rich like people in North Korea or just I'm doing this just for something you know wasting thing but stay I think I remembered all the things that while I have what I go through in North Korea and all my relatives and all my friends are saying North Korea and I have no choice because I really wanted to feel free then I have to let them free first so I'm not sure where I go but I will just do this work I guess until I die yeah okay all right great thank you very much all right you've
