and north korea is completely completely opposite they try to make you brainwashed so you don't know how to think critically in school you can fail at math you can fade like grammar you can fade at all other subjects but the subject you can never never you should never fail in north korea that is the revolution history of our dear leaders [Music] hi everyone welcome back to my channel so today in this video i am going to talk about north korea's education system north korea education system is a foundation of almost everything the regime uh set up the this crazy utopian system that we read in georgia world's book the education system exists to glorify the leader and the system and it supports the existing system and see how they're gonna do this so basically the north korean education is from preschool to end of high school so there's one year of preschool and then four years of elementary school then north korea combines between major school and high school put them into just six years we call middle school after that so total 11 11 years of education after that you go off to get a higher education go to college or whatever that is next 11. so supposedly according to the regime it is a universal free education system but i will go into later whole bunch why is nothing actually completely opposite from free in this system what the regime mainly teaches is a glorifying team family here in in the west in free democracy education purpose is purpose and help the children to think critically critical thinking is number one thing that education tried to achieve in the west and that's why i was so shocked when i came to america and when i went to university they were saying you know we are trying to teach people how to think and we do you know they develop their critical thinking skill i was like what is critical thinking in north korea is completely completely opposite they try to make you brainwashed so you don't know how to think critically it's the obvious way in school we do learn about you know basic math but even in the math how they teach it it has all propaganda materials like this there are four american masters you killed two of them how many american ambassadors you left to care as like not in 10 years old you say two american masters imagine you like killing murdering someone for kids when i came to like when i went to south korea i had to like relearn everything and i had this my math books it was you know you added like two apples and three oranges how many total fruits you got and you started north korea like how many american pastors love to care they teach you conjugation like grammar and math and like one of the conjugations like this you kill the americans you are killing americans you will kill americans that's how the conjugation works and that's the education but in this a lot of subjects they do teachers like you know physics maybe geography but my because i didn't get the education maybe music and maybe modern socialism moderately i took that course too and among all this subject the main thing that you have to learn is the history of our view leaders kimir's song and then his wife kim jong suk and then third is kim jong-il and now i heard they have to learn about kim jong-un so in school you can fail on math you can fade at grammar you can fade at all other subjects but the subject you can never never you should never fail in north korea that is the revolution history of our dear leaders but the vibrant user of your leaders is not like for us to analyze or understand anything none of that it's just forced memorization they teach us this is exactly this this location our dear little kimura song killed this is many america i mean japanese and terrorists that's like a problem they in school they they give us and then we say which year which day american japanese in paris got killed by our year later and you know it's like all everything in school is she tried to make us believe that dear leaders are gods and that we are forever deadly to the grace of their leaders and other thing is that they teach about the rest of the world outside the world and one of them is south korea in north korea they teach us south korea is colonized by american ambassadors and they are very poor the south korean girls get ripped by american soldiers they get south screen kids don't have money enough to go in a school to learn unlike us in north korea and they say you know we have to be a good people we go to south korea and liberate ourselves korean cousins and brothers from american masters that is education and another thing is that another subject i vividly remember was pretty you know it was at the child it was really scary and you know shocking because they you know had this room in school where we had to go and maybe once so wednesday i remember every wednesday we had to bring a very wide clean socks to go this very special room that room had you know photos out the year later who was when he was younger when he was young janitor defeating our enemies and they showed us a lot of posters of american imperialists killing north koreans they were not like actual photos but they were like these posters they're they're like horrifying you know this this american you know monsters came and killing north korean women who was pregnant burning the babies and they were taking our kids out and sewing our neck and it was just something as a child it was terrifying to see it and you know it was actually really made me believe that i was so brief that i was safe because of dear leader and this was the education they gave us about america and in the countryside you know like where i lived other than kenya the education is really just their main goal is keeping us ignorant keeping us not knowing anything in that system but even getting this crappy fake fabricated education it was free the school teachers constantly beating us and they they demanded us to pay things to school it was like this they demanded us to give them a rabbit skin so supposedly gimme some heard one day that north korea has like not 80 percent of mountains and therefore we have a lot of grass and you know rabbits really good for feeding them grass so every student everybody should have rabbits and after you eat the meat you give the skin of the rabbits so they make the you know those rabbit skin to make our soldiers uh you know maybe cook in the winter and of course you cannot like have five seven rabbits and the size the demand is like huge the rabbit in orchards don't even grow that big and and you cannot like make the skins the only way you can buy those are going to black market to buy those rabbit skin but once we buy the rabbit skin and give it to them it becomes a currency these schools are so corrupt and they serve those rabbit skins back to black market and then demand a small block market and then we go by that exact same skin like you know rabbit skin and we fight and then we do paint them again give it to them and they sell them again to the black market make more money that way and the things they want is ridiculous like they ask you to go you know after school in the morning in the afternoon is a labor time it doesn't matter you're nine years old eight years or ten years old everybody have to work after in the morning time morning time you learn about dear leaders afternoon we have to bring the labor clothes and go out they say pick up the glasses and pick up some letters and layers oh pick up some rubber so we're going to trash them anywhere you can go and looking for rubber looking for tiny metal looking for some paper and in the winter time they ask us to bring a firewood to keeping the classroom warm because we don't have any central heating system and then or today you imagine money or to bring home and if you fail to bring those money teachers hit you and then send you back until you bring it to school so the idea of socialism provides like the free education it cannot be enough worse than that so this education system in north korea only does one thing is making us dumber makes us think more not able to comprehend more like complex thoughts and in a way i'm so grateful that my father's i mean not because my father sent to prison so early but because he went to prison unfortunately i wasn't able to afford to go to school but that means i didn't get to learn all those you know but my mom played crap sorry guys to use these words like i asked mom like are you grateful you got all the education like it was all lie like it actually so much work for her to undo her propaganda schooling and for me i was like sponge i didn't give much education so in a way it was so much better for me not learning all those trash than learning it and coming here to you know undo all those propaganda and it was less work for me to do than people who went to school full time and live in north korea way longer thank you guys i hope this was informative and helpful for you to understand north korea deeply and more in a complex way and i look forward to coming back the next subject stay safe bye
