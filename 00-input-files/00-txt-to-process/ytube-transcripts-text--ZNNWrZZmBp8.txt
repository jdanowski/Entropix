soldiers usually become just free farmers free constructions free cleaners they do pretty much every job that kim jong wants to do and do not pay them and do not feed them and to not even dress them therefore we should not forget like literally everyone is a victim in north korean society except kim jong-un [Music] hi everyone welcome to my channel my name is yan mi park i am a north korean defector human rights activist today in this video i am going to talk about the female soldiers of north korea i have talked about the plight of women in north korea in the past in my videos however today in this video i'll be focusing on the female soldiers mainly in 2015 after kim jong-un came into power he made a military service compulsory for both female and mayor mayor as a man they had to serve 10 years in the military and women they have to serve seven years since it just this law new law began in 2015 40 of women aged between 18 to 24 is in the military almost like uh one in two is in in there and serving uh in this military but the conditions is indescribable when women go into this military service the first thing they get is actually losing their skipping their periods there they don't get enough nutrition and rest the humans deserve to function and make our natural things to work it doesn't work but the thing is that it's more heartbreaking thing is that women actually are glad to see that their purity are gone because in the military they don't have sanitary products for them to have periods and therefore they are so glad that you know they are skipping this but the main thing is what the hardest part being a woman and being in the military in north korea is not disease or malnutrition i mean i think yeah actually malnutrition will be the top because you're don't eating you die and a lot of soldiers men and women both they do die from malnutrition but the main thing for women is actually sexual abuse i just hope you see this uh footage actually got out from north korea of this woman being sexually harassed actually in public [Music] and imagine when when there's like uh it's not in public other soldiers are there what this um official men gonna do to these women don't think about how they treat with these women and there's no system to protect these female soldiers they just become sexual toys for these ohio fishers to play with and during this time when women get abused of course the the ones they need to go find to report they are the ones abusing them all of them actually all of them are taking advantage of these female soldiers and now kim made it mandatory for women to go and being raped by this man uh when when these women do not have periods a lot of times so actually pregnancy is not as common as we think because in north korea there is no you know contraception peers or devices and therefore still those few do get pregnant and in those occasions when women get pregnant by this sort of officials women are the ones get uh punished and they they get disgraced by their family and trying to get illegal abortion and they get infection and they die it is so horrible situation but the thing is that in this military though still the main thing that haunts these female soldiers is malnutrition even this uh when like i remember when my mom had a friend and she had two daughters they were older than us and back then actually military going to military for as a woman was not a compulsory however she still wanted to send her daughter and she said to us i remember that oh if i sent my first daughter to military service one less mouth to feed and that was the reason why she was sending her daughter to military because she could not feed her daughter but you know in north korea it's not a wartime when i see these movies during the world war two or the one and they when the soldiers go in the military they say come on safely and in north korea even though there is no where the war happens still parents wonder the same thing can my children come home safely because when they go to military they a lot of them don't make home safely and of course these women are the same thing when they go in in the military that regimes supposedly provide everything for them but they don't it's called under the name of self-reliance literally they use this uh bs ideology called the self-reliance on everything and they tell soldiers like oh you gotta be self-reliant and but however during this time that they demand these soldiers uh become their free labor basically even though their north korea by per capita is a highest density of military officer i mean soldiers in america there are five military soldiers out of thousand people in north korea 47 people out of 1000 population and north korea that's why it's one of the biggest militaries in the world and in this situation uh soldiers usually become just free farmers free constructions free cleaners they do pretty much every job that kingdom wants to do and do not pay them and do not feed them and to not even dress them so these soldiers while doing this such a dangerous construction work building a dam building a bridge building a building and agreements is not even there they just die so easily and they the regime do not even give them white boots or clothes their kids get poked and get injured and when they go to hospital there is a social thing called like a military hospital but when they go there these hospitals do not even have antibiotics and they demand disorders to bring their own drug and also bribe these doctors i mean when you are working and trained and tortured in this military how do they find money and to bring their own drug and when they die there's no compensation for the family they're just a certificate for the family that oh how long your child served in the military and that's it that's all parents get too my aunt also lost her son in the military when he was only 17 years old and and of course there is no no such an idea that there should be any compensation or not not none of that and when these women i think mostly what shocks me is that like i just can't imagine like 40 of the anyone between 18 to 24 is in the military and there is no way out but when they're serving in the military the horses the punishment if these women try to escape and go home and to find some food they get so severely punished and not to imagine escaping entirely from north korea there's no way out for these women and it's a lot of times they require luck and some women in order to find you know one just like one bowl of corn corn starch or something they they just accept all this sexual abuse but even a lot of times these men even don't even give them anything and just like take advantage of them and treat them like um trash i if i i don't know what i like doing this video and i made i didn't make like all of you to think north korea meant horrible and because you know i grew up in a family seeing my father was beating my mom and that was like beginning of my first trauma seeing how many was being on my mom and of course it didn't do anything good to me the fact is though i still have compassion for them and for my father who was being my mom as well is because there was no education for them like people really i mean what shocks me is that when they when i came here they somewhat think people naturally know how to treat different gender or naturally know how to treat animals or human beings all of that it is all through education and that's why like i don't hold north korean men the standard that i would hold somebody who grew up in this free society i hold kim jong-un in a different standard because he was precisely educated in switzerland where he knew how he may supposedly be treated however even though you man you saw in that video harassing this woman looks like animal like i want to kill this guy that man that is also someone's child and never had education on how to treat a woman and also in a lot of ways that's when men young women they get bullied from other peers that like why are you being easy on women and treating them like somebody who deserves some kind of any respect and there's so much there's a bully going on even breathing men's military soldiers therefore we should not forget like literally everyone is a victim in north korean society except kim jong-un and i just hope that you guys don't hate that you know male soldier too much as much as a halo game i think i think also we have to understand that they are living in a different planet their common sense their law is very different than here and this is why i really think that education is important raising awareness is important that you know the same koreans the north and south we are the same people for a thousand years right before the division and look at to korea how became is so different the system can make us that different make us into another humans that's why i think we need to understand the value of the free democratic system that we have and we need to raise the awareness and educate others this is what we becomes when we lose our liberty and speech freedom of speech i'm so grateful that you're here with me to share raise awareness about north koreans and truth and thank you guys for your continued support i look forward to seeing you all next time
