[Music] as we have covered on this program night after night far left ideologies they are infiltrating our educational system from grade school right through college it's getting that bad so bad that even those who have fled from totalitarian regimes seeking freedom in america in search of freedom of thought they're taking notice an actual defector from north korea who attended the ivy league institution known as columbia university is speaking out telling foxnews.com the climate inside colombia reminds her of north korea citing themes like anti-western sentiment collective guilt suffocating political correctness for example during orientation she said she was scolded for saying that she enjoyed the works of acclaimed author jane austen and was told the books are racist along with being subjected to what she saw as nonstop anti-american propaganda here to tell her story is north korea defector yomi park along with fox news contributor uh mike huckabee um mummy i read this story you're you're saying so you grew up and how many years you were in north korea what 20 years and you think the indoctrination in the united states at our ivy league institution colombia is as bad or worse as the propaganda anti-american hate that you heard in north korea so when i was in north korea first thing that i learned was that americans were bastards it was actually the one word at school when i was attending they told me actually there's just math problems saying there are four american bastards you killed two of them then how many american ambassadors left to care and as a child in north korea you have to say two american masters and when i came from a guy like i fell in love with this country this is such a wonderful country i never been accepted more than this country was and as at columbia university literally every professor was saying that you know the problems that we have on today's world is because of white men how they colonize africa they have corazon i mean asia right that's how they mess up everything and they are the one who's who needs to be blamed and i couldn't believe that am i sitting in north korea's classroom or in america actually i couldn't believe why people were hating their own people that much what is your overall thought then when you think of look at america today and you compare it with your life experience which has been horrific sold into sex slavery at one point in your life uh you get to america you're expecting this to be the land of the free the home of the brave and the land of freedom and and you get the exact same propaganda here it's just heartbreaking i i literally sold as a sexual slave and i literally crossed the gobi desert to be free and now i thought i i landed in a country where i can say what i believed and have my you know freedom to think however now i end up in a country i have to constantly censoring my speech because now in the name of a safe place colombia was told i mean told us what we cannot talk about yeah and i am so concerned like if america is not free i think there's no place else's life that is free and i think that's why it's really alarming to me listening my governor to to miss park um you know sometimes when you when you're in the middle of what i call incrementalism step by step you know we now know what cancer culture is woke america is we now know what political political what's politically incorrect and then to hear this it's it it doesn't really shock me but hearing it still shocks me if that makes any sense well it makes a whole lot of sense i'll tell you what would make a lot of sense why don't you and i get her a tour bus and we'll pay for it sean you and me and we will send her to every college campus in america and let this remarkable young woman speak and tell her story and let people know that what they're giving up in this country they're giving away something that they could never get back and i'm so proud of her you have no idea how grateful i am for the courage and the clarity of yomi's story and i just want to tell her there are a lot of us who love america who still believe in freedom and we believe in you and we're grateful that you're here and your message is one that i hope every single american will hear i know some of them won't those people that you were taught to believe were the american bastards well they probably won't care but all of us are not like that we really aren't you should read some of mike's books about southern sayings remember alexander solzhenitsyn i remember the speech i think i believe if my memory serves me right he gave it at uh harvard any and you know here's a guy from former soviet union saying you're getting bad here too and here's what you're doing wrong would you consider this trip this bus trip that governor huckabee's talking about would you consider talking to college campuses although i've got to warn you you probably would be protested and they try to cancel you and shut you down because that happens as a conservative i can tell you every conservative i know lives through that experience would you consider that though so oh yeah i mean my used to be enemy with kim jong-un i mean i have been on the killing list of kim jong-un for many years because i speak spoke out in the west about the suffering of north korean people my three generations of family got punished but now it's ironically enough so many marxists and communists maoist leninists and sending me death threats and this is such a irony that i don't even know how to respond that this is a war that against socialism and communism the fact that i come from north korea and saying you know north korea started as a communist country it began as you know let's make the most equal society in the world now the region made 50 different classes based on your status based on what your great great grandfather did and when i went to colombia that's when i shocked they say because your ancestors owned the slaves that you must be guilty you are privileged because you're white and this is injustice because you can never choose your ancestors you don't choose your your race and people in north korea being punished for you know certain class and in this america the same thing happening right now your your your testimony is powerful you know the bible says the testimony of two men are true uh thank you for your courage omi thank you mike huckabee thank you
