recently on my new epic educational channel called stay curious he published a video where I was comparing the daily lives of people in North and South Korea and I feel like that video turned out quite well and a lot of you guys enjoyed it as well so now making an extended version of that same video where we're comparing not eight differences but sixteen let's go currency North Korea's currency is the North Korean Won they have nine total banknotes that are in increments of 5 10 50 100 200 500 1000 2000 and 5000 won but depictions of everyday workers the national flower soldiers and of course kim ill sung the valley of the North Korean Won isn't as bad as many might think with 1000 won equalling 1 point 11 US dollars or 1 Europe South Korea's currency is also called 1 they have a total of 5 banknotes in 1,000 2,000 5,000 10,000 and 50,000 increments and they depict things such as winter sports nature ancient kings and even a famous artist as of 2020 the South Korean Won is actually valued less than North Korea's with 1000 won equalling 8 US cents or 75 euro cents well I guess if you ever wanted to become a millionaire overnight all you got to do is take flight to South Korea sports just like everywhere else North Koreans love sports football volleyball and basketball are all really popular among the average citizens but North Korea also has a bunch of elite athletes as well they have a total of 56 Olympic medals 16 of which are gold on the world stage North Korea shines in weightlifting gymnastics and judo on the other hand South Koreans are crazy for football and baseball for their biggest contribution to the sports world is Taekwondo which is a form of martial arts that's now practiced all over the world South Korea also has a strong Olympic presence with 337 medals to their name 121 which are gold at the Olympics South Koreans perform best there are three Taekwondo and short-track speedskating I don't know if you saw this but at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang the South Korean government allowed the North Korean athletes to enter South Korea violent MZ and also all of the South Korea North Korean athletes all marched under one flag the unified Korea that was such an emotional woman the airport's North Korea only has one International Airport and it's very small because they only get around 6,000 international tourists per year because of those low numbers the airport is very modest with just one terminal and a couple of coffee shops and stores available to the passengers additionally only two airlines fly in and out of the airport air China and air cargo which is North Korea's one and only airline that's actually the only one star airline in the world due to the very old seats and less than appetizing food on the other hand South Korea's international airport in Seoul is one of the biggest busiest and cleanest airports in the world it has indoor gardens private sleeping rooms various paws an ice-skating rink and even a golf course the airport receives over 50 million passengers every year more than 60 Airlines fly in and out of it Seoul's Airport is so good that it's actually been voted as one of the best airports in the entire world every single year since 2005 travel North Korea is notorious for not letting its citizens out of the country the North Korean passport is one of the rarest official documents in the world and only the most trustworthy and vetted citizens are ever issued passports for things like academic competition sports and government business trips North Koreans can't even travel freely within their own countries they need special permissions to just leave their towns South Koreans however can travel anywhere they like they have the third most powerful passport in the world and permission to travel visa-free or with visa on arrival to 170 countries every year more than 16 million South Koreans leave their country to go explore other places with little care or worry hair and beauty North Koreans are confined to choosing between just 10 haircuts for men and 18 for women when they enter a salon and sporting the hair can not approved by the state can lead to severe punishment makeup is still popular with wealthy women though in Kim jong-un and his wife are now promoting North Korean cosmetics to its citizens in order to stop people from illegally obtaining foreign beauty products but South Koreans absolutely love beauty and playing with their style since they can do whatever they want here die cosmetic surgery's makeup in fashion are all giant businesses in southeast specially with the influence of kpop in fact k-beauty see 13 billion dollar business and growing I just checked that the k-beauty skincare routine is actually 10 steps what no wonder they're making so much money nightly the type of nightlife Westerners are used to isn't possible for North Koreans well there are some beer and karaoke bars in the capital sitting many of them are only accessible to the elite and there are no nightclubs but that of course doesn't mean that North Koreans do not like to let loose one North Korean defector described the makeshift nightclubs many students put together where friends gathered anyhow to dance and listen to illegal foreign music like kpop even though they risk being sent to prison if they were to be caught South Korean nightlife could not be more different they have tons of bars and clubs all over the countries especially in Seoul they have nightlife for everyone from cheap University bars to trendy upscale clubs hotel parties and gay bars there is no shortage of places to choose from for a night out in South Korea ochio legend let's take a very short break here because now I want to tell you a bit more about that new channel I created once again called stay curious the omission of that channel is to create very short fast paced and fun educational videos about the beautiful world we live in and our creating videos about many different countries around the world and we also have a couple about North and South Korea's for example how their militaries compare or the history of North Korea or n facts about Kim Jong un or the history of Seoul or quite a few other so once you're done watching this video please smash the link in description box down below go check out stay curious binge on as many videos as you like and obviously um subscribe to that channel to help us grow baby thank you so much let's get back to the video cars North Korea only has 11 cars per 1000 people but they do have their own car manufacturing company called Pyongyang motors because most people in the country can't afford a car there is little demand for them and North Korea only produces 0.05 percent of what the United States produces in a year South Korea however is home to two of the largest car brands in the world Kia and I not only that South Korea has the sixth largest automotive industry in the world and boasts 475 cars per 1000 people um this is quite the difference compared with North Korea's 11 cars housing just like with jobs all housing in North Korea is assigned by the government since they own all of the land most people are assigned small living spaces in the countryside with no heating or plumbing and the few who are close to the regime get to live in nice apartments in the capital city South Koreans on the other hand can choose where they want to live in most South Koreans choose to live in city apartments so actually has some super decent friend prices for you develop the big city though and in 2020 you can get a 45 square meter furnished apartment for just five hundred forty dollars per month it might not seem too cheap right now but if you actually compare this price with places like Japan or Singapore or Hong Kong it is really affordable holidays believe it or not North Korea has 71 public holidays though most of them commemorate the ruling political party and the Supreme Leader's the most important holidays in North Korea celebrate the birth of the two former leaders Kim il-sung and Kim jong-il by comparison South Korea only has 12 public holidays some holidays like the Lunar New Year even give them three days off but I like North Korea they don't celebrate the lives of individual leaders and instead have holidays such as Independence Day Constitution Day Memorial Day Liberation Day and many others if you ever want to experience some really amazing Korean traditions visit so for the Lunar New Year you won't be the spotted I promise media even though North Korea's Constitution says that its citizens have freedom of speech and press that is very much not the case in practice North Korea's media is tightly controlled and journalists can only speak favorably about the country even a small table can result in a journalist being imprisoned or sentenced to hard labor the state even owns all the TV stations and controls what can be broadcast to the nation in conscious South Korean media is free and open to everyone every citizen has freedom of speech and freedom of press is practice the world has taken notice of South Korean entertainment so much other the first known english-language film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture was 2019 parasite I have to be honest here for a second watching the parasite sometimes gets really difficult and quite emotional but it's definitely a very good movie if you haven't seen it definitely definitely watch it and let me know what you thought in the comments section down below Healthcare North Lee has a pretty terrible healthcare system they claim to a free health care and while that may be true on paper their health care system is not easily accessible to all citizens especially those living in the countryside health care is really only available to the rich in the cities but even their hospitals are still severely lacking as a lot of them operate without heat or electricity and doctors often have to perform surgeries using battery powered flashlights South Koreans also have free universal health care but it's different in that any citizen can access it not just the rich South Korea is home to some of the best medical facilities in the world and their hospitals are very well equipped I've already mentioned this in the shorter version of this video that I made for stay curious but a really curious thing is that one thing you can find in the North but not in the South is this Chinese carrot flavored toothpaste Wow I'd love to try that supermarkets in North Korea supermarkets are almost exclusively found in the capital city Pyongyang we're only the elite members of society live we know very little about the lives of those in the countryside the we can guess that they don't have many if any supermarkets because according to the United Nations 70% of the country's food insecure and many rely on what they can grow or trade on the flipside South Korea has an absolute abundance of supermarkets that are well stocked and full of all kinds of Korean and international products food because of the rampant food insecurity North Korean many families have to live off of kimchi corn rice and cabbage meat is a lot less common in most diets because it's so expensive than North Korea but there are sometimes able to enjoy pork rabbit and seafood beef is pretty much considered a delicacy by many North Koreans because they almost never have the opportunity to eat it unless they're part of the top 1% the same cannot be said about South Korea however because it is a country that loves its meat and it's very affordable many of the most popular South Korean dishes include beef chicken seafood and of course pork yeah I also have to add that there's literally zero vegetarians in South Korea and because of that traveling there for me we're so difficult restaurants restaurants don't exist in the North Korean countryside of course but the elite who live in Pyongyang enjoy a small variety of restaurants from North Korean restaurants with staples like cold noodles and rice with chicken to the Lickety like dog meat and even foreign cuisines like Italian pasta and Japanese sushi which help cater to foreign tourists North Korea even has their own brand of beer when it comes to Russians in South Korea though I don't even know where to start South Koreans often voted as having some of the best food in the world from sheet food stall serving stood for feed and fish cakes to restaurants specializing in barbecued meats raw fish noodles and dumplings there's no shortage of absolutely incredible foods to choose from you only think South Koreans are apparently not too good at is making beer yeah there's actually this really funny story in South Korea where a South Korean man got into quite a bit of trouble when he publicly stated that North Korean beer was better schools all education in North Korea is mandatory until the age of 79 their education system is heavy on censorship and propaganda for example every classroom in the country must have portraits of the two former leaders hanging on the wall and the students are taught to worship them as gods North Korea also has universities but only the rich kids get to go however South Korea's the most educated country in the world with 70 percent of the population having received some form of tertiary education but despite the excellent quality of education the system is hyper competitive and that is a negative impact on many of the students who spend as many as 16 hours a day at school and prep classes the military lives the North Korean government conscripted citizens and many female citizens after they finished high school men have to serve in the military for ten years and women's course 7 the soldiers have to face harsh training conditions than many of them especially the one stationed outside of Panama face severe hunger according to one North Korean defector the soldiers are given either two potatoes for a meal or raw corn and rice as a result most soldiers are malnourished and are shorter on average than their southern counterparts speaking of South Korea they also contribute their cities but life way South Korean soldier looks very very different South Korea keeps their military active because of the constant threat from the north because of that training in the South Korean military's very very intense they even have their new soldiers feel the effects of a chemical attack by having them enter a room filled with painful guests without mass every time I hear about these differences I feel really sad for all the millions of people living in North Korea who just can't really live a free life I really hope that changes sometime in the future do you think it will let me know in the comments section down below also before I end the video I want to ask you once again to smash the link to check out stay curious in the description box down below watch as many videos as you like once again let me know what you think about the channel and help us grow thank you so much see you next
