america brands this the axis of evil [Music] [Applause] this is the million-man north korean [Music] military [Music] if he gives the orders north korean missiles could devastate seoul tokyo and kyoto with nuclear [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] weapons and this is north korea as it has rarely been seen before [Music] south koreans talk business with the north korean elite former implacable enemies are discussing multi-billion dollar investments into this sealed off communist state [Music] this could be the initial budding of revolutionary change why this change now is north korea desperate because of a failed economy poverty and starvation or is north korea deceptive playing for time while becoming a major nuclear power threatening east asia and the world [Music] economy [Music] the demilitarized zone separating south and north korea we approach from the north surprise south korean soldiers monitor our movements i was given unprecedented access from the north korean authorities despite the fact they did restrict my shooting this is not just the separation between one people it's a separation of culture a separation of ideologies a separation of economic systems why does north korea need a million soldiers if it wants peace to build an economy major pak miyag chol answers our question the north korean military rarely talks to western media part of that answer lies in history a sizable american force still remains here more than 50 years after fighting with north korea so this is the place where we had this um armistice talk with the americans during the korean war that war cost millions of lives an armistice signed here split the korean peninsula into the communist north and the capital itself there is still no peace treaty with the united states and north korea still views america as a threat we do not hide the fact that our nation does not have a good standard of living as other nations since the early 20th century and the japanese occupation we know what it means to be occupied [Music] we can never again allow our country to be deprived of its freedom and this is why we are tightening our economic belts to be militarily strong we cannot resist the united states with imaginary military power we have to build up our defense be strong and resist to make their point local officials take visitors to the uss pueblo north korea claims this was an american reconnaissance vessel spying on the country in 1968 north korean naval forces captured the ship these guys heard our secrets day and night the pueblo say the north koreans is a reminder of the need to be on guard against american plans and they monitored our secret communications and passed the information to the united states and that is the uh flag the ship flag the mark and the military uniform [Music] our soldiers boarded the ship in three groups one unit took the bridge they arrested an officer and demanded to know who is the captain at first he denied he was the commander but after they aimed their guns at him he finally admitted he was the captain the crew was freed nearly a year later after the united states issued a letter admitting the ship was on a spy mission we saw how the united states attacked serbia in 1999 we have learned from the american aggression against serbia and iraq if iraq had a powerful military the us would not have been able to wage war against it america's bush initiated a policy against us he branded us as part of the access of evil bush put us on a list of targets to be attacked he wants to attack us with nuclear weapons but we have our nuclear deterrence we do not hide this on the korean peninsula why is there peace and armistice we have the ability to reduce these dangers because we have this power seoul south korea's capital is just 60 vulnerable kilometers from north korea's powerful military impoverished north korea is capable of destroying this economic giant i think first and foremost is security i think north korea has to demobilize a substantial part of its uh military what is it doing with over a million troops in arms when it's in such dire straits economically and politically reduce their troops remove their long-range artillery which threatened seoul start serious arms control discussions with the south i think it has to come clean on nuclear weapons unless it does that it's not going to fundamentally change its relationship with the us or or the rest of the world north korea's founding father kim il-sung launched the korean war he viewed the offensive as an act of liberating the south the american counter-offensive nearly destroyed kim's regime [Applause] kim established a strict communist state [Applause] when kim died in 1994 the reaction was as if a collective father had died [Music] he was known as the great leader he also imprisoned tens of thousands of his people on merely the suspicion of opposing his regime his son general kim jong-il took the reins of power and he is known as the deer leader even though starvation gripped the country kim invested scarce resources to produce plutonium the essential material for nuclear weapons to stop plutonium production the clinton administration promised aid and two light water reactors to north korea the reactors were never built north korea embarked on a secret uranium enrichment project when it was discovered the bush administration cut aid and pressed for economic sanctions but it did not stop north korea from developing nuclear bombs the americans say the north koreans reneged on their agreements the north koreans say the americans reneged on their agreements from the position of analysis who's right who's wrong actually uh i think you know as far as the implementation of the framework is concerned uh north korea did not make many mistakes it i i guess it has kept his promise clinton administration officially confirmed until the last handle of his day that north korea never ever violated the framework itself many american high-ranking officials they would not expect north korea to survive by the target date of 2003. by by that date north korea was to receive you know light water reactors from the united states and so uh north korea you know was really betrayed we have a a a course a strategy to deal with north korea's proliferation of missiles and nuclear weapons many of these issues are undefined at this juncture [Applause] the north korean government is a truly terrible entity it still has its people in shackles literally the conditions in north korea are still terrible pyongyang is a city of facades this was supposed to be the world's tallest building it's only a shell there are no funds to complete construction there are white boulevards but no traffic [Music] few citizens can afford cars [Music] most visitors see victory monuments [Music] this is what they almost never see pyongyang's central hospital it lacks the basics of any modern hospital patients are crowded into rooms with beds sandwiched in wall to wall old film strips serve as bandage covers with unprecedented access we were allowed to meet eye specialist dr tang chol soul when a train exploded in ryeongchong leveling much of the town he was sent to treat patients i had an opportunity to help at the ryong train disaster it was a collective disaster it was very frustrating and i tried to help the hospitals do not have adequate facilities if i had just had some equipment medicines i could have cured them i could have opened their eyes north korea's medicare system has fundamentally collapsed antiquated machines grind intraocular lenses apart from an outdated ultrasound machine there are no computers or digital equipment here the north koreans say this is because the country is economically isolated with sanctions foreign critics claim the disastrous medical situation stems from the disproportional investment made into the military and not into hospitals currently we are stuck in a problem of trade so he goes we cannot train on advanced equipment because of the problem with the system and the sanctions against our country imports cannot come in and we cannot go abroad [Music] scientific skills have advanced but we cannot study advanced american books do not reach us this is our problem one of the most serious ways the koreans feel the sanctions is when it comes to medical care there are not enough hospitals there are not enough facilities and there are not enough medicines to take care of people they blame the united states glaringly absent in the operating theaters are the tools of modern surgery the surgeons do not even have basic sterile gloves for the chief of ophthalmology the reasons for the sanctions is not as important as the results professor rim shows us equipment that should have been junked years ago but it's repackaged and reinvented the medical results are less than satisfactory we have 20 000 patients per year in need of treatment they cannot see they are effectively blind to treat their cataract they need an operation we have to transplant intraocular lenses there are only a few hospitals capable of such an operation including our hospital at the moment we can serve only 5 000 patients that means 15 000 cannot be treated properly we can only provide limited old standard techniques and they cannot see well even after the treatment across the border in south korea doctors who escaped from the north describe a much more frightening picture of the state of medical care in this sole suburb are the offices of bukumaru an information agency focusing on north korea dr song cannot practice medicine in the south she escaped from north korea two years ago song paid nine thousand dollars to chinese smugglers a massive sum of money to be spirited out of north korea if she was caught in china she would have been sent back certainly to prison now she uses the same chinese services to send money back home to her seven-year-old son and sister song risked everything to feed them we will not reveal her true name so as not to expose her family when i see children crying that could be my son crying when i see other mothers like myself cursing or hitting their children i want to tell them not to be so harsh me i did not have drugs to treat children the children died i am a doctor if i cannot treat my patients how can i be a responsible doctor if a doctor cannot conduct even basic treatment then what good is a doctor this is the ideological facade of north korea [Applause] [Music] collective willpower collective [Applause] [Music] are people just being themselves these hotel workers are preparing for a ceremony they poke fun when this manager comes out with his slogans and then someone else forgets his lines [Music] foreign once discovered the camera must go off [Music] north koreans also have fun with enemies in this theatrical spoof a japanese merchant wants to buy an illegal buddha two friends conspire to trick him north korea feels japan robbed the country during the occupation this is a little bit of revenge [Music] [Applause] [Music] but when it comes to discussing culture and arts the rigid rhetoric re-emerges in our country cultural activity and creativity is entertainment it is vital for the spirit especially in these difficult times the united states is using a policy of economic hardship with courage we can overcome this hardship we're in a difficult situation but we can smile [Applause] and with the guidance of the dear leader general kim jong-il we have the optimism to reach a better life seoul has become a magnet for north korean artists frustrated by a lack of opportunity and daring enough to risk the escape to south korea but when they arrive they hit a cultural roadblock kim came here because she had no chance to progress in the north she came from a lower social class far from pyongyang kim has established a troupe of north korean singers and dancers they are rehearsing traditional folk songs [Music] a local politician sponsors their efforts [Music] but in south korea western style music not old folk songs are popular [Music] it was very hard in the first year i had to get used to everything this is a different culture the south korean language is different it is full of foreign words south korea is so advanced here is an interesting example ripped jeans is what people wear people move around with mobile phones they have private cars and each house has a computer all what i saw had been unimaginable for me [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] after i began to live here i had to start learning from the beginning like a child actually a child would know more than i understood i have to remember so much and it's very hard at first it was very hard not to understand now i have gotten used to the fact that i do not understand [Music] 50 years we have been separated and so i suffer from that i will get used to it here at least i [Music] think thousands of school children flocked to mae gong day to see the peasant huts that served as kim il-sung's home during his youth just as american children are taught about the revolution that brought independence these children are taught about conforming to collective will is the source of the sun the great leader kim al-sung rose up like the sun we love to visit here because we worship our allegiance to our great leader education is very important in korea just like in any other country it's considered the future for its citizens at pyongyang medium school they face unusual challenges at this orphanage school the great leader and the deer leader are considered the protectors of orphans [Music] the school is desperate for assistance but there is deception the blame is placed on american economic pressure not on the bankrupt economic policies of the regime in this grade 7 chemistry class there are no labs no computers paper is scarce the quality is poor this is closely related to the students eye problems so i hope we will be provided with good paper even if the paper is provided north korea does not have the resources to deliver the product to the schools we receive assistance from many countries the problem is transportation so what we really need is a 10-ton truck to transport the paper what's most important is that 10-ton truck cooker students were allowed to talk to us as kids without the slogans that's revolutionary for this country i love novels i want to be a famous musician so people will love me my favorite class is literature [Music] [Applause] we also go camping we go to the fields and snap pictures we think of our teachers and principal as our fathers and mothers what can we do just protect our earth protect our earth north koreans are a very proud people so we were taken to a prestigious school for the internet my name is jeff johnson my name is sandy my name's linda my name is sue she's my mommy and she's my wife tomorrow is a holiday we are going on a picnic a grand you have to get up early that's great um please get ready for a picnic tomorrow night bye bye i'm going to have a picnic in italy in italy it's very nice the landscape in italy is very beautiful indeed that's very nice the finest students continue to the pyongyang college for languages this boardroom commemorates a visit from kim il-sung kim sat here the best student is given his chair as a place of honor magon we has received that honor in another rare sign of openness she was allowed to talk to us what's your dream about what you'd like to do in the future well at this stage i can't quite tell you exactly because it's still right in my heart and i have this habit of not telling anybody before i do anything because i want it to be a surprise ma has the wondrous naivete of someone who has not touched the outside world while i've been studying english i've come to learn more about english culture specifically speaking the british and american i've come to learn the culture and traditions they have and when we greet each other we don't normally shake hands with others we just like lower our heads and show our respect to elders and on days like the luna moon that's our festival we put on our traditional tokodis and go to our elders to show our respect to them [Music] i realized that um in america they just like um well their way of saying hellos is just like a friendly wave sometimes and um that is that's a bit different but it does show that they still do care for each other and those kind of things and so um and food food is completely different and well in the matter of culture that's all i can say chai yong sik is a deputy director in the powerful trade ministry as part of the north korean elite he pins hopes on students like magon we to develop the country's future what we are saying by reading your lips by seeing the shapes of your movement of your lips but to compete in the global village students like ma need free exposure to the outside world that issue has not been resolved in this isolated country if you had a chance to meet a 20 year old from canada or america what would you like to tell them and what would you like to discuss with them well um there would be too many things to that i'd like to ask them and too many things that i would like to tell them but i would like to know what kind of life she leads i mean the way they think the views they take on like certain subjects might be different to mine and there would be lots of things that i'd like to tell the person like um about the well what should i say the great um sceneries in our country like mount tektu people from other countries they would they're very interested in our politics our system of politics and um there will be sunk on politics and lots of people are very interested in that in our unique politics which has been created by our great leader and so i would tell them all that they would like to know about that and of course well just make friends with each other so we can widen our relationship throughout the world trade officials like cha yong sik realize that apart from investing into students like ma north korea must also invest into breaking out of its isolation to develop and prosper chad and his colleagues tried to network with foreign businessmen especially executives from powerful south korea when the south koreans visit here they often join in songs of reunification it's a half century old dream once laced with bloodshed it's now personified in unprecedented joint business projects the song means every song means this our nation is one this all people our parents our sister you know this our our family [Applause] recently we have how can say to promote the economic projects between south and north [Music] this is why cha and north korea need investment from affluent south korea this is the north korean countryside folk songs romanticize about the hard work but there's nothing romantic going on in these fields that is why cha only allowed me to film from a passing distance there are hardly no tractors no harvesters it's back breaking work and plowing is still done with oxen the highways in the countryside are virtually empty there are very few trucks available to transport the products to cities and towns [Music] north korea is desperate for food starvation has dropped only because world food organizations have filled the 400 000 ton deficit in rice and grains this is the image north koreans want to portray a powerful collective working force since the inception of the democratic people's republic of korea it has seen itself at the front line of communism backed by the former ussr and mao's china inspired by linen and marx carried forward by kim il-sung but it is collapsing in the changing 21st century the state stores are empty the only source of electric power is a dinosaur generator plant from the soviet union there are no spare parts to keep it going and because of the lack of electricity heavy industry is crippled at night only the tower commemorating kim il-sung's juji philosophy shines his subjects live in relative darkness desperate for help north korea is now allowing the once unthinkable south korean capitalist businesses are building factories just across this imposing border coming a lot of economic companies from south korea and we are built together some joint economic zone on the on straight away on the demarcation line the south korean motor giant hyundai is building 16 factories across the dmz here in kaesong there is hardly a vehicle moving in this city but within a decade 250 000 north koreans could be working in hyundai related industries it would pry open the country a-sun re-emerge as an internationally competitive industrial tourism and cultural city and will play a pivotal role for exchanges and cooperation between the north and south for international business it represents a unique and exciting opportunity while this is the dream this is their nightmare the berlin wall came down powerful east germany almost instantly collapsed if the north korean regime falls apart in a similar fashion then south korea will suddenly have to support 26 million poverty-stricken north koreans it would be a tough economic burden we saw reunification from west and to avoid economic collapse north korea is being forced to open up to the outside world this pyongyang exhibition tries to attract foreign investment the chinese communists survived because they opened the country in this way kim jong-il is trying a similar strategy now north korea cannot change like china it must happen progressively slowly our nation will support this progressive policies go slow however may not work food distribution has collapsed in north korea and so newly sanctioned private markets like tong il are evolving emerging local merchants demand high prices for food and appliances one or two or a score of these little markets do not fundamentally change the picture in north korea i think once north korean people are free to move about anywhere in the country they want to go i think once the north koreans are able to access external markets travel overseas freely speak freely all of those things that we take for granted in democratic societies once we start seeing those changes happen then yes i will agree that fundamental changes are taking place in north korea what i think has been positive about the last 10 years is that steadily and incrementally of course our businessmen our government officials our scholars our newspaper men who have traveled to north korea have i think all of them together have left the mark on how different life can be that's not enough to instill change says kang chol won kang spent almost a decade in north korean prison camps he escaped from the country kangwon south korea to stop economic appeasement of the north and work to topple the regime the political situation in north korea is how to make people bleed we have to help these victims to save them those who advocate a go slow policy and ignore the human rights situation act irresponsibly kang was just as old as these north korean children when he was sent to a prison camp with his family kanged also believed kim il-sung loved children imprisoned in a mountain forest camp kang learned how to hunt anything that moved in order to eat finding food was the only way to survive many died in the camps you only live like animals not human beings you only think about how to get food to find and eat like animals they are not humans animals kang wrote about his ordeal the family was imprisoned simply because they were ethnic korean communists who had emigrated from japan if someone has the will he survives but if not he dies [Music] many north koreans who have fled the country to china were forced back and then imprisoned we have no accurate figures of how many of them are lost in the gulag but we know where these camps are located a lot of people have managed to escape and that is how we know where they are [Music] the arches of reunification embody the north's dream of unifying the korean peninsula it's almost a messianic reunification of [Applause] workers for those who have escaped to the south reunification is the only hope to see families again kim sings songs of loved ones reuniting one day [Music] it would ring well in the north but in the south there are other tunes [Music] seoul university is the premier college in south korea students here look to the west not the north for the latest trans and styles the united states and rock culture is much closer to these students than north korea or pyongyang for gene u reunification is a dream that has died i think in time that these dreams are are no longer what they used to be that people are thinking instead of reunification first north korea has to improve its economic conditions and then they may consider um two governments but one country as a potential better way to handle the situation both south koreans are afraid that if unification occurs the economy will be affected by north korea's economy is the same age as jinu they live only 250 kilometers from each other but they reside in different worlds people feel afraid of things because they don't understand it and if they understand and well as understanding comes from seeing and i'm experiencing and people do not know us very well people are becoming aware of just how um what a terrible situation north korea is in there's no electricity people are starving now black markets are occurring if people come and like um spend some time with us and like get to know our culture more better and get to know our people more better they'll know that we we can be very friendly when people actually meet the language is already so different and the culture is already so different that it would be hard to say that in reality we are still one people if people would just come and like um spend time with us and like exchange our different views and come to an understanding then then i i would say that that would create relationships friendly relationships well just make friends with each other so we can widen our relationships throughout the world friendships understanding it's a different north korean tune but along with those pleasant words there is also nuclear armament and totalitarian rule only time will tell if north korea is slowly opening to the world or is just buying time and aid to ultimately develop into a dominant force in east asia [Music] you
