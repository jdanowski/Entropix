just over there across the river is communist north korea but the distance is insurmountable for south koreans like me it's a land of mystery intrigue and even danger a tragedy of a nation torn apart by different ideologies i take a closer look at the two koreas where the cold war still lives on is but it's something she will never be able to do and that's because her mother is living in north korea while she is here in the south living a life as a singer since her defection in 2013. she's also a youtuber and most of the time she does it alone but today she has her son with her her son who escaped north korea with her one viewer asks her about her mother [Music] [Music] is living in the industrial city of chongqing north korea's third largest city where she also lived with her family until the age of 33. she says she had the privilege in 2001 to sing in front of then leader kim jong-il the father of the current leader kim [Music] jong-un [Music] her mother was also a singer of pipada opera considered as the masterpiece in north korea kanjin lived quite well in north korea until her mother had a breakdown after suffering from cerebral thrombosis it so she went back to check on her mother the same way she fled north korea but this time around she was caught by north korean guards along the border she was interrogated and kept in an underground cell for about 18 days she didn't dare to think about defecting again instead she married and had a son in 2009 three years later her husband died of cancer determined to give a better life for a four-year-old son she decided to again leave she also decided it would be best to give him a sleeping pill water was cold along the yalu river around september 2013 she says she could feel the bitter cold as the water reached her knees and her waist and for a second she says she forgot about her son okay honey [Music] [Music] crossing the river took about 15 minutes or so the hunting says even now it seemed like a lifetime from the border they undertook a 800 kilometer journey across china laos before arriving in thailand where they purposely got caught so that they could get a flight to south korea it's a route taken by many south korean defectors as thigh authorities usually send them to south korea when they're caught finally at the end of 2013 hyung jian henderson landed in south korea today she lives a life here like any other south korean together with a son who is now 12 years old and her south korean husband i asked him what he tells people when they ask him where he's from south korea is [Music] attending radio shows mostly to talk about experiences as a singer in north korea and how different songs are between the two countries although they speak the same language always on her side is her husband kim daewon [Laughter] [Music] foreign he says it wasn't an easy choice to make back then because of the stigma people have about north korean defectors in the south but he too was a musician when he was young and so he says it was music that brought them together but he admits cultural deficits do exist and if the two koreans would be reunited one day cultural differences would be the biggest hurdle more so than the economic gap but [Music] though she's living a happy life in the south she's always thinking of her family back in the north shore [Music] good [Music] has been drawing pictures of what she remembers of her cheesy hometown when she was 9 years old but she's one of the survivors who lived in the village of puchon on the southern island of chiju where soldiers torched homes and killed people in 1949. she remembers how villagers were forced to gather at a schoolyard where people were screened relatives of military members and police on one side all the rest was divided men women and children into groups of 30 and 50 and dragged away including her mother's sister baby brother and herself [Music] these are some of the events that happened across south korea and on jeju island in the name of fighting communism after world war ii ended in 1945. it was supposed to be the beginning of a united korea being liberated after 35 years of japan's colonial rule but instead korea became a victim of the cold war koreans were not happy about this as they wanted to remain as one country and as the south korean government made plans to hold its first election on may 1948 people started to protest among them were jeju islanders and that eventually led to what is referred as the april 3rd uprising historians say about 30 000 people died from the events during the april 3rd uprising about one-tenth of the island's population then now this was a small village with about 22 households but several of the young men who used to live here were killed and within two days from january 4th to the 5th in 1949 this whole village was burned down now this is only one of the lost villages here on jeju island they're just so many of them across this island and it's because the residents either evacuated and never returned or the whole village was burnt down like this one for decades tj residents remained silent about the atrocities that are folded here between 1947 and 1954. now the april 3rd uprising is one of the ugliest times in south korea's modern history and it was only in the year 2000 that the south korean government actually acknowledged it and began official investigation into this incident and in 2006 the government offered an official apology for killing islanders in the name of fighting communism two years later a peace park was established to honor the victims who's been doing research on the jeju events shows me the wall with names of people who died from the village so many of them died on the same day that's the incident he says chichi was seen as an important place by some countries then even in mainland they lost their life because they are sympathized over communism during that those same similar periods of time but jeju is more like strategically considered as a very interesting or important places for us and japan and china so they try to build a new naval base in here they try to build airfield in here so they are worried about this kind of small island became kind of the north korean base so they're subjugated in more harsh way well many say the islanders were innocent victims there are others who say communist forces were rampant there and that the people simply fell for the propaganda and institution of the communists jeju instead there was armed rebellion directed by the current countries they oppose the election now the jedi people are almost indoctrinated there was that was the real independence movement no that's not right the first president of the republic of korea singh marie knew at the time that unification was almost impossible because of the soviet stalin influence on north korea russia was already planning to establish the people's democratic regime in north korea step by step so he decided south korea must be independent country that was the right call today more than 70 years have passed since an armistice temporarily ended the korean conflict and without a peace treaty and the two sides remain as far apart as ever [Music] once every two to three days yuki huang and his son takes the boat out to the river they have become accustomed to the sounds from an artillery firing exercise that occurs often in this province of yanchan close to the border with north korea and the river is not too far away a few minutes drive along the narrow countryside road now this is the hauntang river and it originates from north korea's pyongyang and it flows through charon porchon and yanchan usually it boasts gorgeous emerald water but not when there have been several days of rain yuki hwan's father started fishing here when he was young and many times they went out together like he does now with his own son they were born in south korea but his father was originally from kangit the capital city of chagang in the northwestern part of north korea bordering china me foreign he lived here in the south until he passed away in the early 1980s his son who is now in his 30s grew up learning in schools how bad communists and north korea can be [Music] majority of south koreans believe a united korea will be better in the long term but details of how this could be achieved are very complicated at this small market in the town of kyodong in kangwon province it seems like time has frozen in the 1960s and 70s shops selling traditional snacks vhs video tapes and the barbershop that has been around since 1965. and that's why the 81 year old hangneha enjoys coming here once in a while the town was established by people like kim north koreans from yumbeck in north korea's huangyae province only about three kilometers away from here it was modeled after a similar one in their hometown he first set foot in this town during the korean war in 1952. his whole family managed to flee north korea to escape communism but his mother went back to get some things those few days became months years and now more than seven decades he can see his hometown from here but with no contacts allowed between the two koreas he has no information about his mother and sisters in the north despite its proximity to north korea it's pretty quiet and calm here and once in a while soldiers are seen doing checks along the barbed wires and visitors are surprised how close the two koreas are for foreign many also agree that perhaps they can live separated but at peace but it's easier said than done chagonxing knows too well about the possible threat from north korea as he has been fishing here all his life he was born in north korea but going to the south together with his parents who have now passed away to him south korea is home although he does want to be able to travel freely to the north one day especially since it's so near to his home now but with the majority of north koreans without access to the internet or able to travel freely around the world or even within their own country the two koreas live in two very different worlds the pyongyang is also changing fast taehyung ho was a north korean diplomat in london who defected to south korea in 2016. today he's one of the two north korean defectors who won a seat in south korea's parliament and as a former high-ranking north korean official has been a treasure trove of information on the north north korea is becoming more digital by the day the very first thing north koreans buy with their first overseas paycheck is smartphone even north korean regime uploads its paper rodong shimon online for north koreans to read it while they are overseas when kim jong-un became the leader of north korea following the death of his father many thought the world's longest running communist dynasty would change he was after all a young man who had experienced the outside world spending his teens in switzerland but it turned out to be no different than his grandfather and father freedom of speech and thought is still out of the question in north korea and that's why chan yang jin is so grateful every single day for living here at times she says she wonders what life would have been like for a boy if she had remained in north korea and of her life as a singer [Music] on the other side of the border [Music] the next episode of cna correspondent we traveled to hong kong where my colleague roland lim speaks to hong kongers both young and old following a tumultuous couple of years this as hong kong enters a new transition period of one country two systems rule under communist china i'm limian sook thanks for watching you
