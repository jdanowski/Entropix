so because north korean people cannot afford actual meat or fish we have like learned how to make a meat that tastes like meat but without putting any meat in it and i'm sure it's gonna be big bastard in america for the vegans lastly i would say that i never seen a cookbook in north korea cookbook is all luxury you can have [Music] hi everyone welcome to my channel my name is amy park i am a north korean defector human rights activist today in this video i'm going to talk about something long request subject about what average person in north korea eat a day i'm going to describe a daily meal plan for us and again it's not about all our skins eat this way kim jong obviously he it's feast his favorite food one of the favorite food he likes is like swiss cheese and i never even knew the word cheese in north korea so this is like really mainly telling you helping you to understand what the most average middle class of nourishments eat and some parts when people you know really bottom it too in in north korea we do it three meals like here breakfast lunch and dinner and it was uh we didn't really have a concept of you know eggs for breakfast maybe pancakes for breakfast and lunches for days and dinners for this it is more like whatever we have and when i came to us like they say in the morning we eat serious we eat like toast right the bread you toast them or like a lot of breakfast menus like specialized brunch places that my friends were loving in new york city and they were telling all these brunch places and i never even knew what brunch is there's really no going out culture in north korea most of time like 90 90 of north korean middle class eats at home and at home we our mirrors are very very like similar there's really no distinction between breakfast or dinner we often prefer to eat you know rice with soup that is has a meat in it and then we have several side dishes like kimchi or like like a salted cabbage fermented cabbage and kimchi we eat literally every single meal and a lot of times we have this like salted radish because why i keep saying like almost like fermented or salted is because we don't have the refrigerator to keep food fresh therefore we have to eat a lot of these things that can last in nature without being in the refrigerator so what i remember in north korea is that we were really eating things following the seasons i never seen a cucumber in the winter time that was the main show when i went to china they told me in the like in the middle of winter no nightmare winter i went in in end of march and april and this human trafficker told me that oh in china you can have you know watermelon strawberry cucumber everything why not in the supermarket and in north korea for you to eat the cucumber you gotta like wait until july at least and when i was in china there were literally things that you know the the season the things that you shouldn't be like having in your yard there was in the mart and in north korea therefore in the summer time we eat like fresh things like cucumber pepper and it is a perfect place for vegans because we don't have a lot of like meat or even fish i was living in this landlocked parts where it's heisen so they were like really really fish came in and those were salted so much like this tiny bit of fish is like entire thing is sold otherwise they cannot keep the fish fresh and it takes like weeks and i talked about the transportation in north korea from the fish you know fisher the ocean town to the inside hasan can come like sometimes in two months only way they can keep the fish preserved is like just put them in a sword that is something we really really eat the time when we eat uh no meat or fish were the only like holidays i still vividly remember my father's favorite food was dumbling we make the dumpling dough with a flour and we put them in some tofu and some cut off the cabbage and if you have meat it's really yummy and we couldn't afford the you know whole entire meal my father would send me to the black market to buy 200 grams like you know 51 kilograms very tiny bit of meat from the black market and you know hoarding that meat going home is so precious and i was also afraid that like another homeless people gonna steal it from me i would like hold that uh this tiny bit like 200 grams of pork in my like a heart and just going home with like jumping my chest that i'm gonna you know taste meat and this like still hurts me so much to this day when my father died from colon cancer in china a few days before i was going out to march and buying like you know duck meat and a lot of different meat that because he loved me so much and he couldn't eat it because he had a colon cancer and and that was his last wish that he wanted to eat some meat before he died so in north korea only only on the holidays we can eat like taste 100 grams of pork for like four people in the family and on average days we start with the rice but that's only really tough people most of the rice in north korea we mix it with other things so we put the corn and we put the you know like beans we put meat and a lot of different stuff to make rice because white rice is most expensive thing like grain i would say and then the soup usually has like dry cabbages because only summer time we have this fresh cabbage but in order us to have the soup in the winter what we have to do is we have to dry the cabbage and then in the winter time we make the soup from the dried cabbage like a lot of the water pepper leaves or sweet potato leaves everything is not thrown away those are we all dry them and eat them in the winter so those are a few side dishes and of course as i said kimchi but in those like red peppers are so expensive so the people who are very poor can't even add much seasoning in it it just looks like very white and or like blue cabbage or soaked in the in the sword and then if we have leftover lunch we do the same thing and if we have leftover something we eat in the dinner time and it's very boring there's nothing shocking about what we in north korea there are a lot of times we only have to eat two times a day so the trick is we would make a grain and we put cut the water in the grain then you know it just amplifies the portion like you want to feel the feeling when you're so hungry so we would put a lot of water into some different grains and make almost like a porridge and if you drink lots of water it helps you to eat some kind of hunger that you fear and in the lunch time we wouldn't eat anything and then dinner time we would would eat the same grain and during the day time i would eat like grasshoppers and going to eat flowers or plants to you know ease my stomach from the hunger but if you were eating any grain that means you're really well off in north korea the people who are really poor in the bottom you don't even get to see radish or anything they eat the like roots of of trees or plants and they even eat the months some certain of months you should never eat the muds because if you eat them you're gonna be constipated you can actually die from it when you're hungry you lose your own humanity like you know civilization is only possible when people are being fed when you're hungry you don't like think logically if i eat this mother i'm gonna be in so much pain not able to go to bathroom but people still eat those months and you know literally just eat anything some some people in the concentration camps or even prison camps they try to find anything even in among the human like animals feces if there was like any tiny corn that was left um processed and comes out and that's like what people eat in the bottom but the middle class we do like if you eat two times a day you are considered to be a middle class if you are fabulous yeah you eat three times a day and rice every meal and that is like what kimura promised to north koreans the first king all the time that i will make sure north korean people is going to eat rice and the meat soup every meal that dream hasn't come to true for us most of human human history that we were starving and in the west we've been liberated from this hunger because you know technological innovations and all of that but north koreans are still almost in the middle age that they are in a hundred dollars still like starving most of days uh lastly i would say that i never seen a cookbook in north korea cookbook is all luxury you can have when you can afford to buy those different parts of you know the recipe like where do you find the half of lemon where do you find like three quarters of like garlic where do you find you know like half some whatever the grams will be for like noodle and so many people like keep asking me like oh can you share some recipe of north korean food but i cooked as a child all the time but the thing is i never i just followed the recipes we were just making whatever we had available that day and a lot of times it is just really just simple vegan food that was usually soaked in the salt that could last for a month and really like on the holidays we can eat some like rice cake and you know like tiny bit of meat and some cooking oil and that is like the times when we were the happiest but this is like really how bleak and boring it is i wish my country were like even china there is some flourishing culture of you know different cuisine and food that i could introduce but there's really not much however there's few things that icer missed about north korean cooking which is the food that i ate in in the black market they were made out of tofu and put the rice and pepper sauce i would often say this is like north korean hamburger and that's how common it is it doesn't have any meat in it but we were loving to eat that and lastly it's called fake meat rice so because north korean people cannot afford actual meat or fish we have like learned how to make a meat that tastes like meat but without putting any meat in it and i'm sure this is going to be big faster in america for the vegans i know that like in america is like a lot of vegetarians and veganism are growing so north korea figured that out before you guys there is actually the most common most famous food called the fake meat rice indoor debuff so in here they somehow in the factory putting a lot of sorts of stuff and creates taste of meat and in between we put the rice and we put like very spicy pepper sauce on top of it and these are top my two favorite north korean food that i serve miss so much i hope this wasn't for you know too boring for you that there's not much that we ate there but also you know there is there people are being so creative despite we don't have much things to eat that people try to have fun with the food and you know share love sharing food with other people thank you again for watching this episode and i look forward to seeing you all next time bye
