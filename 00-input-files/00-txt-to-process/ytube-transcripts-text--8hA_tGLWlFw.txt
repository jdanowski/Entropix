on this episode of china unscripted 
after escaping north korea and china   defector young meek park discovered 
communism right here in america welcome to china unscripted i'm chris chappell 
i'm shelley jung and i'm matt guenesta   and joining us today once again is young me 
park she's been on the show before she's a   north korean defector she escaped chyna and 
she's an author yomi it's great to have you back   on the podcast it's so good to see you guys again 
definitely uh so the previous times we've had you   on you know we've talked about you know life 
in north korea and your escape to china and   how horrible that was but i'm curious today 
to talk a little bit about how you transition   from you know like the worst authoritarian 
societies in the planet transition to the   free society of south korea and then later the 
united states i mean what was that process like i mean where do i begin i still do think i'm still like adjusting you know 
every day i'm like shocked by many many different   things so it's definitely a journey for me 
to get there and i don't know if i'm gonna   ever become like american but i'm trying my best   what's a specific thing that shocked you recently 
after living in the west for several years   oh i mean honestly so yesterday i went out with 
my friend to a bar with my north korean girlfriend   right and then yeah a lot of girls were trying 
to make out with us and initially we thought they   were like girlfriends right we are very innocent 
and then later they were trying to kiss i was   like oh no you might have picked the wrong bar 
you and me you know it was that no more barbara   so like in north korea right we don't know the 
concept of gay or lesbian there's no vocabulary   for it are there bars in north korea no this 
is a very different experience yeah the bar   i gotta adjust to but that part i'm still 
i was very flattered this is lovely but we   still you know do not i think she and i wasn't 
fully aware that here how normal that thing was   yeah i i have that same problem too when i go 
to a bar it's just all the girls try to kiss you   yeah and i just have to be like look and this 
is strange for me adjusting to a free society   that's not embarrassing well i can see how that's 
a culture shock because north korea they don't   really teach you about human sexuality um no 
i mean that's the thing like the romantic love   isn't something celebrated in the society it's 
something you know frowned upon like uh even   current generation when people fall in love and 
get married people like market them and they think   that's a very bad thing it had to be set up by 
the party or by parents by neighbors right that   way people meet so i'm sure sherry knows in the 
i'm sure mal time they were not like encouraging   people to date and by talking about love i mean 
i guess you could be united by your revolutionary   love of mao zedong yeah exactly yeah that was 
the reason why you have to be united and become a   joint family that was your goal you need to share 
have babies for now but of course like that or not   i don't know if this is the case in north korea 
but in uh china during the the maoist times it   was like people would still fall in love and 
have premarital sex it just was like something   everybody did but no one talked about uh because 
it was officially frowned upon just kind of like   fairly commonplace wow interesting i mean in 
north korea i mean or yeah is that the case in   north korea or was it he was talking about china 
yeah so yeah yes i mean so now it's changing a lot   but and because they're not in the past like 
when i was even there people were like loyal to   the regime they i sincerely loved you later right 
like i sincerely could have died for him but now   i'm meeting like a lot of current defectors who 
were born in 2000 i don't know how people possibly   be born then but they are so those young kids are 
coming out say you know they don't care just the   only reason they follow the rules is to survive 
because the punishment got a lot heavier to nami   i don't know if you guys follow the news recently 
kim jong-un declared the war against the k-pop   so he said that the worst thing people can 
do is watching k-pop well i mean even a   clock is right twice a day i mean a broken 
claw a broken clock is right twice a day   so yeah yeah i can see that why kim jong-un would 
not like k-pop because i believe that well like   you know if you just look at the history also 
of communism in eastern europe and kind of what   led to a lot of the fall of communism like some 
of it was based in religions like the christian   churches were definitely like a a huge like bed 
of like resistance against communism but also   western culture rock and roll culture 
like this is the 80s 70s and 80s right   so blue jeans rock and roll bruce springsteen 
like these things were considered forbidden   in you know places like romania east germany 
uh the ussr and the like a lot of young people   would secretly listen to them you know they 
got their news uh from the shortwave radio   from like voice of america radio for europe and 
they'd listen to you know secret cassette tapes   of rock and roll because like that kind of 
rebellious like indiv like you know that kind   of energy was a threat to an authoritarian regime 
and it was something they couldn't control so i   can imagine that k-pop i i bet a lot of people in 
north korea right you know when you were there you   were saying you you watched titanic right and 
that changed how you looked at things i'm sure   there are a lot of people now young people like 
secretly watching k-pop or listening to k-pop so   i wouldn't be surprised i mean even in china when 
my parents were young there was a taiwanese singer   named teresa tung and her music was 
banned in china because she was taiwanese   and also she sang a lot of um covers of 
american songs and different things too   and so my parents and like people in their 
generation they would pass around like cassette   tapes like bootleg cassette tapes of her music 
um even though it was forbidden so yeah i can   totally understand the k-pop thing so the thing 
is like china right right now under korean ccp   and even iran or cuba people have access to 
k-pop or like any kind of genre of entertainment   so but then does that lead to revolution 
it doesn't seem like it so that's why   i'm saying like the almost kim jong's fear 
of foreign information is almost paranoia   like there is no guarantee watching k-pop gonna 
start the revolution and demanding your freedom so   do you think that i don't know is it like 
worth of his paranoia i don't know i don't   think i don't know when i listen 
to k-pop i do have an urge to kill uh well i was going to say like you 
know i don't think the soviet union   fell because of of rock and roll or jeans or 
jeans or david hasselhoff even though he should   take some credit for the berlin wall but like like 
but it was a it was a part of it right and i think   what you have is uh the soviet union had um on one 
hand they'd been at this cold war with the us in   this very very expensive weapons build-up against 
the united states so the the regime was uh really   depleted uh in a way that left people increasingly 
unhappy in terms of their uh material lifestyle   and then on top of that you had gorbachev who had 
already been like push had already like suggested   this idea of perestroika in this idea that like 
you know western things you know and glasnost   you know the idea like western things could be 
like okay uh and so like on one hand people were   increasingly miserable as the soviet union was 
depleted uh number two they had access to western   culture uh and i think it was the combination of 
these two things and probably a few other factors   that allowed that to happen but if you look 
at china china's not depleted right china   has a lot of material resources because you 
know american investors are giving it to them   right and so you can have as much you know bts 
k-pop in china as you want that itself is not   gonna cause the regime to fall so i think the 
question for for kim jong-un might be more like   if he feels that his regime is so weak 
and depleted and people are so unhappy   in every other aspect of their lives then like 
anything could be that catalyst right so k-pop   uh or you know titanic or whatever movies 
come out in the last 20 years yeah i mean i   think china is a different situation now than you 
know the soviet union or a lot of things because   of the i mean i think the chinese communist party 
realized after 1989 the tiananmen square massacre   basically is that they had to um control the 
hearts and minds of people a different way   so they started that whole patriotic education 
campaign and they were able to use nationalism   in a way that was very effective so that now a 
lot of chinese people like pride in being chinese   is kind of like caught up with the chinese 
communist party and because they're like matt   said so economically successful um you know most 
people i mean i think there's still like a lot of   kind of dissatisfaction in chinese society 
but it's not like it was in you know eastern   europe when you had the breadlines and you had 
you know western things were a symbol of like   some kind of hope for them and so chinese people 
are now taught that like the chinese communist   party like china under you know socialism 
with chinese characteristics is superior   to the western model so you know and when 
you have like chinese like rich chinese   um you know students come to the west with 
driving their porsches and stuff like that   they don't see america as a place of freedom they 
just kind of see it as not as good as you know   where they came from well so i guess the question 
you and me about north korea would be that   you know for people living in north 
korea now do they feel that their lives   are getting better and that there's hope 
within the north korean system and if so   you know kpop maybe doesn't matter right so so how 
are people in north korea feeling so yeah it's uh   i do talk to people in north korea and also i talk 
to people uh work the the officials got out of   north korea legally with official premier working 
in russia and china i told them very regularly   nobody has a faith in the system including the 
elites not to mention the people in the bottom   the only reason for me is like not understand why 
they are maintaining it even as an elite is that   fear right if they escape then there are three 
generations of their family gonna be executed   and the poor people they want to get out but 
they can't because the border is now shared   with where the country cannot afford electricity 
put this high electrified fences on the border   with the machine guns and that was not 
enough they were burying land mines   on the entire border of north carolina the entire 
country is not there this became a prison camp   so that's the thing nobody has a faith and 
just all they have is fear and that's the   thing like kim jong-un executes way more 
people than anybody and the rates of execution   is going up and up because he just really has 
nothing left to do to do controlling the people   and i don't know like is that maybe fear isn't 
enough to control the people like in the past   they were at least like you know try to pretend 
they were the beloved mother party you know we are   thankful to have them but they don't even pretend 
anymore like if you disagree i'm gonna kill you   you know it's hearing that it's just i always 
think about this guy you interviewed one day   i don't think we ever did anything with the 
interview but you interviewed a guy in new york   who was talking about how much better north korea 
was than the united states where he is an american   guy yeah yeah and how he would much rather 
live in north korea or as he called it the dprk   yeah i actually remember i showed you this this 
clip on my phone a couple years ago and also yummy   could we should we play it yeah let's let's just 
play that clip we're gonna play that clip right   now yeah do you think north korea or america 
is a better place to live certainly the dprk i   mean people don't starve to death in the dprk like 
they do here every day i mean how many people in   in poor parts of the united states have starved to 
death since we started this rally today how many   people have starved to death in appalachia how 
many people have starved death in harlem they're   more homeless people than there are more empty 
houses than homeless people in the united states   so that that's cra have you have you met anyone 
like that in the united states who like just has   this completely i don't know what do you call it 
brainwashed view of like communism in north korea   or not foreign maybe they're delusional they're 
insane they're literally crazy otherwise how   can you so it's not i just met them do you know 
all these people saying i'm a cia spy i'm a liar   i'm a fake blah blah those are the 
people dedicated their life to destroy me   and i mean they were they they come to a lot 
of the the conferences and throw the one of   them through milkshake to the do you remember 
taiyuan who yeah north korean diplomat escape   in oslo when he was attending they knew who he was 
and threw milkshake at him in oslo norway and that   wasn't a north korean guy i think i was like 
around the corner when that happened it wasn't   a north korean guy it was like some norwegian dude 
who's throwing milkshakes on behalf of kim jong-un   yeah that's crazy so but the thing is this kind 
of uh love for north korean leadership is in a way   stronger from the outsiders because for insiders 
we know the oppression we know how hard it is how   brutal the dictatorship is but then when it comes 
to defending the ideology and north korean regime   in a way those guys are actually true believers 
and i don't know how kim jong-un did it it's   gonna be my forever mystery how the heck did they 
do it to these foreigners and made them become   this kind of true believers i mean there's just 
something about kim jong-un he's so attractive   i know was it that um well i mean so when 
people north korean defectors like you come   out and talk about what it's like in north 
korea their response is that you're a cia spy   is that yeah they say i get paid by 
cia i'm lying i'm opportunist and   yeah so that's that's what their narrative 
is and i will i'm the like the puppet of   the western propaganda so that's what 
i am i became a puppet for the western   countries right now it's the worst to you know 
be accused of being a cia puppet and then not   actually get any cia funding am i right chris i 
can relate i can really relate that's the thing   like where is this guy by the way why they never 
call me right i feel they know who i am by now   but they never ever call me yeah it's too bad yeah 
the reputation doesn't quite meet uh the reality   but like so recently you were on um the 
jordan peterson podcast which is a fantastic   interview i recommend it to everyone watching oh 
thank you and i believe during it you said you   said something like uh your time in at uh columbia 
university in new york there were things happening   there that were crazier than north korea yeah so 
so what is what is that like that seems in because   we talk about this guy who thinks north 
korea is great but uh we're like what   is happening in north uh in north colombia 
in the democratic people state of columbia   yeah exactly so i i mean like some people got 
so emotional like why do you compare to north   korea to america but i was actually comparing 
america's extreme left culture to north korea   i was more specified not american in general 
right so that is the first clarification and   i mean where did i even begin so before class 
at columbia i was there for four years every   single class starts with saying your pronouns 
first then your name so imagine if it's like 90   people lecture [ __ ] you hear what their pronouns 
are and they their names are what they're studying   instead of me trying to understand what 
their desires are who they are as a person   i am obsessed to remembering their pronouns so 
i don't become a bigot and become come off as a   person who is not inclusive or tough enough 
think about the mental energy waste right   and these people like gender fluid so they say i'm 
gender fluid so they can say this morning before   the class i feel like a man but now at the end of 
class i i feel like a woman how the heck do i know   that how they feel like at the mood so how do i 
ever like you know predict what they're gonna feel   like at the moment well surely some for somebody 
like you whose english isn't their first language   wasn't there like any kind of like wouldn't they 
have cut you some slack like i know uh like in   chinese he and she it sounds the same and so in 
english i know a lot of chinese people who like   yeah except she makes up he and she all the time 
yeah maybe they're just being very inclusive and   gender fluid but so yeah surely they must have 
like would have cut you some slack right no so   this is the thing i'm in korea the same like 
you know like he or she the same you like me   right you in korea the same but the thing is here 
like not i certainly have to learn how to sing   day in my sentence as a pronoun i'm still not good 
at it and one day they he was me born guy but they   it's too confusing he or they don't need us it's 
ridiculous why are you having a problem with this   it's simple this is why it's crazy oh this 
is not crazy right i'm like so they told me   like why am i not doing it right and almost 
like crying right i mean i think they thought   i was like systemically like oppress them not 
acknowledging who they are and i'm trying my best   so it made me like not wanting to talk to anybody 
after all so some people took issue and got upset   yeah and they told me directly at the end of 
the class and they were so like curing eyes   and it's poor they were so offended anyway so 
i'm like i said this is crazy i still cannot   do this thing in my sentence after four years 
of practicing but this is not the only thing   professor literally sends email before the class 
oh we are going to talk about this this material   this material talks about why colonialism 
white supremacy racism injustice you rape   victim all of that so if this triggers you 
don't do the reading don't even come to class   and in the middle of the class if it triggers you 
just leave the class don't even need to tell me   so that's every warning that professors give you 
but then why the heck do you spend this fortune   and four years of your life go there if you are 
not there to study and searching for the truth   right well for them it's their parents 
money so it's not as much of an issue   but i mean these people and complaining about 
those students alone where like they say we are   getting there to go to university but then when 
they go to university if it triggers them they   don't want to learn about it so then i don't 
understand the point of education first of all   then all these other things right i mean i was 
talking to my professor one day and she was saying   though the fact that you're letting men to hold a 
door is showing them that man is overpowering you   their aggression because they can like uh i mean 
that's the thing that's how extreme they are the   fact that you're holding a door for somebody 
is an oppression for a woman so i would say   no i'm like i'm holding a door for a woman 
like be considered be having a manner right   being thoughtful and then she's like yummy 
you're brainwashed so that's every time i   challenge my professor they just go there you're 
brainwashed that's why you're thinking this way   i mean even north koreans wouldn't do that even 
north koreans wouldn't come up with this narrative   every single thing comes to white men the 
horrible thing the most horrible thing that   destroys the world yeah they were in a way 
hating white men the western civilization   more intensely than north koreans do at this 
point really yes at some point i was thinking   am i in north korea am i in america right well 
irony like i escaped that country now ended   up in this country where i have to intensely 
hate americans right intensely hate everything   about the western democracy that's what they do at 
colombia this is what they're being taught yeah so   that's the thing like the colombia has its course 
studying western civilization of music and art   so every class they say before the class day so 
who has a problem study western civilization music   and everybody raising their hands and 
they're saying is uh because of the western   men right the white guys colonize asia 
and africa they mess up entire humanity   so now they silenced all those talented minority 
women artists now we have to ending up studying   spigots like mozart and bethel then so i was 
thinking well after all this is the west and in   korea when we study korean music we wouldn't say 
that right oh young me you're brainwashed exactly   exactly so i was saying like what i mean this 
west is a part of human history what is like   wrong with the studying part of history right 
and this is the west after all and everyone's   like looking at me i'm like alien to them and all 
they can just come up with oh you're brainwashed   and like i'm like hopeless to them and eventually 
i just had to shut up and so i can pass the class   and graduate right there's no point for me 
to argue with every single one of them who   will never believe me i mean did you ever were 
you ever like hey i grew up in north korea i   was a slave in china let me tell you what 
real problems are did that ever factor in well i tried to share my experience right like 
the actual weight actual oppression actual slavery   that happening in this contemporary world not 
something happened like many hundreds of years ago   but the thing is like for them i mean for them 
it's so weird the oppression they feel so real   they feel like the white men ought to get them in 
any second i think that's the thing it's that was   the thing after four years these people are not 
just pretending to be oppressed they actually   feel oppressed they they feel actually terrified 
because they are brainwashed they think there's   enemy those white men are trying to kill them 
all so that's how i understood like when we   think we are living in the external or 
physical world but we live in our brain   in their brain though they are living in this war 
zone right so that's it was so sad to these kids   like why they have so much they are the best 
generation of entire humanity we've never been   possible like this if you're not grateful 
now nobody should have ever been grateful   this is the best time to be alive especially if 
you are in and like living in new york city in   this 21st century but then they feel like they 
are the most oppressed people in this entire   human history i mean where do we blame that where 
are we going after this really this generation of   people they think they are the victims how did 
how did that happen yeah i know it's crazy you   know i was thinking at columbia university my dad 
went to colombia and i think he started in 1950   and one of the first classes he took as a freshman 
was a class called the accent reduction because he   had a strong brooklyn accent and so the idea at 
the time and this is 1950 so seven years ago that   like if you had too strong of an accent you 
couldn't get a job or fit in so the idea was to   try to help people like get rid of that sort of 
thing and now like imagine a class like that it   would be considered like oppression to try to 
help people get rid of unintelligible accents that is so true yeah that is so true   well so what was this what was this like for you 
like you you escaped north korea you escaped china   finally you're in the free world yeah what 
what's it like to be like like what happened like   like you surely you must be like oh this is 
this is great to be here and then you see this   that must have caused like a big disconnect yeah 
so that is the first time i learned that actually   in life you need a problem real problem because 
not having a problem is a problem and these people   never had the problems now they're in this right 
i mean they find every single thing to be offended   that's all they're spending their energy on they 
spend entirely their brainpower to be offended and   triggered like even i mean they say oh why can't 
you not pronounce my name like properly right this   they're coming from some absurd country that i've 
never heard of and then demanding that i need to   pronounce their like like the the native speaker 
i mean i don't care when people call them like   yummy or yummy whatever it is right this is 
like they never spoke korean in their life   and i mean why is that a reason you need to be 
offended so now professors i mean demanding you   to send them recording of your own name before 
the class so they study the name instead of   trying their best to teach you how actually to 
think about the problem how to understand history   instead of that they are spending their energy to 
show how inclusive they are by studying your name   with your physical recording of your name and 
this is a place of you know the great thinkers   that supposedly come from where like people 
go to colombia a lot of them gonna become the   leaders of this world and this is the worldview 
this is justice they understand they think this   is justice right this is human rights and 
these people are talking about human rights   like you don't know what human rights violation 
look like actually right you don't know like but they don't believe me they don't so yeah that was the most bizarre and it so 
saddens me one thing i learned is like i'm not   gonna send my son to this like insane schools and 
it makes me not wanting my son to go to any public   school at this point and another thing is like 
i used to be so hopeful about this america right   this is the land of the free the home of the 
brave the future of humanity the background of   hope all these things i believe now i'm like 
oh we are doomed we are really tuned here now   well have you seen this kind of thing outside 
of colombia like i'd like to think america isn't   doomed because colombia university is horrible 
well so i thought so right i literally thought   these kids go to colombia become radicalized 
when they graduate and then they go to like   these companies and paying taxes they're gonna 
come to their senses right by paying taxes   but no i met so many people working for facebook 
twitter all these big tech companies especially   tech companies even like google right i don't 
want to journalize people a lot of them like   98 of them that i met from those companies 
are didn't get over that they are so much   about feeling this oppression they fear 
and they told me why do you go to texas   and i'm like it's a country there are people 
there right america there are people that i   need to reach and they're like they don't want 
to go below a certain line because they think   those are people's trump supporters so they 
don't ever want to set their food on that kind   of territory these are the people in their 40s 
high executives at like these big tech companies   and that's why i was like yeah this they don't 
get over it that was a myth that we i thought   they were getting over but they don't and that's 
why we see so much censorship on youtube i mean   now we are talking we speak profiles now but like 
so much censorship everywhere because these people   actually believe that you need to censor others 
in order to achieve the just they see right the   way they think about it just it by silencing 
others well it sounds so strange to me because   like a lot of these people you're talking 
about this in in like media and tech   that you've spoken to probably were reaching out 
to you because they wanted to help get your story   out there to talk about the kind of oppression 
that happens in the world but then they don't see   that a lot of the things they're promoting 
are also creating injustice and inequality   no they don't connect to that that's how dumb this 
whole thing is right i mean i i spoke a ted like   people go to ted are wonderful they have amazing 
heart right they really want to change the world   but then how they want to change the world is 
censoring individual like liberty right limiting   individual liberty that's but then they learned 
that in their university and school i think all   their life that's how you achieve social justice 
so i don't think in their heart by censoring like   cancer and trump canceling all these people is 
a injustice they are creating they think they   are doing the right thing they truly believe that 
they think they are saving the world by doing that   which is so interesting because a lot of this 
sounds like essentially like marxists or communist   ideology in the united states it sounds like the 
same sorts of things that they were saying uh you   know back in the soviet union at the beginning 
or back in china at the beginning even pol pot   was talking about equality creating equality 
in society and it really seemed that the trick   to that is it seems like it does take advantage of 
the fact that most people are good people and want   to help other people it just then twists it into 
something so devious yeah that is a thing like   i mean in order to start a communism revolution 
if you don't have true believers it's impossible   right so something about this marxism is very 
appealing to good people with good intentions   but how they want to change the world and making 
each other better right how they want to help   others they don't know that that actually brings 
destruction eventually and that's the thing that's   why this ideology never dies is keep trying 
keep trying whenever it brings destruction   it's keep going afterwards and going afterwards 
and not even in america right they're trying   this ideology they are dying to try this thing 
so that we all can be die and starve to death   that's the thing like that's why i keep thinking 
about human nature that humans are not logical   this is fascinating to me right like humans are 
not logical like animals we are not i mean we're   very emotional and i think that's what a lot of 
this kind of preys on like what you're what you're   saying chris about people wanting to be good or 
what you're saying you mean about people really   in their heads and their hearts kind of feeling 
oppressed like it's it's really like very very   emotional and i mean you see that um over and over 
again in communist societies like the cultural   revolution in china it was all like just like i 
mean people look back at that period of time in   their lives and they think like we just all went 
crazy because like it was just a such a time of   like heightened emotion and like kind 
of this like mob frenzy mob justice and   like people kind of like don't even recognize 
themselves when they look back at that because   like it was like the entire society just 
like like went insane for 10 years yeah yeah   it's i think one of the things that's interesting 
is a lot of people you know they're they're seeing   problems in american society and you know they 
they are often real problems uh and what they're   doing is they're saying to themselves well the 
best way to fix this is to give the government   the power to make the arbitrary decisions 
necessary to help this group you know including   help this group at the expense of this other group 
right now obviously there's the problem of like   dividing people into somewhat arbitrary groups 
and you can you know debate about whether race   is an arbitrary group right uh and i think that 
just depends on your world view but the other the   thing that really gets me is it's like let's 
give the federal government lots of power to   make arbitrary decisions power and money but 
it's like did we not just go through four years   of half the country hating the president and 
now we want to give the the government the   like enormous power like what's gonna happen 
you know in four years or eight years when   you know you get republican presidents i don't 
know ron desantis or whatever it is right then   like people are going to be like oh oops maybe we 
shouldn't have given the government all that power   uh and so just like this disconnect between 
wanting to do what's right for people and then   giving enormous power to like this this giant 
uh bureaucracy that can use i mean like you're   giving them tools so like whoever is in power 
is going to use those tools for what they want   to use the tools for and this is what happens 
in uh socialist and communist countries where   you know like full communism is essentially 
the the the government or the party uh   is is so powerful it controls literally every 
aspect of every single person's life right like   north korea like where you know where you live 
what apartment you get uh you know the job you   have the amount of food you have uh the people you 
can talk to you know who you get don't forget the   haircut the haircut i wouldn't mind because what i 
really i've always wanted is a kim jong-un haircut   but like other than that it's very oppressive 
right so so like the more power you give the   government the more oppressive it will inevitably 
be well i think this is why the united states has   always been the enemy of communism abroad 
because the united states everything about   how the united states was founded was created 
in a way to give people as much power and keep   power out of the hands of the government it's 
based on the idea that absolute power corrupts   absolutely and so you have communism with 
its ideology specifically geared towards   uh destroying a society and putting power in the 
hands of a few i mean that's the thing and what i   just keep thinking what i mean in a way right like 
when i have been like never taking responsibility   in north korea because like you said by giving 
all the rights to the government in a way they   promise that you never have to be responsible 
for anything now at the government you're   going to take everything care for you so maybe 
that's why i think it's very appealing to people   in here right now right they just want to 
give every right they have to the government   then which means they don't have to be responsible 
for their behaviors they can be taken care of yeah   because freedom is not easy like it it was 
so hard i remember when i'm in south korea   like freedom was so hard they were saying 
so what are you going to do with your life   and like now do i have to think about that well 
in our skin you never had to think about what am i   going to do with my life and then i was like maybe 
i would go to school i'm a teenager right then   like what are you going to study but you really 
don't have to choose that okay in north korea   they tell you if you go to school what's kokodu 
what you study there's no such a thing you choose   your major in north korea right regime tell you 
you're going to study art you can study chemistry   engineering right you might study gymnastics 
so now i'm like okay maybe i have to decide my   major but then what do you want to do as a 
job really to have think about that too it was   overwhelming not only that like when i go to shop 
there are 100 different types of pens right jeans   leggings shorts like mean shorts and in north 
korea no it was regulated government tell you this   is the type of pants you can only wear so i never 
had to think what kind of pants i want to wear   and i was thinking like oh my god if i get a 
frozen enough like potato and i have a guarantee   not getting executed i would go back to north 
korea and in fact some north koreans do go back   after finding freedom so hard they do go back 
that is how that that's the thing that you should   have more respect for the people who will not be 
free because then you gotta think for yourself   then like you have to be responsible for the 
choice that you are making right you gotta be   and i think here that's the thing like all about 
the responsibility and they don't want to take and   just so they want to give it to the government 
and then like oh this is gonna be voluntary on   the slave to the government wow wow it's well you 
know you look at uh like the soviet union or well   any uh authoritarian regime in history and like 
i've always wondered like how does a society get   to that point and it's usually not overnight it's 
not like suddenly a dictator has an army and just   takes over especially with communism like this 
ideology starts to spread and then suddenly things   get out of control so this is what you did i mean 
you used the word communist revolution earlier   is that kind of what you see happening in the 
united states oh yeah totally what do you think   is happening in portland right now i mean what do 
you think is happening in chicago right now it is   totally coming i mean they think destroying and 
stealing from goods in china is a justice right   this is what today's justice looks like in america 
i'm like this social justice warriors right their   word is stealing backs from chaner and i think 
in a way even the fact about their obsession   with gender right like x chromosome why chromosome 
facts doesn't matter anymore like it's all about   how you feel like as charlie said it's all about 
how you feel if you feel like a unicorn you're a   unicorn at this point right that's like the word 
that we are going into and i think the fact that   they believe that this country was built upon 
idea of racism and hatred and white supremacy   they will tear down every single part of fabric 
of this country and the world and they will be   but in order to rebuild their communist or 
social paradise they gotta destroy first so   that's why they're going after every single 
thing right now like they're literally going   after every single thing even the fact that the 
genetics x chromosome microbiome is so obvious   it's not obvious anymore that is what mark says 
in the communist manifesto you have to destroy all   pre-existing social conditions exactly exactly 
that's it so that's that's where we are going   to and in a way this is more intense than uh 
north korean communism revolution is because   it's social media is so powerful right you can 
so effectively brainwashed people and they spread   this ideas in the past when the communism 
was happening they had to go to town in town   and talk to people gather them right but now you 
don't have to you just have to use social media so   in a way it can happen so quickly it doesn't have 
to like north korea takes decades it can happen   literally in a few years time we are 
done they they just won the battle right   so i think the acceleration of change even the 
division when i came to america it wasn't this   crazy literally i don't think i heard anybody 
they don't want to set a foot into like the land   like florida or texas because of the biggest the 
trump supporters never heard that now i hear that   all the time from the people in sf or like in 
lane new york they get shocked like why do you   go to texas i'm like i'm not going to north korea 
why they're talking to you but me going to texas   almost like i'm going to north korea to them at 
this point wow when did you come to the us yumi   well i was visiting a lot in 2015 and then 
moved in january 2016. so that's only a couple   of years yeah but that wasn't like that bad 
it wasn't so what do you think what lessons   as a survivor of communism yourself do 
you think you have to offer to americans so honestly right like sometimes when this this 
nudist right we had so ungrateful so bitter and   had zero operation for history what our ancestors 
did what humanity went through to bring us here   the fact that we are alive here someone like had 
to fight for us in the jungle many generations   away fighting the starvation i was like maybe 
you guys deserve this punishment like destruction   when you gotta be starved like in north korea 
then you're gonna come to your senses knowing   how grateful you are how how grateful like this 
amazing this u.s constitution is but the thing is   i know that they are misled right they are a 
professor they were people misleading them and   they are also in a way are actual victims of this 
entire whoever drives it i don't know why they are   doing this but somebody is behind all of this a 
lot of people funding even georgie soros like he's   spending billions of dollars to destroy everything 
so i i think only thing that we learned is that   from china especially what i learned is that 
economic freedom does not bring political freedom   something so unique thing about freedom is you 
must fight for it it must be fault so you have it   and and i think that's it like in america only 
only thing that we have left is fighting for   freedom in this country it's so funny like 
until even last year i was talking about   freedom in north korea my fighting for freedom 
in north korea now i'm suddenly fighting for   my freedom in america my freedom of speech 
not getting cancer like it's like maybe i   was thinking do i bring a dictatorship is it my 
karma maybe wherever i go i bring them with me   if i do i'm so sorry i may buy 
this is what i did to this country   yeah maybe you could move to canada for us no it's 
already a mess there it's already happening there   so but yeah that is that is so ironic like 
you know you come out north korea and like   you you have this message about what life was like 
north korea in north korea and how horrible it was   and now you have to it's almost like 
you're telling americans how to be american   and so i i'm like because of the very such a 
humbling position i don't think i understand true   value of even freedom myself right it's so much 
beyond any human can understand what this does to   how much empowers human beings it is beyond 
anything but these people don't see tiny   bit of benefit of being free that is unbelievable 
they don't see they see the side effects of being   free so well but they never see the pros of being 
free even one thing about it yeah it's like that   analogy but like the fish doesn't know what water 
is because it just is in it all the time you know   yeah like i mean i often think that immigrants to 
america are often the best americans right because   they've experienced something else and they've 
chosen to come here and then they have a kind of   uh framework from which to evaluate america and 
appreciate the things that america has that they   didn't have before very fiercely patriotic a 
lot of people become very fiercely patriotic   americans um yeah i mean it's interesting because 
i think if you just grow up in it you just don't   you just don't even notice it right so you don't 
it's you don't appreciate it like you said because   you just and then if you're taught to just focus 
on kind of like the systemic injustices and was   the thing that obama used to say that was kind 
of to the whole like to form a more perfect union   so you know america has always been imperfect but 
we're always working on it and getting better like   to be taught that that's not actually the case 
that it's you know rotten to the core and always   has been and we're only getting worse and we'll 
never get better you know that then that you know   that makes you a hopeless person right i mean 
the irony is like you know we've just celebrated   juneteenth right which is like this day about that 
that celebrates america's end of slavery right and   it's like think about how amazing that is that we 
had this horrible institution we fought a war and   then we ended it and like the juneteenth is like 
the day that the troops the union troops went into   texas and emancipated the slaves and so like we're 
literally celebrating a change from horrible to   way better and like obviously there were many 
problems for a long time after that that that did   you know have i guess i think gradually improved 
uh significantly uh especially since the civil   rights movement but like is this not an indication 
that that we are forming a more perfect union he's like i'm like that's like how this is not 
enough like this is how this is enough right   you guys uh it's yeah it's that's the thing 
the education the purpose of education is   this learning about history right learning 
what what we haven't made a mistake like   all of those things that's what you're supposed 
to do when you go to university but they actually   ended up very twisted about reality i don't 
think that's the thing like they're really so   twisted almost like they're in a different like 
planet than like right what history book did you   read right like what i mean so i don't know 
but how are they so good at like making the   reality is so delusion like north korean regime is 
so good at it using a one actual fact it is a fact   but using is spinning in a way that it just makes 
the entire thing a different story well i think   a lot of it has to do with the media jumping on 
this like you know there's been uh the big debate   about critical race theory happening now and like 
on cnn they're saying like oh you know the the   far right is trying to prevent uh slavery being 
taught in schools and that's not what people are   arguing about they're arguing about critical race 
theory but they just reframe it in a way that's a   total lie and since the media is the bastions 
of truth who who's there to challenge them   yeah well i think you know on top of who's there 
to challenge it it's like if you you know we're   in new york city which is a pretty liberal place 
and you know if you challenge an idea that's uh   pretty much pushed in the media and is is common 
and you challenge it here like on the streets   of new york city like you don't know like maybe 
someone will will go after you for expressing your   idea right or beat you up or something yeah and 
so or you know the columbia university equivalent   which would be like canceling or getting you uh 
demarked or whatever it is that that they do right   so uh there's this enormous social pressure 
to then not question a certain view and so   you know there actually may be a lot 
of people who disagree but over time   uh the inability to raise that issue or the 
inability to ask critical thinking questions then   uh for some people they just stop thinking 
about it all together others they just uh   are just afraid to ever express it and so you end 
up with the overall environment being one that is   is not conducive to independent thought but 
rather uh everyone just feels more comfortable   going along with whatever the 
the prevalent narrative is   so we can all live in delusion together and 
then we're all harmonious yeah i'm curious like   have you been getting any backlash for talking 
about these things i mean you were on the jordan   peterson podcast some people hate that guy oh 
my gosh yeah that was a that's the thing like   right like i remember so my story dr peters 
was back and when i had a baby in 2018 i think   one day i was walking the summer downtown chicago 
huge dislike auditorium theater huge letter jordan   peterson sold out i never heard that name before 
right like it was like on the weekday too and   who said that the entire thing like that and my ex 
back then we were walking and then they were like   selling uh tickets like very high price in 
the in front of the door and then we bought   the ticket we went to enter the room fully fully 
packed and actually yeah a lot of men were there   and he dr priest has no slides talking about 
twelve words for life right going through the   normal rule number one two and these people 
crying in tears i've never seen anything like   that for like two three hours to lecture in that 
big hall and that's when i think that even if   there was a time right like if a stock test was 
alive or steve jobs alive we have a saying that   how much would you pay to have lunch with them 
so he was that kind of person to me but i'm like   living with the greatest thinkers of my time 
how would you like paypal luxury so when he   like asked for interview i was so honored but 
like i couldn't believe how much he was getting   but i also couldn't believe how much hate i 
given i get it makes all sense but afterwards   especially this time with the fox instead 
of people saying a lot of my actual friends   that like i used to say i love you all 
those friends now telling me i am concerned   and i understand because they used to do a project 
with me and their names are associated with me in   the past so now i think they're trying to protect 
themselves so they are also public figures   in a way i understand but then you know 
what i don't understand because these people   are the ones talking about justice and how 
hypocrite they are now the first thing they   want to do is protecting themselves 
not associating with a bigot like me and i mean of course random people like tell you 
if you like or die you're the fake and then a lot   of people challenge why did you have to talk about 
that on fox news and i'm like fox was the only one   who calls me on this even new york times across 
me right now i will be on new york times like i   will be on cnn this news was like this fast thing 
covered south korea like 50 articles came out new   zealand australia all other countries wrote about 
my article none cnn new york times msnbc none in   mainstream covered even one single thing about 
that article it was like as if they didn't pretend   that didn't happen right it was a big thing in 
other every other country every other platform   so i'm like it's not like i want to go on fox i 
i appreciate fox thank you fox news but then i   want to go on bbc too i want to go on all other 
people but then they don't call me so here i am   telling them i'm willing to talk to everybody 
about this and this is the thing like how the   fact that i spoke about this on fox news that 
was enough reason for them to never believe me   that's the thing that's like yeah i can't forgive 
you for having their view but then why was it fox   news i'm like it's the day that they say you 
are being used by this propaganda machine right   so like for you you're being used i'm like i 
like people like you know me i went through hair   i'm not being used i know how to like control 
myself so that was almost like are denier body   that's the thing because what i was talking i 
think it was hitting their home in some ways but   it was too uncomfortable instead they are looking 
for the reasons why i'm a liar why they don't want   to like think about this right one is i spoke to 
fox news that's enough reason second is you know   like also comparing i mean so they thought still 
like there was no guns pointing at you at columbia   so how is it worse than north korea but in a way 
i was saying the law loose of common sense the   chaos immorality was naughtier than north korea 
that's what i meant now when it comes actually the   punishment but there is a chaos in morality right 
in colombia right now there's never a wrong and   bad like good anymore you can never do it wrong as 
an individual now right in their scenario you can   be anything you can't fit anywhere everything is 
justified you can be wrong you can go on fox news   yeah so but like as long as you are not challenged 
their view you can never be wrong within their   system everybody is accepted right so this but 
the thing was heartbreaking thing was that from   the people who i cared about who i've been friends 
for many years i i cannot talk about who they are   because they are probably people and saying that 
trying to like cover their you know reputation   the first thing is that it is shocking and like 
this this hypocrisy is sickening to me all these   people they say oh i care about black lives matter 
like i care about women's rights blah blah they   try to fit in so they can get a job and they can 
like do right they can do good for themselves   and like i don't know actually how many people 
care about social justice issue at this point gosh i mean all this [ __ ] like shelly 
does this sound familiar to you in any way   uh what are you implying chris uh china like it 
sounds so familiar i i mean we've talked about   it before in the show the whole like guilt 
by association thing the whole uh it's about   uh you know who is making the argument or like 
like not the actual argument it's about you   know the the political correctness of where it's 
kind of very calculated to um not just use actual   punishment uh but to use like social pressure and 
punishment i mean i'm just thinking like you know   in china it's hard for us to understand now but 
if somebody got labeled a counter-revolutionary   like even their family and friends would have 
to like distance themselves from that person   oh yeah you had people literally reporting 
their parents yeah and then their parents   being executed and then they thought they did 
the right thing you know and hey you know the   buy to new domestic security plan you know 
he wants to have ways that people can report   on their friends and family who might be having 
don't worry about it chris it's just you know if   you see something say something just like in the 
subway yeah yeah this isn't a horrible spiral to   the bottom i i mean that is i think one of the 
worst things about communist society is how it   kind of breaks apart any type of social trust yeah 
like you can you cannot trust your neighbors you   cannot trust your friends you cannot trust your 
family members right yeah like if if you were   thinking about leaving north korea right who can 
you tell you you can you have to keep this all a   secret you cannot tell anybody what you're 
thinking in your mind right now wasn't that   something you said your mom told you that your 
tongue was your most dangerous weapon or something   yeah that's usually like the most dangerous 
thing that you have in your body is your tongue   it can kill not just you up to three to eight 
generations of your family can get killed for that   but the thing is about that trust right that's 
when i learned when humans trust we prosper   western democracy the foundation is trust isn't it 
like even the fact that getting into uber and not   like believe that i'm not gonna get murdered and 
robbed and like i believe that i order pizza and   they're not gonna put a poison in it and rocks 
in it it's our trust that's how we operate if   there's zero trust i'm never never gonna buy a 
pizza they're never gonna send me a pizza like   i mean what a horror world that is gonna be 
so in north korea that's what they do like   if three of you guys are sitting there matt is 
watching charlie like charlie's watching chris but   you chris is watching math so you're being spied 
and you're also spying on somebody so even you're   being such a good person not gonna reporting 
on shelly but madison report on you but if matt   is not gonna report on you he's being watched by 
shelley you're gonna be reported by somebody else   so everybody forced to report on each other wait 
so you guys have been watching me the whole time   because because i've been spying on you 
guys well matt you're easy to look at   well thanks chris yeah i 
mean this is crazy i went to   berlin a couple years ago and went to the stasi 
museum and it which is familiar which is the   secret police in east germany right under 
the communism and it was immensely it was   insane to kind of go to this museum and see all 
these stories and like realize that basically   like at least 40 of german society east german 
society maybe more were either spies or informants   for the stasi so like uh it's crazy like you 
everybody knew it knew at least somebody who was   spying or reporting on them and like this is just 
the way that they you know operated society and   then you know after um the soviet union fell after 
uh east germany fell you could go to these places   and see like they had the records opened so you 
could go see who who was spying for the stasi and   there were people there were people who didn't 
go because they said they just didn't want to   know they because they knew there would be 
friends or family or somebody very dear to   them that had been doing it and they were they 
decided they they just didn't want to know who   had been doing it it's kind of crazy to think 
about i mean when my when we came to the us uh   my mother told me when i started going to 
school she was like do not tell anybody   anything that happens in our family like in school 
you just do not talk about anything your mother   went through the cultural revolution so like 
at the time i was you know i thought this was   just like my mother's paranoia like and i was 
scared because i was like what are we doing at   home that i'm not supposed to tell people but i 
realized many years later that this is the product   of growing up in communism is that you know she 
was looking at i mean my grandfather was arrested   by the communists in the 80s i mean he was 
it wasn't that he had been like a dissident   or anything but he just got caught up in many 
of one of the many political campaigns i mean   he was an engineer or something right yeah 
he worked at a uh he was a an engineer at   a dam that's very political shelter right but 
like you know one day his friends came to the   door and said hey we gotta talk to you outside 
for a minute he went with them didn't come back   you know friends too yeah yeah i mean i i 
think what's insane when you talk about in   in east germany that 40 of the people were 
involved in spying in some way is that like   how do you as as an authoritarian regime get 40 
percent of people to be willing to spy on their   friends and neighbors and i think the answer 
is you know correct me if i'm wrong but like   they do it through convincing you 
that you're doing the right thing   by turning people in you're doing the right thing 
by spying on them i mean is that is that the case   in north korea where where kim jong-un or the 
the regime convinces people that turning in   counter-revolutionaries or equivalents 
is the right the morally right thing   the thing is they try to convince you that the 
right thing to do but then when they tell you   to do you have no option other than that i mean 
if to regime north korea sometimes you do this   it's like no is never an option for us we don't 
even know it's like no is such a thing the party   demands you to be dying right now in front of 
us we kill ourselves right they demand absolute   obedience from you so for people the concept of 
you can't say no to authority is not a concept in   our mind like whatever the authority says they are 
right right like whatever is it the animal farm   if the you know the napoleon thinks he's 
always right right he's always right so   that is so embedded in the minds of north 
koreans like even it sounds so ridiculous   like we never say oh that's that's that's wrong so 
back then especially when they demand you to spy   on people first of course they try this is gonna 
keep our social justice revolution continue but   then also people cannot say no i'm not gonna do it 
i'm like you gotta say yes i'm gonna do it right   well and so now here you are in the u.s saying 
no to all kinds of authority including this   crazy social pressure that's happening and you 
know like as i was saying earlier like how how do   you get to be a society like east germany where 
40 of the people are spying on each other and   matt i think you had a good point about it being 
because they tricked people into thinking what   they're doing is right yeah i mean i think that's 
part of it but i think the other thing is like you   owe me say you don't have a choice no like you 
cannot it's not just about making you believe   i mean i think there always will be true 
believers but there are going to be people who   uh don't want to do it but like you know you 
don't want to spy on this other family but   if you don't then they're going to come after 
your family right so the it's it's like you you   believe it and you convince yourself that you're 
doing the right thing because the price of doing   otherwise is just too great right and it's 
then it's like that i can understand that the   psychological compulsion to convince yourself 
that you are doing the right thing so you get   yourself to believe it because otherwise like 
you can't live with yourself uh for not being   willing to stand up to the government or whatever 
well well like young me like you talking about   these things you going on a fox news that you know 
you might lose a bunch of friends you might lose   opportunities to speak opportunities to write 
books like there's a lot of things at risk for   you because you you're talking about things 
that are not necessarily politically correct   very incorrect i mean it's very clear um but 
i do know now at this point the the gene the   humans right like the survivor incident is very 
strong that we can tell ourselves stories i mean   that's why i like like named my boo in order to 
live that we tell ourselves stories in order to   live right i think like what math that you 
can do that you can rationalize in yourself   keep saying those things and then don't 
feel horrible by yourself but the thing is   in this communism they don't teach you 
really morality being a decent human   so by turning somebody in it's not something 
you feel guilty about i think that's the thing   like i learned humans are so good in life free 
world and communism i'm so sorry to say that   but humans are so so evil and in a way also 
because they never learned what being decent   look like what being decent means so if i were 
like right now in north korea i never learned   i never like read the books like by dr 
peterson on like animal farm like 1984.   i never had the idea of learning these ideas 
how to be a better human i would totally turning   in everybody on my way and i would not even 
feel bad about it that's like a human nature   that's the thing like human is capable of doing 
anything right they can i mean they can become   kim jong they can like do holocaust to each 
other right and they can be so opposite way   that's why it so shocks me that when the education 
fails to cultivate people to become distant and   pursue moralities that's why it shocks me the most 
because in communism there's no morality it's not   like there is a communist morality means like you 
know become a better revolutionary for the regime   so i don't know how it was in china like were 
there people bad that were turning into each   other or they were stopped like they never 
inferred anything about it that's the thing   when i was seeing those executions and seeing 
people dying on the street like i feel nothing   and like this is what i think i was talking with 
dr peters for a long time like i literally thought   maybe was i i was a psychopath then like 
how could i possibly fare nothing right   but now i i feel them because now i know how 
you're supposed to fear so it's so messed up   you know well marx called it the specter of 
communism and i think he was dead on with that   it really is like this sort of demonic possession 
that just communism has been successful everywhere   it's been tried it's its goal is to destroy 
society its goal is to bring about death and   destruction well i mean i i also feel like marx 
and uh and angle specifically wrote that in the   communist manifesto that the goal of communism is 
to destroy uh society too they knew what they were   doing destroy morality destroying religion like 
it's it's not a it's not an accident it's a it's   like that's the thing they're explicitly saying 
yeah it makes people horrible well i mean i think   also the goal is to replace those things morality 
religion with communism essentially like with that   ideology it wasn't like what mao was doing was not 
just like destroying the four olds because like he   didn't like chinese traditions even though he was 
like a giant hypocrite and actually believed a lot   in chinese religion but anyway he was doing it 
so that the in people's minds anything that kept   them from believing 100 in communism would be 
gone there's nothing to tell you that there's   something else right like there's nothing to tell 
you that like there's another way to live yeah does it like so like now in the beginning i was 
like oh i don't want to be a honest right like as   a public person you're supposed to be a optimistic 
person like you gotta be keep talking about hope   and i will do my best on that right but it 
now feels like the puzzle is like fit in   like the erosion in every single thing is 
coming together and in one second it just   gets switched and now we are in actual the web 
communist revolution might happen in this country   like just one that switch like i literally thought 
like living in chicago last year during the ruling   they were like saying they are going to blow up   i mean trump tower and but they don't call 
them terrorists right they want to call   white supremacy terrorists everybody hears but 
that is not terrorism so i was so convinced if   trump wins these people gonna love chong tower 
and we're dead in chicago so i was like we were how how people are okay with this like every 
single day we are losing our rights in this   country and it makes full sense right this is how 
it happened north korea this is how it happened   china and all other countries and i don't know 
i mean i just don't want to be the point where   we went too far that we cannot push backwards 
right i just don't know what that point looks like   well so so let's let's try to to 
give a little hope what do you think   can be done to actually fight back against this i don't know because where kids go like at 
two three years old learning these things   in day school like i sent my child to 
day care they're already exposing to   this political correctness nonsense 
really yes can you give an example   oh my gosh there i mean in these classrooms 
like when i go it's like in the communist   communists love these banners right charlie 
they love banners so but there's like the phrase   and like if i was going to the 
classroom it's all these banners about   we're here to be inclusive blah blah you know 
all about like i mean it's okay i mean we are   equal but then it's like they really like almost 
like north korea virtue signaling how politically   correct they are but like thinking about two 
years always looking at these banners the   first thing they're going to remember is that like 
inclusive we are blah blah all these things right   i don't know what they're going to do to their 
psychology permanently and of course there's   school reports they give you know like um it's 
it's there are certain things you cannot tell your   kids they encourage parents to never tell kids no 
right because that's supposedly i mean there is an   advice so individual turns out they can 
never do wrong in the in from their eyes so i don't know like i mean kids are sometimes 
psychopaths right they are very selfish people   seriously they cry they demand they throw 
tantrums you need to socialize them they   have to be civilized and they don't pro they 
don't encourage you those like disciplinary   things like they send their parents reports like 
you know all those things but they are always   about whatever you are is okay like of course 
whatever is not okay most people are not good   you need to make them good that's the purpose 
of education but they are going to schools where   whatever you think is good as long as you're 
politically correct so i'm like it's daycare so   okay i'm gonna tolerate it but afterwards maybe 
it's gonna be really homeschooled i don't know   but i mean that's the thing like so you read this 
generation of people politically crap the banners   everywhere in their school like north korea all 
these banners and growing up with this mindset   the most highest morality is the political 
requirements showing your virtual like signal   what are they gonna do in the world when they 
grow up right what kind of things they're gonna   fight for i'm i'm sure they're not gonna try to 
empower individuals for sure enough so i used to   be i tried to be hopeful but the thing is yeah 
i just hope it's not too late that's the thing   well you know what gives me hope is that there are 
people out there like you who have the courage to   express their views even if they're 
unpopular views and i hope that more   people can find that courage in themselves 
to to knowingly say what they feel is right   and doing that knowing that they could be 
sacrificing something else and i think that   if if a lot of people do that then the result will 
actually be that people don't end up sacrificing   as much because we'll start to see that yeah 
there are a lot of people out there that   that aren't obsessed with political correctness 
and if we can all you know care for each other   and love each other for you know regardless of 
whether you're on the left or the right or some   other part of the political spectrum it doesn't 
matter like we're all here together right uh and   you know it admire the best in people instead of 
seeing you know this one element uh of people's   view on a particular thing we don't like but yeah 
i think the biggest thing is just people having   the courage like you to you know stand up and say 
well here's what i think is the right way to do   things i think that's a great message for everyone 
watching too because they can take this story and   act on it i know like so i i can't even like 
send to chris so after my fox thing there's a one   classmate from colombia only one sammy mex texts 
that i felt the exact same way during the colombia   it was ridiculous but i couldn't tell you because 
nobody is like north korea right we cannot tell   our minds like we cannot ever it's college we're 
free of debate like we talk about discuss ideas   but know it became all like echo chamber so i 
never thought there was somebody thought like   me in the class even though it was discussion 
class right and then she said i i i'm working   in new york but i cannot make it public but just 
i wanted to then show you my private support   and like well this is crazy so now she's worrying 
about of course she should worry about losing her   job you know she got to survive she got to 
pay the rent you know he's very expensive to   survive there so i i have a compassion for her 
but the thing is that's the thing is like those   when i came out people were saying like are 
north koreans are stupid why there is no   revolution right that was the main question i 
was getting people just amused how dumb north   koreans must be that we probably did and now i'm 
here like so if you stand up you what you lose is   your reputation your job but in north korea 
you killed three generations of your family   so how are you not rising up like if you thought 
nursing dumb and not rising up this makes no sense   why these people are not doing anything and 
being silenced like this that is a great point yeah i also like the idea that you know like 
if even if if you as a viewer uh you know don't   feel like you have the situation where you can 
publicly say what you believe but just sending   a private message of support to someone else 
who is you know whether they're being canceled   or whether they're just saying something 
that's that's not commonly accepted but   something that they really believe in i think 
just showing that you care about them and you   support them and you'll be their friend regardless 
of that i think is really important for all of us   i mean that's a good step but i i just feel 
like they want to fire you fine get a new job   there are new jobs you don't be addicted 
to all these little pleasures of life oh   i won't be able to afford my thousand 
dollar iphone oh no don't have an iphone go camping sleep on the floor says someone 
who's his own boss though well yes because i   made a choice and followed my passion and anyone 
watching can can do that themselves and when they   free themselves when they free their minds 
they can say oh you know what maybe instead   of being stuck in this slave job where i can't 
where i'm terrified of saying the wrong thing   yeah you have the freedom to do something else 
it's like they say free your mind and the rest   will follow the spoon isn't real but then comfort 
is so big like these people yeah they're addicts   they spend fortune to go and they are unless 
they don't get the corporate job they have no   chance of paying for it unless they like become 
one like what right general people don't become   like can make that much if they go to non-profit 
whatever small business right so only chance for   them to paying back is working for a corporation 
but the continuation of colombia where   they are obsessed with diversity of race not 
diverse thoughts so that's the thing that is   a toxic cycle right you go this expensive 
school you get a lot of debt then only way   for you to pay for is going a corporate job 
but then you have to agree with them again   yeah so why are we doing this you gotta 
i think that's why people are realizing   these expensive universities are a bad 
idea don't go into debt to go to a school   you have to break this cycle and ultimately the 
choice is yours yeah it is an individual choice so we are hopeful yeah well i think well i 
think there are a lot of things in american   society that just make it harder for like 
a authoritarian ideology to take place here   one which is you know the way that the u.s system 
is set up the way that the government is set up is   was specifically to limit the power of government 
like that is the thing that the constitution does   right like it limits government's power so that is 
that is a barrier another thing is the size of the   country is actually a huge barrier you know how 
big america is but there's 350 million people so   there are places people can go if 
they don't if they want to kind of   not live in new york city or l.a 
or chicago or these places where   uh these things are taking hold go to they 
can go life is terrible they can go to texas   nobody's stopping them it's not like in china or 
north korea where your your movement is restricted   right like china less than north korea but you 
know you cannot choose really where to live   uh long term uh so like there are things there 
are these kinds of like freedoms that give   americans the ability to kind of you know form 
local communities that don't subscribe to like   marxist ideologies to uh kind of uh you know 
have alternative things like alternative media   um even like nobody nobody nobody has to 
go to a state university right yeah like   you know there are private schools like on a trade 
yeah like they're or you know they are catholic   schools they're like there there are like systems 
set up in the country where like it's possible to   survive and live uh not in that type of society so 
i think that like there's a lot of ways in which   um yeah there's still a lot of hope in america 
and i think uh what we're seeing with what with   in schools to elementary schools um a lot of 
parents like the red line for them is their kids   you know do you see a lot of people standing up 
about critical race theory in schools now yeah so   uh and then like when that kind of snowballs like 
when you when there are more stories about vocal   parents coming out and talking about this and 
then you know it kind of gives other people the um   the bravery or confidence to come out and do the 
same thing like there's there i think there are   actually a lot of ways in which i think i mean i 
don't think it's like oh well yes now now there's   a communist revolution in the u.s that's not 
really where we are but i mean it does take people   i mean one realizing like you you kind of have 
to think about like what you really believe in   and what you're willing to put up with or not 
right uh and making those choices so it's it's   not a passive thing you kind of have to really 
like consider this for yourself and it's like   what you're saying young me earlier about like you 
you have to choose things when you're free like   you have to make those decisions uh and so it's 
not that like everything will be taken care of   uh and you don't have to like do anything 
about it but i think uh for people who do   want to do something about it there are a lot 
of things and uh it's not hopeless yeah i mean   so for me is that that was that's what i used 
think right but the thing is at colombia every   single class every single day we debate how the 
u.s constitution was written by this racist white   supremacist white men why we need to evolution 
rewrite it and there's a huge movement in every   ivy league school university is talking about 
trash u.s constitution right and the video that   i talked about why i support the second amendment 
on youtube that video of course gets like censored   so my problem is now the power is so 
solidified in the hands of big tech and media   and this time of course the fox talked about my 
views but then cnn new york times every other   mainstream neighbor like media pretend it was just 
nothing happened there so imagine hopefully foxes   are still there then but like on youtube they're 
gonna go cancel you and me everybody else who   has like this like libertarian views the every 
pocket carrier is gonna cancel they're like the   cancer the power right then next generation gonna 
never hear the idea is that us like supporting   the u.s constitution that view they are never 
gonna hear it so that's why i'm thinking like   the social power is so so like you know in the 
one place such a huge power in them in the tech   tech media so and also for the revolution right i 
mean china is a 1.3 billion people and they should   be without social media and it's a huge country 
with a different ethnicity like 56 different   ethnicities in china right so i think it's in 
a way it's possible for me it's more plausible   to do in the age of social media now in america 
and also for in order for revolution to happen   it doesn't have to happen every single time it 
just gotta happen in the big hot zone like the hot   spot zones that we talk about like we in they're 
very significant zones and the west follows   so i don't know like it it can like become 
something like that crazy dystopia or but needless   we have to keep the hope and keep fighting and 
keep talking his views no matter what we get right   and hope that justice prevails eventually but like 
what option do we have but i think now i'm like   really thinking realistic about the danger 
of america becoming like north korea   it's not like i'm crazy paranoid person but now 
i think like seeing the i mean this time like   it's cnn not even mention one single thing about 
facts in my interview with them it's ridiculous   as if they're like living in a different universe 
that's the thing like no matter what we gotta be   hopeful and gotta do the right thing and hopefully 
yeah we are not gonna be the last generation that   will ever free you know but that's a possibility 
that's why we gotta fight harder i think that's   what it is like instead of me i keep trying to 
americans now i used to be more like that person   keep telling them there's hope be hopeful but i 
think i want to give them clear picture what can   go bad how you can go so quickly back therefore 
now you gotta fight i don't know what what's right   but i think that's what how i said i am more 
concerned than way before i really truly think   there's a huge chance that america might lose 
this matter especially the thing if infiltration   right even in the youtube world there's so many 
youtubers get offered to be paid by chinese like   communist party to talk about defend their 
ideology i cannot say the rich youtuber   but he got like millions of dollars and told me 
that's what happened to him i couldn't believe it   even in the youtube world china is controlling 
not the only mainstream media yeah yeah as you   say the threat is very real but i mean fortunately 
it the communist revolution has not happened yet   we can we a little show on youtube have the 
freedom to interview you and get this message out   people can watch it people can get on they can 
still get on twitter and facebook and instagram   and all the major social media platforms and talk 
about this so they're it's it's critical that we   use this time now to talk about these things so 
exactly yami thank you very much for joining us   today this was fantastic and horrifying and i hope 
people listening will will share this podcast and   i hope they'll check out uh the interview you did 
on jordan peterson it was really it was amazing   also and they need to check out your channel 
as well do a plug for your youtube channel   uh it's voiceover north korea yeah yeah there 
we go and we'll have links below to everything   yeah but this was so so educational for me 
even thank you guys for doing this that was   our pleasure always great to have you on thank 
you i cannot wait to be back next time yeah   well i don't know about you guys but i i 
think we need to uh report young me park   for uh dangerous extremist viewpoints to uh i 
think they're setting something up okay yeah   if you see something say something yes yeah well 
i personally am inspired by young me park to move   to a solitary lifestyle in the mountains don't 
worry i've been watching you guys this entire time   because we're so easy to look at yes that's 
why oh great thanks shelly i hear the gulags   have great soup i think somebody people have 
accused me of somehow being some kind of like   chinese plant like chinese communist 
plant on the show yeah i'd say a fern   i have nice fronds that is exactly 
what i was saying shelly okay   uh yes obviously we're recovering from 
everything we talked about with young me that was   uh that was a lot um yeah but it's it's it's a 
good it's a good point for all of us to remember   that the the threat is real we need to use 
this time we need to use the freedoms we have   to make a difference yeah and i think also 
for those of us who are liberal to look at   what part of what's happening that is illiberal 
which is uh illiberal being you know restricting   freedom of thought or freedom of speech and make 
sure that that you know regardless of where you   are on the political spectrum uh try to make sure 
that at least uh we have an environment where we   can have those those basic uh freedoms and 
celebrate that diversity in each other of   diversity of thought and ideas and not you know 
cancel each other and instead listen to each other   i'm pretty sure that goes against everything yeah 
yeah but i mean that's the whole point is that if   we can't have a discussion then it's north korea 
well yeah it's it's not you can't really even   look at it on like the u.s left-right political 
spectrum this is freedom versus communism that's   the two sides i think it's i think a lot of people 
will find the talk about communism to be alarmist   because you know when we think about communism in 
the us we might think about the soviet union or   you know north korea things like that and it seems 
like what's happening in the us is different or   they're using they're talking about different 
things but i think we've had the conversation   before about how you know these kind of communist 
ideologies they're really good at using language   they're really good at using language in different 
ways and so the overall thing that we're seeing   is kind of two sides in america being pitted 
against each other to fight and that is like   the dialectic right and kind of the struggle 
and there was an interesting uh perry link   article where he was talking about how in china 
struggle is a transitive verb where you struggle   against people like we've talked about this before 
we you struggle against each other and in the us   it's we don't really struggle but we do cancel 
each other so the words are a little different but   what's happening in society or like the effect of 
these things uh or maybe the purpose of it is kind   of similar in the sense counter-revolutionary 
and rightist how different is that from being   accused being alt-right or far-right you know 
it's whatever the term is right whatever the   non-not okay thing it is to be at that time like 
a racist or like they're a nazi they're a bunch of   them yeah so uh so it's interesting that you have 
to kind of look beyond the vocabulary to look at   what is happening what the framework is what 
this what what is actually the overall thing   that's happening which is two sides polarized as 
far as possible being made to fight each other yeah so chris are we gonna struggle against shelly 
uh until her power starts to tip a little bit   and then i might have to join shelly to struggle 
against you at which point you and shelly might   have to struggle against me all right i'm sure 
it'll all work out in the end don't worry war is   peace that's why it's great to have three people 
because then you can all like kind of struggle   against each other at one point another it's like 
a tripod of stability and on that note thank you   for watching this episode of china unscripted 
feel free to share it uh links are below once   again i'm chris chappell i'm shelley jung and 
i'm matt ganesda i'll talk to you next time you
