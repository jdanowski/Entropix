now north koreans are finally realizing they have been slaves to the regime [Music] hi everyone i think today i have a good news for you all finally there's a good news so the new recent news came out from north korea is that there has been another uprising that is happening in the inner part of north korea so usually the inner parts that as it gets closer to pyongyang the weather is better there's more farming industry and there's more like ocean therefore people's wear lives with the grains and the food wasn't as bad as like in the north north is freezing cold it's hard to farm eighty percent of north korea's lands are like mountains however in the inner parts of north korea right now people are they want to reward the reason is why is this so kim jong-un has been obsessed with locking down the people's lives not every north korean can afford to be locked down like kim jones because he doesn't have to find food he doesn't have to do anything however if people cannot go working in the you know go in the ocean to catch fish or work in the black market how do they find food because the regime doesn't provide them in a way that now i'm living in america this feels way more socialism than north korea was like in america during the lockdown the governments were giving a lot of those like the subsidy and giving the checks to the people not in north korea even in this lockdown kim jong-un demands people not to do anything why do not provide anything to the people so which means he's just asking people to die by locking them down so now all these people in north korea are like in a massive famine is very beginning and people are suffering the parts in hungary providence this province is known to have a lot of the seafood and fruits and grains but this because of that the lockdown kim jong demanded no ships would go and fish in the ocean because he somehow believes that when the fishers go out in the ocean in the fish they get somehow they're gonna have a corona virus and if they meet ever like chinese ships or other ships in the ocean it's gonna get them like get a corona wire through the air so that's what kim jong-un believes however if this fisherman does not go to the i mean ocean and do not catch any fish how do they survive nobody can survive so they've been able to drive in this high type of fissures in that region and would get the secret of permission to go out and fish but now kim jong-un send a team from pyongyang to investigate and of course all these officials who were allowing these fishermen to go fish in the ocean got all got caught but at this point at this point is that the interesting about this issue is that nobody is happy in the situation think about this fisherman now they're thinking they actually this is for the first time north koreans are saying only revolution history that we learned in our textbook is of a guy called in gokton so in north korean schools we don't hear about french revolution or any other revolution that people fall for freedom but we only heard about this guy in gokzo in our history book is because when korea had a cat system beforehand before kings before the communism there were people who were in the slave caste system were suffered so much because of this type of loyalty and the bureaucrats so there was a guy called impgo jong he he gathered the slave class of them and then took them into mountain and started killing this royalty and then tried to start the revolution to make give the power to the commoners and we all like learn that history because kim min sung was like that kind of person he came from the common background and then he started the revolution and killed all these landowners capitalists and took all the power from them and gave it to the commoners or our people now north koreans are finally realizing they have been slaves to the regime they realize that they are in gokzonz they see that north korea is not communist and like socialist paradise there is this caste system in the top is like parasites are eating off from our hard labor our suffering so now this these people were saying for the first time i understand why in gokzon started the revolution and fighting against those royalty and they all want to be like him you know fighting of course the inca unfortunately he didn't succeed he made a big uh big improvement he was fighting and at the end uh he he got captured and got killed bravely in the battlefield but now nursing people even though my fate is gonna become like him i might fail in this journey of fighting for justice i think they don't mind dying that way because the alternative is death anyway because kim jong is literally asking people do not work do not go to ocean do not go to the fair do not trade in the black market just sitting at home and die from starvation and now people even these officials now who were allowing this fishermen to go to go fishing now they caught and some of them is going to be sent to political prison camps and some of them isn't gonna be even executed even for these elites so they are like elites in north korea and it's all about degree you can be elite in the countryside but they don't also get anything from the regime if you are the elite in the countryside the only reason you can survive in north korea is by getting the bribes as a doctor anybody who needs to get abroad because the ration doesn't provide to them so if this elites would not break the rule and let this fisherman go their family also gonna be starved so there's really nobody can follow the rule in north korea to survive and that's how the current system is and of course there's like a very very few type elite in pyongyang they are the ones it's gonna be okay no matter what happens because those are the ones kim jong-un gonna take care of no matter what but other than that that few percent of the people in pyongyang you just everybody screwed even your elite even bottom and they are finally realizing we are on the same boat and i think this is the most powerful piece that i get from this news is that even though those privileged people in the countryside now realizing that we are on the same boat this is our fight that we need to fight together to be free and to find our dignity as a human beings it is it is like amazing news because this hungarian province is something with the last province to come to this realization because they have been privileged in the geographically the weather-wise and they are so close to capital they have been much better off than people like like us being in the north now like everybody in north korea understanding we are one we have the same goal same mission i really hope that of course the coverage was horrible but i always like believe that what doesn't break us doesn't make us stronger i know of course like this pandemic broke a lot of people's lives but the people who survived who became resilient and we became stronger we learned so many new things because of this hardship that we experienced all together i hope that nor for north koreans the 90s famine was a great new beginning for people to be valued started escaping from north korea risking their life for freedom then 90s famine gave the opened a new door for the change to happen in our lives without the 90s family i would i wouldn't be escaped right nobody would escape if they were not starving why would anyone escape from north korea but now i think this pandemic gonna open the second door for north koreans to choose another destiny so thank you guys for keep standing
