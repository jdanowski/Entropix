I'm gonna have to be pretty subtle filming because I'm not actually supposed to be here morning open up on our way to a North Korean features I tell you these rolls are endless it's like a roller coaster they are so bad we be driving the ages and the bus is just Rocking you've honestly never seen anything like it when I did the seven wonders in the world I thought they were bad in Mexico but honestly North Korean roads are the worst surely would arrive in into one sand beach resort and it's where all the North Korean people go on holiday and really interest is to see where it will hold him Thor it's like all good me so we just head out here and just can we wander around here instead awesome cinema ain't right let's see what a North Korean beach Lazar has to offer I tell you I it absolutely stinks I don't know what that smell is what's that smell but you smell barbecued doesn't smell too good that Jesus there's like a little shop over here some locals in the back and like an ice-cream thing but I haven't got a clue what they sell because I don't understand the word of Korean coming onto the beach it is absolutely dead there's literally nobody on the beach that doesn't quite add up to God is it there is literally two Korean guys and then there's two Korean ladies in the back that's it yeah this doesn't add up I'm gonna take a bit of a war I don't know if you can see but in the back there's like diving boards I think there's like a ten meter one is there a five Mia one Eddie comes David Hasselhoff what'd you think of North Korean Beach yeah so quietly why is there nobody here like sleep so in it have you seen the jumps I know how sick is that Maykel Viet bombing off the 10-meter see what I can do Frank of a good roommate I'm gonna walk a bit more down here it looks busy well this explains a lot there's a big fence starting here and it goes all the way to the back over there I don't know if you can see but through the holes in the fence there there's so many people over there but then the other side of the fence there's absolutely nobody so it's obvious they're all the local people over there and then you've got all the foreigners over here but there is no foreigners [Music] that's crazy I wonder what the chances are they're getting over this fence [Applause]  up Tomita ok so now I'm walking down here which is on the North Korean side so I'm going to be a bit subtle with a camera look how busy it is on that beach over there and then it's dead over there I'm gonna have to be pretty subtle filming because I'm not actually supposed to be look at this bridge it looks like it's gonna fall apart I think these guys are fishing then you catch these there's a bit of a crowd gathering yeah you get thing you jump oh not too sure sorry my Korean very
