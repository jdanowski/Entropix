So aunty asked if I'll take the upper seat? So,  now it's night outside nothing will be visible and will reach at 7 in the morning. So I said yes aunty I'll take it.. It's okay! Rick got his seat here, our tour leader. He had his seat another side so aunty  said for some of her family member for this seat and he agreed. So I too agreed. No problem! Now we only have to sleep So we'll reach in the morning at 7 Sorry 7:30, Dangdong! And in between a major city will come, Shaniyang!  Around 3 am. And in this train all the baggage is kept that side.. See! I kept it there guys.. And you know that bag is now more precious than my life now.. My Mac book is in it visa of North Korea, passport and everything.. So let's see at night where do we have to keep it..
I'll keep it close to my heart while sleeping I think. See you at morning! My neck is aching, keeping it upside like this. Let's meet at morning.. Good night! It's 7 at morning..   And now it'll take 20-25 minutes left to reach Dangdong.. Now the farms are here.. We are at country side.. And bring your water bottle along you as till that vendor doesn't comes means you'll not have any source to get water.. So, I'll board at Dangdong and buy water to drink.. Now my throat is dry... And I'll tell you story of a child after boarding.. What happened last night.. 
It was very funny guys! Okay! So I'll tell you now.. I was sleeping at upper birth so, suddenly someone kept something over my leg and I thought it's morning and someone is waking me up.. Okay! So, when I saw it was a phone over my leg with it's flash light on.. And I'm watching the phone and asked whose phone is this? Take it! I didn't know whose phone was that so what else was I supposed to do.. I saw, I tried to open and it was locked.. Then all of a sudden kid came to my seat.. He was a grown up child and was eating fruit. So, he said some lines in Chinese
He was explaining me something. 
I said take your phone, go away and let me sleep. I mean you wake up and find a phone over your legs with flashlight on. How will you feel? It was a small story. And I was sleeping on that seat, uppermost. First it was this one then that as aunty requested. So now I'll tell you after boarding at Dangdong, what's next..
