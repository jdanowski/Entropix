you events i know you know about my work and i'm very very happy about that obviously it means a lot to me the it's yeah it's i feel like i cannot believe this is really happening i have been following your work many many years now thank you for for everything that you do to protect the freedom of speech well god bless you it means a lot to me that you said that so how have has there been any response at columbia to your comments well actually i have not gotten any comments from the school but i actually got some notes from my classmates actually they said that they felt the exact same way but back then they couldn't like express to me because nobody knows it is almost a little bit likely in north korea that we cannot really reveal what we think inside and it's all that are going you know along with the climate of the class and professor and i never knew there was someone like me thought the same thing but they never told me they never expressed it so that's how oppressive environment is that in america in manhattan in this 21st century we could have talked about it openly but nobody did so back then i thought i was the only one the weird one thinking this is like unthinkable and one of my classmates like she texted me two days ago after reading fox and you know she supports me in this and she said the same way but she won't go public well she would not she said like even now i i have a job i can never talk about it in public but what you need is very brave so i you know i support you just know that and that means a lot to me because i've been getting a lot of messages from my friends and they say i'm so worried about you i'm concerned about you i don't understand what you said on fox and i need to talk to you so i have some course uh scheduled ahead from my own and i have to in a way explain to people and these are my all my close friends so i was going to ask you do you have close friends um i do have a close friend in america yeah and is i assume it's a she is she at columbia no no she uh she's a lot older than me and yeah they are not coming from colombia so from do you have any friends in colombia i do but we never gotten that close it was a very superficial level and and given how i thought about the whole thing i could never become like respecting their i mean academic integrity so meaning was it was it was not any place to search for truth it was a place to be you know becoming a anti-western uh a tool almost has any professor thus far said in class how bad america is it's not just any professor that is every single one of them not just professors the instructors right now the visiting have you ever raised your hand to say you know i've seen repression there is no repression in this country i'm not expecting you to say that but i'm curious if you ever did so i didn't go that far i guess i wasn't that courageous enough but you're very courageous that's not an issue with you i'm just curious what you've said go ahead yeah so colombia has its core curriculum where you have to take the reference civilization music and art and in the right before the class right orientation they ask every single one of you what's your pronouns and then after we do all of that then the professor was saying so who has a problem calling this course western civilization music and everybody was in their hands i didn't like raising my hand and then everybody was saying you know because of this russian evil white men silenced the oldest minority people now we have to ending up studying this like you know biggest like bathroom and most most part so you know we could have supported some energy starting somebody from africa or somebody in the east or asia and i raised the handbag i told them i mean after all we are in the west you know in korea when you say korean music we don't say who have problems in korean music right wait you said this in class yeah i said i don't go on right go on go on yeah so i don't have problems studying lecture music after all this is in the west and you know every talent matters every history matter this is one of them i don't think that like as an oppression but then of course a whole lot that is looking at me horrified and say i'm brainwashed your brain won't your brain exactly wait uh i'm i feel like i've entered uh pyongyang here i i i it's it's it's bizarre first of all the this is a western civilization music course at columbia and the professor asks who has a problem with studying or calling it western civilization music then and most of them raise their hands i love them all of them accept you right your point by the way i just want to repeat it for my listeners in korea we don't ever have a problem with teaching korean music why in the west do you have a problem teaching western music but i would go further uh in in this regard young me i i would note that korea is producing a disproportionate number of the world's greatest western musicians the some of the greatest pianists violinists in the world today are korean and they're playing beethoven yep this is a thing where this those civilization western civilization created so much value into humanity our our advancement but now i'm coming to the heart of the west and they they despise it yes yes we're going to continue in a moment janmi park escaped from north korea and i it's almost eerie to say but she came to america for freedom and is watching it destroyed we'll be back
