hi everyone today in this video i invite you to have some time traveling with me back north korea this is 2020 last summer in heisen the city where i grew up in the north korean standard hassan is one of the richest cities in the country therefore even though i say ordinary lives but they are in one of the most privileged people in north korea looking at this my people's daily life being in america it almost looks like they are stuck in the 16th century i've never lived in 16th century but i read about it and it seemed way more like what i experienced in there in north korea nobody is holding their digital device when they're walking or sitting everybody very busy working she's making cabbages for the winter and look at all those north korean houses that is the one thing that i remember about my country being there i don't really remember seeing much color every land piece of land is for growing food and look at the car that i remember the car that is the fanciest transportation you can get in the country uh they carve like i mean burns oil and people also get into those fights later fights in this in the in the town often those roofs you see they don't block the rain or snow entirely so there is so much leaking inside the house causing so much smelling it looks like a slum but you know this is third richest city in north korea children still look very happy but i do see the hopelessness in people's eyes there's no hope and they don't even know what hope is when they're born they think that is what life should be and that's they think how all of us are living on this earth they have no clue about the lives that we are having here do you see those wire fences that because it's a border town the regime put those wire fences so people cannot escape and there are women always working those manual things they are putting the roofs on the house they do everything as you can see all those firewoods because there's no gas or electricity people using those firewoods to burn and cook things and in their yards north koreans don't have gardens because they have to make the crops everywhere they can find just their lives are very simple because all they have to do all day long all their life they have to do is surviving finding food so they don't have to die from starfish and this is just look of older north korean cities it reminds me seeing those sunflowers and north koreans in his and they love some flower seed i see some animals there and at some point him don't confiscate them but i think some people still have them and children in north korea learn how to work i learned how to cook at seven so everyone in north korea knows how to work and these are clearly children most of children do not go to school in north korea i mean we learn propaganda anyway but they cannot afford to go to school even though it's a free tuition but in reality it's not the teachers demanding so much price bribes so children stay at home working and do the older domestic work and parents go to black market and try it and find food for the family now i'm looking at i never thought the homes were that small but everything is so tiny in there i remember we are like four people or even five six people we would just live in the tiny room or in the same room together and we i cannot even imagine right now cooking like that but that's how we cook things outside of the house we burn woods and when it's raining it's so hard to start fire and when the wood is very cold in the winter time they dry those cabbages and plants because if you dry them it lasts way longer and you can use them in the winter time because winter plants don't grow and people have to get ready for them thank you for watching everyone
