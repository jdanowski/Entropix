difficult i am still extremely difficult i am still definitely definitely you know you know in a journey of you know you know in a journey of understanding sexuality and gender in understanding sexuality and gender in american context and it is definitely american context and it is definitely fascinating but for north korea fascinating but for north korea uh i think they are going to even
