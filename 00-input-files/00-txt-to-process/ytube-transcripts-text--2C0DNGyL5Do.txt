in 2017 the US government announced a travel ban on American citizens visiting North Korea due to rising tensions and a heightened chance of detention over the last 20 years more than a handful of international travelers have found themselves prisoners of the state after being detained under false charges make sure to stick around until the end to hear about the prisoners who were used as human experiments before we detail exactly what these people went through in the Hermit Kingdom make sure to LIKE this video subscribe to the richest and join our notification squad now let's get into the terrible things that happen to foreigners in North Korea hard labor committing crimes internationally is always a bad idea but it's even more dangerous in North Korea there's no chance of being led off with just an apology Kim jong-un makes sure that any foreigner who does something illegal will be forced to stay there and pay for what they did and that's exactly what happened to US citizen Kenneth BAE who was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor for committing hostile acts against the government hard labor is exactly what it sounds like brutal conditions endless days of manual work in the fields and barely any food or drink eating a diet of mostly corn and salt prisoners in labor camps lose their teeth their gums turn black their bones weaken and they'd hunched over at the waist as they age most hard laborers pass away before the age of 50 due to malnutrition related illnesses years of detainment while some foreigners in North Korea are able to leave fairly soon after their visit others are kept there for years on end Sandra su who was detained for covertly producing photos and videos to use in the anti DPRK smear campaign was luckily deported the same day that she was detained but others like Kenneth BAE and otto warmbier were kept for long periods of time Kenneth spent 735 days in a North Korea prison before he was freed and allowed to go back to the USA Auto only spent 529 days there but the conditions that he was kept under meant that he didn't survive much longer after making his way back to America bargaining chips what does a country use as bargaining chips when they're lacking resources in North Korea's case they use human hostages Kim jong-un has regularly kept Americans hostage over the years with the intention of using them to stop the u.s. from taking action in May 2017 US citizen kim hak-sun was detained for hostile acts against the republic and while poor kim was thrown into a detention camp the North Korean government was plotting how they could use him to their advantage and it isn't only Americans who suffer this fate since the end of the Korean War 3835 South Koreans have been taken by the north while the North insists that these people have stayed in the state out of their own choice their families disagree many people think that Kim jong-un is keeping South Koreans in the north as a form of power play to assert his dominance over South Korean president moon jae-in mental health if being detained indefinitely wasn't enough to have a detrimental effect on your mental health than the conditions that North Korean foreign prisoners are forced to go through we'll certainly do it international human rights groups are worried about the long-term effects that these camps have on their inhabitants Kenneth BAE spoke of how he was abruptly woken up early in the morning and shouted that until very late at night for weeks on end which is something that continues to haunt him years later another foreign ex-prisoner a Canadian pastor named John Sewell in 78 2757 meals in isolation throughout his time locked away in the North Korea in camp at the time he felt like he would never be freed and he felt an overwhelming loneliness withheld information american student otto warmbier made a huge mistake when he tried to steal a propaganda poster from his hotel in north korea after his family and the US government tried to plea for his release for more than a year he was eventually freed nearly eighteen months later but otto was not the same after his release the 22 year old had reportedly been in a coma for a year while stuck in North Korea and he passed away just a few days after getting back to America his cause of death couldn't be confirmed by doctors and North Korean officials insisted that he had contracted botulism however brain scan showed that he lost an extensive amount of brain tissue without any obvious trauma North Korea's obviously withholding information about what truly happened to Otto while he was in their care solitary confinement the only thing that could make prison conditions slightly more bearable would be having connections with other sympathetic prisoners being able to spend the day looking over at a friendly face would no doubt make most prisoners feel slightly less alone but foreigners who are captured and sent to hard labor camps are often left in solitary confinement for days or even weeks on end many of the people who are sent there are confined two years in prison because they somehow threatened to overthrow the government and of course the easiest way to keep people from forming groups and rebelling is by keeping everyone spread apart made up charges while it's almost impossible to get charged with made-up crimes in most countries it's the go-to option for detaining foreigners in North Korea most crimes fall under the vague umbrella of hostile acts against the state and can range from leaving a Bible behind in a public place like Jeffrey Fowle to taking photos like Sandra soon when entering the state it's important to specify exactly what there or you may face charges for lying other foreigners have even been detained for actions they've done before they enter the country Kenneth BAE worked with the evangelical organization youth with a mission in America and he was arrested in North Korea for preaching against the North Korean government in American and South Korean churches the list of crazy goes on and on interrogation an Australian missionary was detained for 13 days in North Korea for trying to spread Christianity he claims that he was interrogated for four hours a day and kept under 24-hour guard John short said that recounting biblical scriptures kept him sane during the cooling sessions which would be conducted for two hours at a time North Korea tends to let its foreign prisoners go once they admit to their crimes but this can be difficult when you don't even know what your crime is and when people do own up it's usually out of force or desperation rather than because they actually committed a crime the interrogation that foreigners face if capture can be endless it usually won't stop unless an answer or confession is found and even that comes at the risk of being thrown into a prison camp for an unknown period of time prisoners never know when it's safer to own up or to keep quiet human experimentation and for those that do end up in prison camps there are some punishments that are worse than others some North Korean defectors who've been through hard labor camps have spoken of human experimentation in the form of deadly poisons and medical operations this has never been officially confirmed but there's an alarming number of defectors who claim that it's happening there's no particular method of choosing which prisoners end up in the experimentation area of the camp which means that foreigners are just as likely to spend their final moments there as locals and defecting soldiers are the long lasting effects it seems to be rare that a foreigner is lucky enough to escape from North Korea unscathed and those who do go through terrible things at the hands of the regime find themselves struggling with the memories robert park was an activist who was detained in North Korea for illegal entry after crossing the China North Korean border on Christmas Day in 2009 after being reportedly attacked and harassed for 43 days he was pardoned but his detainment had a lasting effect on Robert and he suffered post-traumatic stress disorder for months afterwards he was even hospitalized Robert told the press that after what he went through in the Hermit Kingdom he will never be able to get married or have any sort of relationship he is deeply scarred by what he was subjected to during his detainment and will never truly know what happened to him that's all for some of the terrible things that happened to foreigners in North Korea do you think you'd survive
