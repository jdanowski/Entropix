[Music] hey guys what's up it's charlie here and today we're going to be looking at 10 crazy laws that only exist in north korea north korea is one of the most bizarre countries on earth with no other countries or unions around to interfere they can enforce any laws they want on their people and these are the craziest of all of their laws before we start be sure to like the video and subscribe and comment i subscribed and i'll try to reply so coming in at number 10 we have crying it's natural to cry when someone close to you like one of your parents or grandparents passes away but most people probably don't cry when their nation's leader passes away in north korea however this is not an option the leader of north korea is treated like a god and citizens have to pray to a statue of him every day the current leader of north korea is the infamous kim jong-un however before 2012 the leader was kim jong-un's father kim jong-il all citizens were forced to attend his funeral service and they all had to cry those who didn't attend or even did attend but didn't cry enough were sentenced to six months in a labor camp which many ex-prisoners have compared to hitler's concentration camps so there can be no one too manly and tough to cry in north korea next up we have haircuts when you go to your barber or hair salon you might get a conservative haircut or a more out there haircut it's nice to have a choice right well in north korea you don't have this choice not only do you have to get a conservative haircut you also have to pick from a government approved selection of just 14 haircuts with women generously being allowed 18 haircuts the country really seems to care about hair as in 2004 they released a six part tv series called let us trim our hair in accordance with a socialist lifestyle the title might not be that catchy but with the lack of tv stations in north korea the show pulled in a good amount of viewers the government also have surveillance cameras in public places to catch people who don't have state approved haircuts to catch and punish any crazy rebels who decide to get their haircut a centimeter too short next up we have bibles in america and many other parts of the world bibles are everywhere and it wouldn't be uncommon to see one in a bedroom drawer or in a hotel room however in north korea bibles and any other religious practices are banned and this includes other religious texts such as the torah and the quran the government are worried that people will learn that freedom exists and might even begin to worship religious figures rather than their country's leader if anyone is found with the bible even if they're a tourist it's confiscated and they could face punishment if they're a citizen or deportation if they're a tourist so if you're a devout christian then i suggest not going to north korea next up we have television for many watching tv is a popular pastime whether you like to binge watch trashy tv or keep up with current events well in north korea there's only two television channels available but it's not exactly hbo and abc the channels are owned and strictly controlled by the state and the purpose of both channels is to promote north korean propaganda one of the channels shows public service announcements of propaganda such as the hair series that we talked about before the other provides news however the news is often inaccurate and revolves around promoting kim jong-un and of course criticizing and lying about the united states and its allies next up we have no cars i'm sure you can't walk outside without seeing a car or two well in north korea if you walk outside chances are you won't see any cars at all only certain people such as people working in government are allowed to own a car the cars they do have are comparable to the american cars of the 1970s as north korea hasn't caught up with automobile technology probably because the number of people who have cars in north korea is so small in fact only one in every 1000 people own a car to put that into perspective in the united states one in every 1.3 people own a car in fact there's such little traffic that people tend to just walk on the roads rather than on the sidewalks as the chances of being hit by a car are pretty much zero next up we have free time while it's not good to lounge around all day doing nothing it is nice to relax after a long day's work however in north korea there's no room for free time everyone must work at least 70 days straight and if they want to take a day off they have to pay a lot of money the citizens have a six day work week with an extra full stay of volunteer work this means there's no free time in north korea this is so the economy is as good as they can make it because north korea doesn't trade with other countries their economy is very weak and north korea sees people as resources rather than people so simply use them for labor next up we have no photos if you go on vacation there's no doubt you'll want to take a few holiday snaps but if you decide to take a trip to north korea then you're going to come into some trouble if you want to photograph your vacation it's illegal for tourists to take photos of north korean citizens if they're not dressed well it's also illegal to take any photos of people who are malnourished or poor images that show north korea as being inefficient and not having enough resources are also not allowed and of course photos of their military and government buildings are also banned in north korea and despite the fact that the government spies on their people with cameras all over major towns citizens are banned for the most part from owning cameras unless the kim jong-un's appointed propaganda photographers next up we have women soldiers while you might think that a country so stuck in the times wouldn't give women many rights north korea do allow women in their army and have a whole unit dedicated to them however this doesn't mean that the female soldiers of north korea have it easy to become a soldier they have to go to a brainwashing military camp where they learn phrases such as we are killing americans and when they graduate they have to work for hours and hours every day they're frequently used in parades to make the country look good and as a result of this they have to have the exact same haircut and wear the same mini skirt uniforms they're also often tied together by the neck with wire to keep them all in line and looking good in parades it's safe to say that this army is one of the most poorly treated in the world next up we have family punishment if you commit a crime you go to jail and then you're released simple well things are very different in north korea if you commit a crime it's not just you who suffers the country has a law called three generations of punishment this means if someone commits a crime not only would they be punished but their parents and their wife and kids will be too regardless of your parents who may be old aged or your kids who may be young or even unborn the whole family of a person who's broken one of north korea's strict rules are sentenced to work in labor camps with no food or breaks and sadly most people don't make it out and next up we have voting while north korea is a dictatorship meaning they have no choice over who their leader is it's the law that every citizen has to vote otherwise they can be sent to a labor camp the odd thing about the voting system in north korea is that there's only one candidate kim jong-un no one else has the money power or voice to run against him and while there have been times when others have been listed on voting ballots as well as kim these were just fake political leaders that were made up to make north korea look more fair north korea's official name is the people's democratic republic of korea but it looks like their people don't get much democracy and that just about wraps up this video
