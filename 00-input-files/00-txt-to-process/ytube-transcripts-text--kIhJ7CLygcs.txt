so we're here in Pyongyang North Korea we're at the hotel Pyongyang Koryo which is one of a small handful of hotels that foreigners are allowed to stay at and this is day one of my visit to North Korea so I don't have much basis for comparison but from what I've been told this is one of the top hotels in all of North Korea it's super luxurious you'll see in a second I'm standing outside right at the street and I've been told that I can't step any further beyond this stone sort of line there that's the hotel property I think none of the guests here are allowed past that line and we're certainly not allowed to wander off into the city even though we're in the middle of the downtown area so as our as our guide told us we're kind of in our gilded prison here and you'll see what I mean in a second it's pretty opulent inside but when we go check it out so here we go revolving blast elevator very nice touch and here we are in the lobby as you can see there isn't really one way to describe the architecture here it's kind of a tacky disco retro 70s thang on but as you can see this place is massive glass dome and everything I mean on the surface level they did a great job the really interesting thing is there's actually two towers to this hotel I think each tower has around 20 ish 20 some floors and there's a bridge that connects the two towers at the very top I wish I could take you on that bridge but unfortunately no one's allowed on that bridge right now there was just a fire a couple of months ago on that bridge and and that fire was actually pretty famously covered by a bunch of tourists who were actually staying at his hotel at the time they got a whole bunch of trouble because they shared it on social media and I think ended up getting in a whole bunch of trouble the police so let's try not to have that happen again but as a result no visit to the bridge this is the reception desk and let's go deeper into the atrium now this is pretty opulent as you can see it's just mirrors everywhere and these kind of rainbow disco lights going on sort of giant landscape fresco see a lot of those in North Korea [Music] so a couple a little while ago I guess a couple years ago revolving restaurants were a thing in North Korea and so a bunch of the really nice high-end hotels ended up building these revolving restaurants so since I couldn't show you a picture of the hotel from the outside here's a here's a drawing of it that's the very top and you can see one of them is like a circular revolving restaurant thing apparently the food isn't very good but I haven't tried it myself here's this sort of disco rainbow Saturday night Night Fever kind of thing going on here just like a water fountain thing all right we're going to go up to the my room here this is Tower one and I'm going to [Music] [Music] all right now we have to wait actually as we wait let's just take another look there's apparently a fitness club on the lower level but they only open at 10:00 a.m. which means that none of the tourists wow it's a fascinator wait oh my god alright let's chop off my hand here all right I think I'm on a team so yeah there are I was incorrect there's 32 floors and apparently room for expansion they decided to build more towers but yeah it's a tall it's a tall tower I think this is one of the taller buildings in Pyongyang I don't really know for sure but from the outside when we were arriving it looked like that for sure so here we go we're about to arrive at the 18th floor and here we go so now we're in the elevator lobby here's the view from the lobby elevator and you can see it's just this sort of stark or Architecture from the outside this is this is tower 2 but we're looking at right now so this is the the sister tower of the one we're standing in the other half of the hotel what's really interesting is if you look there the lower floors are where our handlers and the locals live when they're visiting when they're when they're hosting us and I guess you can't really get a good look at that but it's a completely different environment than the one that we're staying in when I one of the elevators that I took actually opened up on the other my lower floors as I was coming up in the first time and there's like a ping-pong table set up right where we were just standing in the lobby which was kind of funny all right there's a dark creepy hallway probably maybe conserving some power and here we go to room 1807 and this is our our key card to get in so here we go it's dark in fact this is kind of how it was my first cut in so I'm kind of a weird thing the key is pretty cool he actually did a full electronic key card system look at that let's shut this door cuz it's beeping at me okay let's take a tour of their room shall we let's turn some lights Oh creepy dark bathroom let's turn on the light alright so pretty standard kind of old-school whole bathroom you got your toilet your sink really low ceilings I'm gonna hit my head almost as I walk into this I'm gonna stoop down here so you can take a look there's this old school sort of showerhead thing you've got your kind of standard amenities kit going on shampoo conditioner bath foam and all that goodness and some soap I don't know how good it is but you can find out there's a there's a Kleenex box holder but no Kleenex hope you know have a runny nose or anything when you come visit North Korea it's dark here and don't know how to turn on oh here we go let's turn on this light well so what you have here is kind of this like sort of sitting area a lounge room tea room coffee nook I don't know how you call it it's got like a step to get up and you've got your chairs and this view of a construction site which I won't show well briefly dip but they're not a huge fan of construction sites being shown and look at that sunset pretty incredible right and then you got some really crazy factory smokestack action going on and the background around the horizon there can't be good to breathe that's probably only just a few miles away from here and but it looks it makes for a beautiful sort of sunset visual alright as we move out of this coffee nook space let's go check out the bedroom you got your two beds here you've got this refrigerator which I checked earlier I was it kind of excited about the fridge except it's not on it doesn't actually work I printed up to max about an hour ago and it's still hot so yeah but you know it's a nice sort of showpiece I guess and you got let me see if I can turn on some lights here yeah that's that's all we got you got your North Korea calendar pretty cool yeah here we go that'd be a nice little souvenir for anyone actually wanted to Jack the camera a calendar yes you can control your well actually I don't even know what these things do let's see so you got some controls down here for your bed foot boom sorry as I'm clicking these things nothing's actually happening TV did not turn on oh that works a little dimmer switch for the bed that's nice volume control for the radio so it's am-1 they have and one and two BGM one which background music perhaps which is nothing BGM to off so really nothing on the radio right now I don't know if anything ever is on all you get like this arcade game background noise thing bonkers and then you got your clock which is telling the right time the funny story about the clock I hear 647 just a few weeks ago North Korea decided to change their time zone to their own and shifted their time half an hour later than Beijing so yeah but it's actually 6/10 or sex 6 to 15 p.m. in Beijing right now but it's a 6:15 and a 6:45 in Pyongyang so it goes it's good to make your own rules you got your TV here which we'll check in a second but here's that sort of picture window action going on again with that beautiful sunset but let's see what's on TV and this I haven't done either yet no actually it's wrong some more lights ok that's better all right let's see what we have all right so that's a good sign whoa and it's the brand of the TV it's the same channels not coming in clearly Oh BBC World News Wow [Music] all right so I'm guessing these channels aren't available to public this is very impressive Russian Russian TV here Chinese TV CCTV CCTV more this is incredible right so hey you know maybe they'll uh they can find some HBO as well so there you have it that's the room thanks for watching and thanks for visiting with me here in Pyongyang thanks
