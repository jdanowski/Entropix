so I've just paid 80 RMB which is Chinese money for this little basket so I've got swimming shorts locker key flannel shampoo shower foam and a towel so it's worked out like 10 euros for the whole basket which isn't too bad before I go into the water park I've been told that there's a barber shop in the water pad so I've already gone for a quick trim first I have some hair cut okay Laurence thank you how weird is this a full barber shop in a water park one chair to chair three chair for Jeff five chairs on second thoughts I think I'm gonna pass on hair I don't really want to get my hair [ __ ] to be honest so let's just go straight into this water path on the road big it's gonna be changing rooms this way thank you it's busier here than it is in actually Pyongyang this way thank you I didn't think it was a good idea to film in there I didn't want to show you all the naked Korean men I tell you all this place is round it is absolutely huge as well there's an upside to it my dog look how big displaces you've got like a huge slide in the back over there and you've got like swirly say big ball oh my god it's huge I genuinely can't believe how busy it is here this is the busiest I've seen it in North Korea since I've been here or is happening over here [Laughter] oh my god I'm liking the matching trunks this place is insane right my turn to go on something Jesus that was the

where may I love the North Korean song at the top he deserves [Applause] hahaha the most scary part was in July and the platform I just jumped I have to wait two minutes my knee started firmly drummers German but we did it we did it mate what a day at this water bar I didn't even know North Korea had water parks what'd you think of the water park me it was amazing only the slight orbit laughs but the Germans were awesome thank you [Music] right super informal very informal very all three cameras I've obviously my first time in North Korea so I'm a bit naive to it how many times have you beam up coming up to 70 times now 70 times and what your experience with coming here every time like fewer things every time you come on every single time I come here and I think this is why I love working so much because it is such an interesting country to learn about and the more times you call me if you enjoy it more every tiny yeah I mean like it in today you know it's a job but a job that I truly love doing wonder comes here it's a great holiday and sort of fun that's something you know it's an incredible cultural experience to see a country that is so different from basically the rest of the world it's a fascinating thing in the air laughter right frame of mind and you can come in with an open mind and you're ready to sort of I guess put politics aside and an experienced people in this period you can really have a pretty life-changing experience and so that to me is amazing to facilitate the air since I've been here I've had a different perception of into what I thought I was coming India to be honest I don't normally like research stuff that I do I always like to go in with an open mind that's like it's not what I thought it would be to be honest what did you think was gonna be like I just thought it would be like sort of dramatized you know me like you know people say oh yeah you know it's all gonna be still you shouldn't stuff but yeah we've traveled enough around it yeah to see that it's not actually people are just getting on with their lives and like I think it's important as well like with the itinerary for a temple I need to come to you in the morning I've gone Matt what are we doing today and you've gone we doing this that and this but then that's changed that's been our your palace or we've gone somewhere last-minute yeah so they've not been prepared for that yeah oh yeah the first time I came here I really wanted that like Truman Show experience that you read here about yeah and I did the exact same to her that you've you've done back in 2014 two days liberation day and summer tour the thing that I took away which is much like you have is that oh damn it's not this Truman Show fake actors everywhere yeah this is just a country that's getting on with their lives people here just want to live they want best for their families and their friends and their future what are your thoughts on people that say by coming to North Korea your suppor in the government I believe that tourism is one of the most important forms of cultural exchange for a country like here which is already very very closed off I don't really see how further closing it off from coming here is helpful attaboy yeah for both under smoochy understanding for us as outsiders and also for the Koreans to see that you know the outside world isn't out to get the religions Nobel Prizes year the whole of my brand skin is to inspire young people of just people in general to travel it's a experience different things and then you know living in places no money you know you don't have to have a fortune to travel living in the UK news news about all these different countries war here I just want to show it for what it is in there I don't know the ins and outs of all the countries are being too but all I can do is document my experience from my visa Lee that's what I've done on this trip the people who yell loudest yet up North Korea I guarantee of the people who have never come here before yeah and yes it is a unique country yes there are things that could be improved in this country yeah with that question but there is more happening in this country than goose-stepping military soldiers and you know missile tests and if you come anywhere with an open mind willing to like listen to people to learn from other countries think about other perspectives that are not your own because we live in a damn big world with lots of different perspectives yeah you're gonna have a truly eye-opening experience here last but not least what would you say to somebody who likes traveling but has got this negative view of North Korea honestly it's not for everyone here like if you don't want to come don't come if you want to experience a truly unique country which is going to test your whole idea of reality ideology and culture then come here with an open mind I guarantee that you'll have a unique experience whatever you take away because I come here and Hiva a unique experience yeah yeah I mean like just come with an open mind I'm not gonna tell you like hey come to North Korea's gonna like you know blow your mind maybe you'll just think it's bizarre maybe you'll hate it but yeah come with every mind over and it's a fascinating place I should have mentioned this at the start but Matt's a tour guide for YPG I'm gonna put their link below I'm also gonna put Matt since the ground below so if anybody does want to reach out or see the stuff Matt's been up to definitely check that out any last words mate I got some you down [Music]
