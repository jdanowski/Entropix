hi everyone this is han in north korea this is my hometown the hometown that i always miss that road i walked on it many times and i'm not sure where can i walk back on it again i remember being a child in north korea i used to play with my sister and my neighborhood kids even though i was very hungry and we didn't have enough barbies or fans toys but we still had each other they were huge comfort to me they gave me so much happiness and the memory that i still cherish to this day i think they're complaining who can jump furthest and i did a lot of those when i was child and just normal house that you know every north korean lives in even though they don't get you know almost penniless salary from the region people still work very hard and women usually are more engaged in the market business the north koreans don't have strollers so that uh back that hot piggy back is the most common way of carrying a child uh those kind of cars is very rare and it will be quite a sight if any car shows up like that all the children would go out and looking at the car it was a good size scene for all of us and even the north korea he has zero cases i see a lot of people just using mask as a almost like decoration on them it's quite funny uh those net the rose are so narrow in north korea because those spaces are very small for the people so they are really like people live next to each other oh right now as you can see these wire fences guys uh this is the wire fences the north korea put up on the border so people wouldn't escape and there's guards everywhere that people cannot even escape anywhere but they stare pre preventing people to escape and now north korea is making them a war not just these fire fences building on top of this wire fence they are building more on it that is the north korean train and fence train is supposed to be expressed however it takes you know sometimes several weeks going from heisen to pyongyang the same distance in south korea would go for two hours uh those are uh they are just normal houses just average houses but hasan is one of the richest city in the country so you are living still looking at the most privileged people in the country they don't they can't even afford the windows so they use those plastics to block the wind out and usually bicycles are the main transportation for the people we cannot even dream of having a public like bus or train people normally walk and if they are rich they can afford the bicycles and i think they are trading some dried uh you know cabbages they they're very good for the soup and i just see so much just hopelessness in their faces all they have seen in their life is oppression [Music] and it's women just working in the field without even gloves and that's all they do all day long just working as you can see you see more women in the street because men must go to work even though they don't get paid or men must go to work therefore women have a bit more freedom to walk around in the town go to the market and women are the ones brother winners in north korea and baster man is very dominant force in the society all of the roof and the wood got rotten and i remember being living in one of those homes they didn't they don't like block to like rain or snow storm so much licking and everything was just smelly but i did not know better i thought it was still good when i was there yeah it's like there's a reason why most of women escape because men have even way less freedom than women to even do anything in the country it is amazing to see that children smiling thank you for watching everyone
