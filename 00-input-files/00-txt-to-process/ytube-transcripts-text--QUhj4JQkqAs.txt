in the South Korean capital of Seoul we've made contact with a young man of 26 years who until two years ago didn't know that a world existed outside of the barbed wire phenomena Thea I didn't know not at all not until I escaped he quite simply thought the whole world was a prison camp he didn't know that the country North Korea existed that something exists outside of that country he didn't even know that the mastermind behind his miserable life was Kim jong-il the children from camp 14 was so worthless that they didn't deserve knowledge of the life and thoughts of the Dear Leader Shin dong-hyuk is not special in the sense that he has escaped the North Korean prison system tens if not hundreds of thousands of prisoners are loved up there and a few have managed to escape but he's unique in the sense that he's the only one known to have escaped a so-called special control zone that's a special camp system within the camp system where prisoners are expected to spend their whole life he's the only one who has come out alive and has been able to tell his story we meet shin at an old prison here the Japanese kept tortured and murdered Korean patriots before and during the Second World War it's an environment that he recognizes immediately I was in a Cell exactly like that Shin dong-hyuk story began on the 19th of October 1982 his parents were prisoners in camp number 14 isolated in the mountains north of the North Korean capital of Pyongyang the reason why is not known but as a reward for good behavior they were selected for marriage and put together in a cell for five days nine months later Shin was born behind the fence one thing followed him every day we were always hungry the little boy was placed with his mother but you worked every day in the mountains and minds from 5:00 in the morning when she returned around midnight she had no time for the boy she often beat him he learned nothing about coming humanity more this dancing our own I had no real feelings when I was a kid can he also say when I would eat an in-game shoe categories of people inhabited the world behind the wire that's there for any time against a time only those who made mistakes were prisoners those who made no mistakes workouts Madonna said I'm with hygienic as ever has he thought about how a good thing in the eyes of the little boy the starved and sometimes beaten woman who returned to him at night was the course of his suffering Daniel's affair where my mum had made mistakes so it was only natural that we should live like this I didn't even want to know why at five he was sent to school in the mornings they taught him to read and write to add and substract the teachers were guards with pistols and sticks to beat the little ones one day he witnessed a teacher beating a little girl on the head so hard that she died the next day in the afternoon the five-year-old was sent to the mountains to do hard labor the only positive thing about that was that it was possible to catch mice rats worms and snakes for the eternally hungry stomachs friendship and closeness didn't exist everyone was on his own everybody else could be an informer our society was constructed in a way so that my mother was supposed to inform on me and I would inform on her but they came when Shin was taken from his mother he was placed in the dormitory and supposed to attend secondary school your desired there with underneath it's not Vanessa from 12 years on it was nothing but work but they called it secondary school there was no reading or stuff like that San Jose is a telepractice no the housing didn't I was on a holiday it would be two years before he was to see his mother in an unknown brother again but before that he was suddenly dragged out from the dormitory by guards thrown into an isolation cell and subjected to unspeakable torture his mother and brother had attempted to escape the idea was to get the 14 years old boy to reveal if he knew anything about the attempt but he knew nothing and couldn't tell anything the torture went on for seven months one day it was the 29th of October 1996 Shin was dragged out to an open square and placed in the first row of the prisoners there he thought he was about to be executed but then they brought out his mother and his brother pained and why I think it is better we skip this part the brother was shot the mother hung she was tied up in gigs but just before she died she looked directly at him he avoided her eyes from then on a miserable life was transformed to daily naked horror she took after the death of my mother I had an incredible hard time I was beaten every day I almost died the other children attacks him your life is lost they yelled and laughed they stole his food and all the time he hated his mother and brother for what they've done anymore I blamed them a lot it's hard to express like a manatee gentleman said Osceola yeah oh ma but it was a good thing that they died on my own value on my affair what table Manila Oh Omar Hammami to me to get at it down with Lucas after all they had committed crime years went by Shin was teamed up with a guy who had lived outside the wire he told the boy about Kim jong-il and his father Kim you'll assume and about the fact that a world existed up there where there was endless amount of food every day morning they gave out the food made me escape even if it was going to cost me my life the only thing that interested me was the food one day in January 2005 using the mountains with a friend hauling timber it was Twilight and cold the guards were away for a moment the electric fence was only 20 meters away this was the chance of a lifetime let anything happen how if we don't run now we may never get the chance again office Corona since I'm up we shall return to Shin's escape but before that we have another contact to meet shins friend yuck Kang Kang has made the drawing for this program based on his own experience and the stories of shin and other defectors we meet 23 years old Kang at a modest private center that collects documentation about North Korean defectors shin and Kang are small dyes their bodies themselves document that something is awfully wrong in the north so these are your drawings a book honey are important I gotta cover you children in North Korea much smaller sixth graders in South Korea are more than 170 centimeters in height nor a the 150 to 160 llamo Patricia no wonder toyline no Kanaka you coming little more giggle we hunted ueshiba it was started about the attack show the value in tomorrow vato their faces are always swollen because of hunger Kang hasn't been to the camps but he knows hunger very well it arrived in earnest in his small provincial town during the early 90s where North Korea was grinding to a standstill there was no economy no fuel no work worst of all the state food coupons became worthless the sills were empty the first to die were the old people and small children the bigger kids and adults were out in the mountains digging for moles rats mice frogs and even grain worms the landscape changed from green to brown one on top was the mountains were cleared of anything green eventually they didn't look like mountains just bare soil a problem later the town sang in too deep apathy many homeless people settle in the ice-cold railway stations / trains rarely arrived the orphans who were too small withered away and died okay pomian Park wash of silicon you good people had nowhere to sleep in one song where I lived there's a train station which is always open when people had no else to sleep that's where they went some small children actually lived there where the kettle one will later get your little ton of organic latte I did among horrible knock over the streets were empty now once in a while a car passed people from the party of the state as a longer will cut the ones in high positions live well they don't help anybody dozen society head comes a full-stop only the forces of oppression work Don Roger what singular upon him at all when somebody squealed to the police people would suddenly disappear at night I've heard they ended up in prison camps but what about all the food that South Korea Japan and other countries sent I've never seen that or heard about it turn on like the forces of oppression propaganda still worked while little children died before their eyes people were told that they lived in a paradise and that people in South Korea and elsewhere were much worse off now what I thought that we in North Korea were best off in the whole world Kang didn't know better so when his father who had been in the camp decided that the family should escape abroad he was crestfallen I look at this at first I said no I wanted to protect the fatherland my father said fatherland what country is that what a [ __ ] country after the interview Kang's friend Shin comes around we've decided to go out and have lunch before continuing the talk there's an abundance of food in South Korea and that is the only thing that the two friends really appreciate in the south the field rootless and helpless in this society that operates under a totally different version of the law of the jungle than they're used to they were taught total obedience to higher powers here they're expected to make their own decisions every hour of the day under increasingly vo was kissing you I've got a new cell phone the newest model isn't for you okay yes time for food shin and Kang spent their whole childhood and youth in a state of permanent hunger until he escaped two years ago Shin had never tasted meat except raw fish rats mice frogs and the like no more of their 30 death we need to finish the story of shin and his escape from the camp we find a park in the center of Seoul Shin realized the film back to the 2nd of January 2005 that is when he is the only one ever escaped North Korea's Special control zone and he can't imagine it can I sit like this yes that's fine what does it look a little arrogant come on he's huh he and his friends were 20 meters from the fence then they rained Shin went first but stumbled so that the friend was the first to throw himself at the fence Shin remembers that there were sparks in a horrible stench but he climbed over the friend burned his legs terribly in the high voltage fence and continued to another world he thought his friend was closed behind him and found shelter in an empty shared in the forest but his friend never turned up Shin still doesn't know if he died in the fence or later when I think back that's the biggest sin I have committed I still feel guilty kept adding on them one but on the 3rd of January he woke up to a completely different world than the one he knew it was North Korea all right but to him the degree of freedom he found in this prison community impressed him much more than the glittery and mud in China and South Korea that he was going to see later on the most hamlet I recorded Alan here people went around freely they were wearing nice clothes I couldn't believe my own eyes it was a free society was hired on he joined up with a band of rag merchants vagabonding the deep-frozen laned a few weeks later he was at the river that separates North Korea from China Shin crossed the ice he was out of North Korea in China in South Korea there were skyscrapers TV radio computers cars and cell phones that didn't impress Shin it was just something that glittered Oh Yahoo whoa leukemia bo-chun go to my hand up shooter Politico Daniel - poor war more hungry to the Pogo hey guys you would yeah I work on my seniors on their copay where they gotta become - I didn't feel anything special when I saw that cell phones and television in China for the first time I didn't think that I want that there were just new and exciting things nothing else I repeat my only waste had already come true I had Eden and I didn't care about anything else I still feel that way I don't go in okay machine young before we say goodbye to Kong and Shin we're going to meet another victim of Kim jong-il's regime the writer can't cheol one together with his father sister and grandmother children was torn out of their home in Pyongyang and carried off to a prison camp in the mountains in a few days he was reduced from a heavy 9 years old boy to a hungry filthy little animal in a daily struggle for survival is it really possible that this can happen in the year 2008 and it's still going on you wouldn't do it's a fact many have experienced it it can't be denied I didn't even look to oilmen because he doesn't listen one theory about North Korea is that the top leader may live in his own isolated bubble maybe nobody dares to tell Kim jong-il about realities out in the real North Korea because Iran is it the sweet almond on Jeju which I'm worried what to get from the technology out there what - careful he cuts his own population off from all information but he himself has got television from all over the world it's not that he doesn't know what's going on in North Korea the brutality of his system has just grown and grown to the point where he now fears that everything will collapse and that he will suffer the same fate as Ceausescu of Romania that's why he does everything to stay in power and kill all his opponents it is easy to use a chasm Connally control one is critical toward South Korea's so-called sunshine policy towards the north Posada let's all talk nicely to each other policy you think that it may be the actual reason why Kim jong-il is still in power that and the fukui from abroad but you're unlocked food and money is sent for humanitarian reasons as humanity doesn't exist in North Korea filter but humanity does exist among common North Korean people that becomes evident as we say goodbye to shin and Cong one afternoon and so adamantine young oh uh this is to celebrate that we have met when you returned to Denmark you must never forget him and me we have been to the Namsan tower together led to calls for celebration in aah clatter thank you thank you to anything I don't forget us
