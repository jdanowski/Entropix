[Music] on today's special edition of world inside the motherland's call to arms battle spot sacrifices made fallen heroes honored a walk down memory lane in the war against u.s aggression in 8th korea holding the line [Applause] a war 70 years ago the sacrifice of tens of thousands of young lives to safeguard a new people's republic and resist aggression stories we told history we visited as the world faces a time of change war or peace world inside special on the war against the u.s aggression and aids korea the great wall was built in ancient china to defend the country from foreign invaders from the east to the west it spans a distance of 21 000 kilometers where i'm standing right here is the easternmost point of the great wall it is called the tiger mountain graze wall it was built more than 600 years ago during china's ming dynasty now this area belongs to the city of dan dong which borders the dprk in china's modern history dan dong has become an icon of struggle because of a war the war to resist the u.s aggression and aid korea there's no other place that bear witness to that part of history better than the bridge right behind me it's called the railway bridge but now it's really a broken bridge due to the aero attacks by the u.s side during the korean war the bridge only has four spans left in the middle of the yalu river they used to connect china and korea but now it only stops in the middle of the water next to the broken bridge is the china dprk friendship bridge which was also bombed during the war but it was repaired today it is busy welcoming tourist groups and transporting goods it is a good reminder of a vivid lesson the more you sweat in peace the less you bleed in wars [Music] war and peace a complicated relationship my reporting trip in dan dong where the chinese people's volunteer army crossed the yellow river 70 years ago to fight in the war has been a great reminder of its significance particularly after meeting those who fought in it and miraculously survived under extreme circumstances fanhunger is a 95 year old veteran i met fan was a sapper during the war he once studied in the esteemed huangpu military academy the cradle of chinese military talents due to the dramatic political changes in china around the time when the new people's republic was founded he joined the chinese people's liberation army before finishing his studies and volunteered for the war and ended up fighting in korea nando it's people's hope that there will not be war but peace from a historical perspective must be secured by war if china had not undertaken the war to resist u.s aggression and aid korea it would have faced a series of problems and defeated the american forces seizing this war won china prestige and starting from that time people would think twice before provoking china the peace china has enjoyed till now comes from this war but then again you can't just start an unjust war against another and sabotage peace so it's a dialectical relationship one aspect that characterized that war 70 years ago was the sharp contrast in armament and support between the chinese people's volunteer soldiers and the us-led forces it was technical and asymmetrically as a staffer fan zhu understood that well though still managed to achieve miracles you eat indomitant gun cheese one i was with the people's volunteer army corps command post for road maintenance when one morning a phone call came from one division that the enemy had dropped bombs during the night but one of them did not explode it was now lying in the middle of a road and the division hoped someone would be assigned to defuse it yoga i was the one given this assignment i heard the order and i thought you know what they should show you already no one ever taught me how to do this in school i'd never seen a bomb in real life this was a really difficult task but i didn't shirk from the duty and i accepted it with honour but when i got there lying in the middle of the road was a bomb that was about one meter long and it was really thick i recognized it was a demolition bomb not a fragmentation bomb which meant if i detonated it i would have completed the task of destroying the road that the american plane had failed to achieve blowing it up would be a horrible solution how could i complete the task of the enemy a second solution was that there was a deep ditch near the bomb i could use a rope to drag it into the ditch which was both safe and quick i was about to tell this to the division commander but decided against it if our army were to repair the road push stones down the ditch the bomb could explode and cause casualties and unsuspected local people could also be endangered when they grazed livestock this was also a bad solution so finally i decided to defuse it myself it was not a time bomb because at the front of it there was a fuse i was beyond nervous my uniform was totally soaked and i felt my hair stand up my comrades in arms stood far away holding their breath while they watched i screwed the fuse heard a click and my instinct moved backwards about two steps crawling on the ground really this was useless because if it did explode even moving back 20 steps wouldn't help let alone only two then i went back and unscrewed the fuse but i found there was another one hidden about the same length i suddenly remembered my teacher once said when the bomb crashed the ground a spring would give the second fuse force to click with the first one so i moved to get the second fuse off i handed over the two fuses each about one meter long to the division commander he held my hands and said little comrade you're so brave and your techniques are brilliant i will surely report this to our commander i was so delighted that i had completed the assignment that i jumped up and down on my way back after that incident faw hunger experienced many more life and death moments until the war ended later he and his family also went through various ups and downs and eventually settled down in dan dong the city on the border between china and korea [Music] for civilians the war that took place 70 years ago can be a lifelong scar on the banks of the yalu river i meet bee nizo he was 18 years old when the war started at the time bee was a local community policeman in dan don along the yalu river on november 8 1950 the u.s imperialists dispatched dozens of p-51 mustang heavy bombers and the b-29 heavy bombers too river bridge of the dprk this blew up the yalu river bridge and sinujo became a sea of flames because the u.s dropped so many incendiary bombs i saw some korean refugees and they jumped into the river to escape the bombing as i was patrolling the local community i thought as a policeman it is my responsibility to rescue them from the other side of the yalu river i found a big sampan right by the river from our side and i rode to the other side when i got into the sampan and rode across these refugees all piled on and i told them it won't work the boat would sink unless they boarded in an orderly way all the fishermen along the river were evacuated i was the only one to rescue them then i told them after i rescued this group of people i would come back to rescue the others so after rescuing these people onto the boat i swayed the boat back and rescue the others but there was constant bombing at that time how is it possible for you to cross the river again i didn't think about that i just knew i must go back and rescue the rest as i promised so when rowing the sampan across the river the enemy plane sprayed bullets and bombs into the river with an unmistakable bellowing roar i saw the bullets piercing the river's surface one of the refugees on the sampon was injured in the arm at the side of the sampan a man's shoulder was on fire by incendiary bombs this person seemed to know how to swim he or she jumped into the river then others helped to put out the fire what was the weather like that day the weather was very good this is a great help but we couldn't see the sun because of the smoke from the bombing the whole sky was red and darkened this is the whole process if you want to ask me about my thoughts i don't have any more ideas to be honest i just thought as a policeman that i should rescue the civilians as simple as that may occur [Music] not close to home but for the veterans and their families war is so familiar that is ingrained forever in their family history you're watching holding the line on world insight still to call the bravery to take up arms against the odds and courage under fire a panel discussion on the narratives of the war after the break this was a turning point i mean a young revolutionary government was standing up against the most powerful victorious government in the world [Applause] a war 17 years ago the sacrifice of tens of thousands of young lives to safeguard a new people's republic and resist aggression stories we told [Music] history we visited as the world faces a time of change war or peace world inside special on the war against the u.s aggression and aids korea the korean war is believed to be the forgotten war in the us in china though the war against the u.s aggression and aids korea is one of bravery and courage and the fire how do we make sense of this part of history how do we reconcile the very different narratives about this war zhao tong and inner tangent were keen to discuss them with me while sitting along the yalu river mr zhao a chinese scholar who has long followed the situation on the korean peninsula and the challenging issue of denuclearization mr tangen is a korean-american now lives in china we're sitting here on the bank of the river it's already quite chilly mid october we could imagine the lives of the chinese volunteers 70 years ago during the winter time what does this war really mean okay so this was a a turning point i mean a young revolutionary government was standing up against the most powerful victorious government in the world that was the united states and what had happened is there was great fears that what was especially on the chinese side that they did not want to repeat of the hundred years of humiliation when foreign powers and then the japanese came in and in essence was trying to control china so after having victoriously pushed the japanese out there was real concern about what macarthur's real plan was and we know today that his idea was to roll through korea through china and to his ultimate objective which was to take on russia there was this real feeling among people like him that you know the u.s had been pulled into two consecutive world wars and that the only way to prevent this from happening was to literally conquer the entire world there was no plan on how that would work out but there was this kind of euphoria that somehow democracy and capitalism would just overtake everything and everyone would be happy and as we've seen subsequently it doesn't work that way there are a lot of historical records coming out from various sites china russia the united states korea to korea in fact that there are disputed facts but even in spite of that this is a very significant war for all so what do you make of this war the war the china fight against the us aggression to aid korea i think this war really introduced cold war to the eastern asia previously the american attention was on europe and this war fundamentally shaped the economic political and geostrategic landscape of north east asia it deeply shaped china it deeply shaped china's u.s bilateral relationship it also raised china's status in the socialist bloc and i think this war really affected this region even more than half century later after the war ended today this region is still the last land in the world where the cold war still remains china's war against u.s aggression to eight korea it was a hot debate in china i mean at least among the top leadership whether to go to war or not mr zhao i know you've been studying some historical records before coming here and this is one of your subjects tell me more about what's the nature of that debate i think uh to me uh it's it was a really challenging decision from the chinese top leaders at that time their priority is to advance chinese national interests china has now been fully reunified china needs to unify taiwan china needs to liberate tibet china also needs to stabilize the internal economic and social situation also china is a country that just fought the japanese for eight years went through a long civil war and the chinese people didn't want to go to war they want to build the country the new china so initially i think the chinese leaders had no appetite to go into war but north korea and south korea they started war in june and even though north korea made initial quick progress but quickly after the american landed in incheon the overall situation was turned over americans across the 38th parallel moved all the way to the chinese border it's reported that chinese border was also bombed by american aircraft so there was growing concern that if this situation continued china's own territory could be threatened by the united states so facing that immediate threat i think chinese leaders made an important decision to help the north koreans and resist americans we've been trying to interview as early on program indicates some veterans the area where we're sitting right here have been severely bombed by the u.s aero attacks repeatedly during that time and some of them were trying to help some koreans to cross the river in order to seek a safer hub but of course the personal saga is one thing but strategically this has been changing a lot of things one of the things that we have seen over the past 70 years is people's increasing interest in finding out what really happened starting from the battlefield to the strategies to the personalities it was being termed as a forgotten war in the us why was it because we weren't successful i mean the idea was we had the most powerful military machine we had won the second world war and as i said before general macarthur had this kind of sweeping vision um i think there was a racial component in this while the u.s had battled the japanese and earned a lot of respect for them because of the fierceness and willingness to sacrifice that they showed for some reason he didn't think that that applied to china and he thought it would be easy to push through china on his way to russia and i think he was very much surprised as was everyone else at the willingness to do what was necessary to make sacrifices even though it was an asymmetrical war the united states a military machine when it finally got in to busan and these areas we had tanks we had aircraft we have everything that was necessary to really propel war but even with that we were only able to get in essence a stalemate to push it back to the 38th parallel which was the original agreement between the us and russia as to the division of of korea so at that point you know what can you celebrate at that point it's it's uh things but it became a kind of a model unfortunately having failed once then vietnam came there after and there was this kind of idea hardening between ideologies after that you know you had people like mccarthy and senator joe mccarthy saying that anybody who thought about socialism or communism was an enemy of the u.s state and there was a hardening also in communist states where they thought that there were perhaps fifth columns that were trying to destabilize these societies who were just one hard-fought freedom just by the way we know that the records coming from the u.s side was once open to public but since the bush administration once again classified so we would not have access to most of these facts anymore at least about the u.s side talking about the chinese side over the years and decades people look at that war with different angles at the very beginning of the reform and opening up when china is getting now stronger and when china and the u.s are in a very interesting period of time for example right now mr zhao how do you see this evolving perception about this war well i think this war made u.s and china 20 years enemies previously u.s was trying to cut china but after china signed this alliance agreement with the soviet union i thought that started before because the people's republic was founded and the usa was pretty much on the taiwan issue with china it's a very big division right but i think the u.s still had hope that at least china could maintain neutral between soviet union and united states but as the korean war started immediately this red threats became a real concern to the united states they worry that communism would spread further not only overtake the korean peninsula but even spread expand further into other parts of this region so it started to see china as a key pillar as china sends volunteer army into korea as a key peter in the socialist communist bloc so that really characterized china-u.s relationship for many years afterwards but over time i think this korean war also sold some seeds in the improvement of u.s china relationship uh korean war showed some disagreements between china and the soviet union and as soviet union later became a greater threat to china mao zedong made the decision to work closer with the united states to hedge against soviet rights so u.s china relationship improved and today i think the two sides were able to gradually know better about each other they were able to look at this troublesome history with patients and with sympathy i think they still have different interpretations of what happened but now i think they could build upon that and look beyond um so i think it's um it's fortunate that u.s china were able to escape this cold war relationship but korea is still trapped in in this co-work mentality and still haven't uh improved its relationship with united i would argue the other way around that there is still a lesson to be learned from that period of time you know with the us's sailing ships through the taiwan straits disputing almost every single the four corners of china in terms of tibet xinjiang hong kong taiwan in addition to the south china seas you know you you feel almost like you're back to this point where there's so many strategic assumptions being made that are wrong that you know somehow china will fold or that you can make china become something which it isn't i mean 40 years of success for china when everybody you know the economist intelligence unit and many others were forecasting every year that it was about to fall this has really uh you know kind of solidified this idea that somehow uh china is still somehow inferior to the us and that's not that's not the case if there's going to be a multilateral uh world multi-polar there has to be this understanding that different peoples can take the same different paths to success and prosperity and this is you just don't see that [Applause] a war seventy years ago the sacrifice of tens of thousands of young lives to safeguard a new people's republic and resist aggression stories retold history resistance as the world faces a time of change war or peace world inside special on the war against the u.s aggression and aids korea this is a war enormous amount of lives were lost from the chinese side from the korean side both north and south and from the u.s side there are disputing numbers at this moment coming from all sides saying how many lives they lost and how many lives are lost by the other side but certainly for sure enormous so now in retrospect when we look at this war and the young lives younger than you right now sitting here younger than me in their early 20s all of them it's actually quite surreal to me sitting on the same riverbank once they wore during the war well it's it's um same to me um you know i think as as more we reflect upon the war and its charities not only to the troops in war but also to the civilians you know we increasingly appreciate the cruelty of war and increasingly determined to prevent another war another actually positive impact of the korean war is it's offered an opportunity for u.s china's two big powers to really understand each other they understand each other's resolve they understand the risks and the consequences of testing each other's red lines and misinterpreting the others aim yes the the the risks of misunderstanding but also they understand that both strong people with strong resolve you cannot challenge them they do not bend over pressure so i think that offered a foundation for more stable bilateral relation that's why i think u.s would be willing to improve relations with china later because it knew that china is a competent competent country nation it can depend on china so it paved the ground for more stable yeah but at this point you know the lessons of history are not being observed by people like pompeo and trump i mean they are really pushing all the red lines and and this is what is so disquieting about this whole situation when you start talking about casualties we know that at least three million people died during that war and so many pows too two million civilians uh both total north and south about equal numbers uh were brutally uh these were brutal atrocities families were taken out to the ditch and the the father the mother and the children were shot and their bodies left in the drainage dish and this happened on both sides this is an example that war does not solve anything it just creates tragedies but why aren't these lessons being remembered now it seems that china remembers these much better than our newest crop of people who believe that they can impose a kind of world order on people who are not willing during the war many battles have become well-known battles in modern military history despite of the fact this is a war many people regretted today so what about the first three battles it seems that the chinese volunteer troops were having easy victories relatively speaking but then it became much more challenging many say this is a asymmetrical war because of logical support and power between china us mr zhao what do you make of it i think china made great efforts to make sure that you know china could present a surprise to the american troops um you know chinese decision makers really emphasize the importance of quickly deploying troops into korea you know some troops were shipped by train all the way from southern china fujian province all the way to the border and they passed in the northeastern provinces where supplies warm clothes were already prepared but they couldn't have time to stop the train and pick up the supplies that's how much the how much effort they made to to surprise americans and that made an impact i think the us was not expecting chinese troops there they really underestimate chinese resolve and even if the fault was already the u.s decision makers thought china was only there to self-defend it was you know a small number of chinese troops but in fact it was a much larger scale so basically china was able to quickly knock over the u.s off balance and by the end of the second campaign the u.s and south korean troops were pushed beyond the 38th parallel and by the end of third campaign chinese and north korean armies were able to retake seoul so that was a very quick success but after the chinese troops moved to the south part of the korean peninsula the logistic line became too loud to maintain the americans they occupy you know complete uh dominance in the air so the logistic line was heavily bombed so china has to um know spent a lot of efforts defending that line that you know distracted the chinese troops on the front line and also the the heavy you know the very cold weather the chinese troops were wearing not warm enough clothes it's hard for them to fight with americans who are very well supplied so i think the u.s literally was able to gradually stop chinese uh moving forward and the two sides entered into a stalemate for a long time around two years it's about war and negotiation going on at the same time that was quite a strenuous efforts from both sides isn't it yeah it was and unfortunately the people who were paying the price uh were the civilians and the troops on both sides um you know what was accomplished at the beginning it was at the 38th parallel and at the end it was at the 38th parallel that's why it's the forgotten war in the united states but for china to actually be able to push back and hold its own was a very very important first this is you know the test of a new government whether they would be able to protect their own not only internally but also externally against what they perceive to be an aggressive power and of course that is the only land conflict between china and the u.s forces in this century so it's a very interesting case study having said that though another interesting phenomenon many scholars study today is about the personalities of generals of both sides of the u.s side first of all is mr mike cothler and then mr ridgeway and then for the uh chinese side it's of course general pong de why a very a person with a lot of personality should we put it that way and straightforward guy so how do you see this the studies and different versions of you know these historical figures i i see it unfortunately as a number of missteps i mean ridgeway was a professional soldier he was the one who basically cleaned up the mess macarthur made by uh basically he thought that the chinese wouldn't do anything that he could push through to the yalu river that they were going to mop up uh the north koreans and then they were going to be on their way to moscow so you know despite the fact that his commander-in-chief told him not to do it sent him a missive beforehand the cia misinformed him and said look don't worry about the chinese they're not ready or prepared and little did he know that they were so initially yes china had the element of surprise they came in and macarthur didn't know what to do he had to finally admit that he had exceeded he had lost his footing as we said and at that point they had to bring in other people to kind of put this thing in check in the end he retired quote as a hero but this was definitely the first big blemish on his military career all soldiers never died just to fade away that of course it's a well-known quote coming from mr mike gasser having said that though mr zhao what about mr pong do why well mr pong you know he is a loyal good soldier he was basically directly asked by chairman mao zodon to lead the volunteer army he was not prepared but he just took the order and did his job very well very well so and he was very decisive in commanding the troops if his bolognese made mistakes he would fail them immediately and he also fought fiercely with his own superiors and colleagues to get necessary supplies for his troops and soldiers he really loved his soldiers and therefore he insisted on supplies first yes and therefore he won respect and love back from his own soldiers and because of his well performance a good performance in the war he was quickly tapped to become china's next national defense minister and of course those figures are historical figures but they are only appearing these days in history so that's why at the end of our conversation sitting in a quiet corner along the yalu river enjoying our moment of peace during the weekend how do you see war visa be peace that's a question i always want to find out some answers about at least during this trip mr tangent you're going to end up going to war if you forget the lessons of history it's arrogance it's um you know not understanding exactly what it is that's going on on the other side and i really feel that there's an existential threat or at least perceived threat on behalf of a lot of developed countries because they have they have capitalism and democracy and they see china's success with a different system as this kind of existential threat and it shouldn't be that way as i've said there are many paths to prosperity let each country figure out its own oh for me you know sitting here in mid october i already felt very cold only after half an hour or so i cannot imagine how the soldiers fought in heavy snow in environments of 30 degrees minus zero centigrade and so many soldiers were frozen to death so it's definitely we should do everything to avoid the war and we should remember the war introduced cold war into east asia and today i think people were talking about another new cold war between us and china i think this is the right time for us to reflect upon history and learn lessons to avoid another costly new cold war well said from both of you thank you for doing so much research about this war and talking to us and thank you for being here so that we will be able to get the history much closer to us in order to find out exactly what happened and in order to learn the real lessons inner tangent zhao tong really appreciate it thank you thank you for having me thank you and that leads us to the end of this special edition of our program here on the bank of the yalu river on the war against the u.s aggression to aid korea during peace times sons bury their fathers during war times fathers bury their sons the biggest tragedy of human being of course and we do not want them to be repeated once again i'm ten wei on behalf of my team here in dan dong and in beijing thank you for watching see you tomorrow you
