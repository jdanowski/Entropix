LATEST FROM WASHINGTON  >> REPORTER: PRESIDENT TRUMP  STEPPING UP RHETORIC TOWARDS  NORTH KOREA. >> LET'S SEE WHAT HE DOES WITH  GUAM. HE DOES SOMETHING IN GUAM, IT  WILL BE AN EVENT THE LIKES OF  WHICH NOBODY HAS SEEN BEFORE  WHAT WILL HAS BEEN IN NORTH  KOREA. HE WILL SEE. NOT A DARE, IT IS A STATEMENT. HE IS NOT GOING AROUND  THREATENING GUAM AND UNITED  STATES AND JAPAN. HE IS NOT GOING TO THREATEN  SOUTH KOREA. >> REPORTER: PRESIDENT ADDRESSED REPORTERS THURSDAY AT HIS GOLF  CLUB IN NEW JERSEY. >> HE HAS DISRESPECTED OUR  COUNTRY GREATLY AND SAID THINGS  THAT ARE HORRIFIC. HE GOT AWAY WITH IT BETWEEN HIM  AND HIS FAMILY. IT IS A WHOLE NEW BALL GAME. >> REPORTER: RESPONDING TO  CONCERNS HIS FIRE AND FURY  THREAT TOO INFLAMMATORY. SOME SAY HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN  STRONGER. >> MAYBE IT WASN'T TOUGH ENOUGH. >> REPORTER: HE IS NOT BACKING  DOWN. HE IS NOT SAYING WHAT IS NEXT. ONE REPORTER ASKED ABOUT A  PRE-EMPTIVE STRIKE. TRUMP SAID HE WOULDN'T DISCUSS  HIS PLANS. >> WE DON'T TALK ABOUT THAT, I  NEVER DO. >> ON THE GROUND IN NORTH KOREA. MARCHING ON THE STREETS IN  SUPPORT OF STRIKING GUAM. IN NEW JERSEY PRESIDENT HAD  FINAL WARNING. >> NORTH KOREA BETTER GET THEIR  ACT TOGETHER OR THEY ARE GOING  TO BE IN TROUBLE LIKE FEW  NATIONS HAVE BEEN IN TROUBLE,  OKAY. >> REPORTER: U.S. COMMITTED TO  DIPLOMACY AND WAITING TO SEE IF  NORTH KOREA FOLLOWS THROUGH ON  ITS THREAT. IN WASHINGTON, CBN NEWS. >> KIM JONG UN'S THREAT TO  ATTACK GUAM HAS WASHINGTON UP IN ARMS. HOW ARE THE PEOPLE OF GUAM  REACTING TO THAT THREAT? PRESIDENT OF PACIFIC ISLANDS  UNIVERSITY, CHRISTIAN SCHOOL IN  GUAM. JOINS US FOR MORE. MR. MORELL, HOW ARE THE LEADERS  REACTING TO THIS THREAT BY NORTH KOREA'S THREAT? >> OUR GOVERNOR JUST SPOKE AND I THINK EXPRESSES WHAT I SEE AS  THE COMMON ATTITUDE, PEOPLE ARE  PRETTY CALM. THIS IS A PLACE THAT HAS SEEN  WAR AND VARIOUS TURN OVER  BEFORE. PRETTY CALM GROUP OF PEOPLE. >> WHAT ABOUT CHRISTIAN  MISSIONARIES IN GUAM, ANY TALK  OF EVACUATION? EVACUATING THESE FOLKS AT THIS  POINT? >> I HAVE NOT HEARD ANY. I AM A MEMBER OF A SMALL MISSION IN THE UNITED STATES AS OR SOME  OF THE PEOPLE I WORK WITH. WE HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH OUR  LEADERSHIP. THEY HAVE ENCOURAGED US TO TAKE  SENSIBLE PRECAUTIONS. WE HAVE TRIED TO REASSURE PEOPLE BACK IN THE UNITED STATES THAT  WE ARE, WE ARE WELL. I WOULD SAY IT IS QUITE LIKELY  THAT YOU ARE IN GREATER DANGER  DRIVING ON THE INTERSTATE THAN I AM HERE IN GUAM. MY WIFE AND I ARE ON A SHORT  VACATION. BUSINESS IS GOING ON AS USUAL. >> ON THAT NOTE, HOW IS THE  CHURCH REACTING TO ALL THIS? ANY CALLS FOR PRAYER? CHURCHES GETTING INVOLVED IN  THIS SITUATION? >> WELL, YES, ACTUALLY, I MET  WITH A COUPLE OF PASTORS  THURSDAY MORNING, PRAYER MEETING THAT I TRY TO GO TO WHENEVER I  AM ABLE. WE ACTUALLY SPENT TIME IN PRAYER FOR THE SITUATION IN KOREA AND  THE THREATS GOING ON. SEVERAL CONGREGATIONS IN GUAM  PREDOMINANTLY KOREAN. IN FACT, SEVERAL OF THEM CONDUCT THEIR SERVICES IN KOREAN. IT HAS A FAR GREATER IMPACT ON  THEM. MOST OF THEM HAVE A FAMILY,  FRIENDS, LOVED ONES IN THE  KOREAN PENINSULA. ALSO TO REFOCUS THINGS, I THINK  RATHER THAN WE FOCUSSING ON A  DANGER PROBABLY IS NOT GOING TO  COME TO PASS. FAR GREATER FOCUS FOR PRAYER  SHOULD BE THE PEOPLE OF NORTH  KOREA WHO LIVE UNDER OPPRESSIVE  REGIME, GOSPEL IS HINDERED AND  GOING FORWARD. MISSIONARIES HAVE BEEN JAILED  THERE. SO AS WE ARE INSTRUCTED IN 1  TIMOTHY 2, WE SHOULD PRAY FOR  THOSE IN LEADERSHIP THAT PEOPLE  MIGHT BE ABLE TO LIVE IN PEACE  AND CALM SO THAT THE GOSPEL WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO FORTH UNHINDERED. SO I THINK RATHER THAN MAKING  THE FOCUS WE PEOPLE THAT ARE  UNDER THREAT SO CALLED, WE  SHOULD FOCUS OUR PRAYER ON THOSE PEOPLE WE KNOW THAT ARE  SUFFERING BECAUSE OF THE  OPPRESSIVE REGIME IN NORTH  KOREA. >> ABSOLUTELY, WELL SAID  MR. MOREL, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US FROM GUAM, THANK YOU FOR  JOINING US, APPRECIATE IT. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. JEN  >> GOVERNMENT RELEASED CHRISTIAN PASTOR FROM PRISON. FREED FOR HEALTH REASONS. HE HAD BEEN JAILED SINCE 2015  SERVING A LIFE SENTENCE FOR  USING RELIGION TO DESTROY THE  NORTH KOREAN SYSTEM. PASTOR AT HIS CHURCH SAID  PARISHIONERS WERE SO HAPPY THEY  COULD BARELY BELIEVE THE NEWS. >>> UP NEXT, GRAVE GROUP OF  CHRISTIANS SENDING THE GOSPEL  INTO NORTH KOREA AND UNDERGROUND CHURCH THAT IS FIGHTING TO  SURVIVE. >> WELCOME BACK TO "CHRISTIAN  WORLD NEWS." WE ALSO WANT TO  WELCOME OUR FACEBOOK VIEWERS  FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD TO THIS  SEGMENT. SO GLAD YOU ARE WITH US. WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO POST YOUR COMMENTS AND PRAYERS. WE ARE GETTING TO THOSE IN A FEW MINUTES. >> WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT  NORTH KOREA. GROWING THREAT TO THE WORLD. IT HAS ALWAYS OPPRESSED OWN  CITIZENS, CHRISTIANS IN THE  COUNTRY BELIEVING IN GOD COULD  TAKE ACTIONS. HERE IS AN EXCLUSIVE LOOK AT THE OPERATION. >> JUST BEFORE SUNSET, A VAN  LOAD OF CHRISTIANS FROM SEOUL  HEADS NORTH. WE CANNOT SHOW YOU THEIR FACES  OR REVEAL THEIR NAMES. >> WHAT WE ARE DOING COULD GET  US IN TROUBLE. >> WHERE ARE WE GOING TODAY? WE ARE GOING HERE SOME FOUR  MILES FROM NORTH KOREAN BORDER  AND CLOSE TO DEMILITARIZED ZONE. >> DMZ IS ONE OF THE MOST  HEAVILY FORTIFIED AND  POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS PLACES ON  EARTH. >> WE'LL WAIT AT THE TOP OF THE  STAIRS, SIR. ONE MILLION ARMED NORTH KOREA  TROOPS STAND READY ON THE DMZ. SOUTH HAS JUST AS MANY. >> ONE FACTOR THAT COULD RUIN  THIS WHOLE THING IS THE WEATHER. >> ONE SLIGHT CHANGE IN THE  WEATHER COULD MESS UP THE  OPERATION. >> PETER DUBBED THIS OPERATION  DANDY LION. >> WE STARTED THIS PROJECT IN  1991. JUST AS A DANDY LION NEEDS WIND  TO SPREAD SEEDS, WE NEED THE  WIND TO SPREAD SEEDS. >> THAT IS PRINTED IN KOREAN  LANGUAGE THOUSANDS OF BRIGHT  ORANGE BALLOONS. >> USING BALLOONS IS THE MOST  EFFECTIVE WAYS TO SHARE THE  GOSPEL. >> TANK IN THE BACK OF THE VAN  PUMPS HELIUM INTO THE BALLOONS.

SCRIPTURES ON THE BALLOONS MEANT TO ENCOURAGE THEM. >> ERNEST PRAYERS BEGIN HERE AT  AN UNDISCLOSED LOCATION, EVERY  YEAR SINCE 1991, THEY HAVE BEEN  PREPARING EACH BALLOON FOR THE  FLIGHT INTO NORTH KOREA. >> I WAS BORN IN NORTH KOREA. THIS IS MY WAY OF HELPING THE  GOSPEL BACK TO MY COUNTRYMEN. >> THIS IS HOW IT WORKS, THEY  HAVE A HOLE IN HERE, THEY FILL  HELIUM, TAPE AROUND IT AND OFF  IT GOES INTO THE SKIES OF NORTH  KOREA. >> HELIUM WILL LEAK OUT OF THE  BALLOON AND EVENTUALLY FALL TO  THE GROUND. WHEN SOMEONE PICKS IT UP, THEY  WILL BE ABLE TO RED ALL 16  CHAPTERS OF THE BOOK OF MARK. >> PETER USED BOATS TO LUNCH  BALLOON OFFENSIVE FROM THE SEA. IN ADDITION TO THE BALLOON  OPERATION, PETER'S GROUP  ORGANIZES A WEEKLY RADIO  BROADCAST THEN TRANSLATED INTO  FREQUENCIES INTO NORTH KOREA. >> NORTH KOREAN GOVERNMENT TRIES TO JAM OUR SIGNAL. WE HAVE OTHER METHODS. >> THIS IS WHAT MOTIVATE IT IS  TEAM. CBN NEWS OBTAINED EXCLUSIVE  PHOTOGRAPHS OF SECRET  UNDERGROUND CHURCH MEETINGS IN  NORTH KOREA. WHEN A NORTH KOREAN ACCEPTS  JESUS CHRIST, THEY FACE  PERSECUTION AND EVEN DEATH  BECAUSE OF THEIR FAITH. ALLEGEDLY SHOWING EXECUTION OF  NORTH KOREAN CHRISTIANS.

TODAY WIND LOCATIONS HAVE BEEN  GOOD. >> OFTEN WE HAVE TO WAIT. PEOPLE'S LIVES ARE ON THE WAY. WE'LL CONTINUE UNTIL NORTH KOREA IS FREE AND CHRISTIANS CAN  WORSHIP JESUS CHRIST. >> SO AMAZING, DO THEY HAVE HOPE ONE DAY THEY WILL CHANGE? >> ABSOLUTELY THEY BELIEVE IN  JESUS CHRIST AND HAVE HOPE. THEY HAVE CHOSEN TO AND THE ON  THE WALLS OF NORTH KOREA AND  PRAY FOR THE HOLY SPIRIT TO COME AND IMPACT THIS KINGDOM. THEY ARE BELIEVING AND I BELIEVE IT AND PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD  ARE PRAYING LIKE NEVER BEFORE  FOR NORTH KOREA. >> AND SOUTH KOREANS ARE PUTTING THEIR LIVES AT RISK. DO THEY EVER GET FEEDBACK? >> THROUGH THE RADIO BROADCAST,  DEFECTORS WHO COME OUT OF THE  COUNTRY AND SECRETLY GO IN AND  OUT. IT IS DIFFICULT. VERIFICATION IS A BIG ISSUE. THERE IS A BOMBARDMENT OF THE  GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ON THIS  KINGDOM. ONE DAY, WALLS OF JERICHO AROUND THIS NATION ARE GOING TO FALL. WHETHER IT IS A CONFLICT, SOME  SUPER NATURAL MOVE, THOSE WALLS  ARE GOING TO COME DOWN BECAUSE  OF THE PRAYERS OF THE BELIEVERS. >> AMEN.
