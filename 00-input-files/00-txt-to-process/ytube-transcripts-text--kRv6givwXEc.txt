the Joe Rogan experience interesting what else should we be concerned with which would be concerned with anything that North Korea's doing oh absolutely sorry I have spent a lot of time in North Korea yes why I brought it yeah so I've advised the North Korea actually no working North Korean government on the establishment of special economic zones which I certainly believe if North Korea could have economic growth and integrate into the rest of the world that would be great it so I've I - you will know this was in 2015 yeah but I've been there twice across the border from China and zigzag the country by land visited 10 or 12 different sites so spent almost two weeks by lands I've really incredible I mean North Korea won it's the most organized place I've ever seen I mean there's not as any where there's like on the side of the road the the stones are all raked there's not a stick every little line is drawn it's like total control there were very in them in the agricultural areas there were very few machines and very few farm animal so I saw people pulling plows like you know usually have that the animal in front of the plow and the person behind here there were like two people in front of the plow and one person behind the people were the the the animals and we would go and visit these just because they didn't they a lot of animals got eaten when they had their family and so we visited these different sites for these special economic zones and they would say like what they had done and what they were thinking about doing and I would say like how do you do you know anything about the market like do you what are you going to sell here and they said well we know about clearing land and building a fence and then we we went to to Pyongyang and I spoke to about 400 economic planners and I said look I know you have these plans that to do these special economic zones it's totally going to fail the way it's going to work you have to connect to the market economy you have to empower your workers you need information flow how else are you going to learn and adapt so North Korea it's a really dangerous place and now it's even more dangerous because President Trump through it was this kind of nonsensical Hail Mary it needs these meetings with Kim jong-un never any indication that the North Koreans were planning on giving up their nuclear weapons they never said they would it's the last thing they would do because their goal is survival and so there was this kind of head-fake which was like a PR stunt to be able to say art we're having these these meetings and of course the North Koreans weren't ever going to give up their nuclear weapons they're still not so now things are ramping up so North Korea in the last couple of days has started firing missiles again the United States today MC US military seized a North Korean ship so we're going back to this very dangerous place and and so I think we really need to do a much better job we need much more consider North Korea it's really hard and these guys are really smart I mean I they are they are very easy people say well these guys are poor they must not be so mean to like it med like that we're playing cards with them we've got the whole deck they don't have it have one card and yet they're there they're in the game they're holding us to it to a stalemate and it's really worrying and why did you go over there like what yeah what were you thinking so I thought a lot about it because I have a background in human rights I was a human rights officer for the United Nations in Cambodia I'm the child of a refugee I have this very strong belief in human rights and that in supporting people and North Korea they have about a hundred and twenty thousand people in the most beautiful brutal horrific prison camps and so when I was asked to be part of this six person delegation advising them on the special on the establishment of special economic zones one instinct was screw them I don't want to be part of this at all but I also felt that if North Korea could have some kind of integrated economic development that would at least connect them to the world that would create some kind of leverage and that would that would help help people so I decided to go and I'm glad that I that I did but if this is these really hard artists people and it's very unfortunate that in in president Trump's negotiations with the North Koreans human rights was never once mentioned and I think that that's coming back to values like we have to be clear about who we are and what we stand for and be consistent and fighting for it do you think that Trump didn't bring that up because he wanted to be able to effectively communicate with them and not put them on their heels maybe but I feel like has had they done anything that if he thought that there was a real chance of progress but the hard thing was he didn't know much about the North Koreans he has people we have brilliant people working in the United States government and all of those people all of the US intelligence agencies were telling President Trump that the North Koreans have absolutely no intention of giving up their nuclear weapons right and so maybe he did think that he would charm Kim jong-un or he would say hey we're gonna give you economic development or whatever but I think for most people who were observers of North who had watched it for I thought that was not so we gave away a lot so we didn't mention human rights we suspended our military exercises we gave them the legitimacy of a presidential meeting which they've been wanting for thirty years and we didn't get anything back so it had we gotten something back then you could say well that was a risk for a taking maybe mmm yeah I haven't heard described that way but I'm agreeing with what you're saying what do you think he could have done differently though I don't think the meeting should have happened with no no no conditions there were no peace so if he had said I'm open to meet with the North Koreans which is something the North Koreans have always won and we could have met with the North Koreans any time immediately for the last 30 years but in order to do it they need to do this this and this and if they do it will meet like that would have been a legitimate thing but what he said is somebody the the North Korean I mean sorry the the South Korean national security viruses peeked into his office and he goes they they want to meet and it was like sure that seems like an interesting thing to do and I think that with this diplomacy you kind of have to get something and so we gave away so much up front and the North Koreans weren't didn't have an incentive to do anything in return was his perspective that it would be better to be in communication to be with this guy who's that what I would be but we have real interests in the sense that we we have large military forces in Seoul we have a lot at stake we have our closest ally Japan who had citizens abducted and so I think that was what he thought is like let's be friendly and then with the the force of personal chemistry and everything will will unlock but I think that was always extremely unlikely what do you think is gonna happen to that country I think eventually and I've written this I think eventually this regime will will collapse under its own weight but it's really held out a long time because you think of the collapse of the Soviet Union they had another Soviet Union it had enough bullets to survive if they had said you know we're just gonna shoot everybody at the Berlin Wall and every dissenter they would still be the North Korea has essentially murdered millions of people so with famine and execution and and and and prison camps so I think they're gonna stay for a while but eventually there will be leaders in North Korea who will come to the conclusion that it's safer to oppose the Kim family than to wait for the Kim family to come and get you and that tends to happen in these kind of totalitarian systems where there's so little trust there's so little loyalty Jesus yeah now what is there what are the conditions like technologically like what was their infrastructure like so the general infrastructure is absolutely terrible I mean they have roads in the big cities that are actually quite nice roads because there's no cars and so but their infrastructure is is terrible I mean all their their power supply they they have brownouts blackouts all the time their manufacturing is all being decimated so it's terrible but they have really focused their energy on building these nuclear weapons because they think that these nuclear weapons give them leverage to do things and to extract concessions and to get to get a bit it's terrible infrastructure so dude they don't have an internet right but they have something similar but it only allows them access to a few state-run websites well average person does have access to the internet so the way it works is it's all about loyalty so you need three or so generations of loyalty to the Kim family to even set foot in Pyongyang the capital so really yes so it's not like you can kind of move around or whatever it's like just to be in the capital like you have to have your loyalty proven and so average person out in the country they don't have access to much of anything they have a little bit more now than they did in the past and then for this relatively small number of elites who are in largely in Pyongyang and in the other cities which are like there there's a ring of defense around these cities and just to enter you have to have all of these checks some of them have access to limited internet but it's it's tightly controlled and it's not like you're kind of going on Google and look going wherever you want right they and they probably would get in trouble if they googled the wrong thing yes and trouble it's not just you trouble like if you trouble if if my brother or my uncle does something that gets me in trouble with the regime the whole extended family is out and that means you either you go to prison camps or you're kicked out of Pyongyang I mean if this it's all about collective punishment people are terrified and by that ruthless punishment structure that they've set up that's how they've kept control of the country yes and everybody's forced to rat on each other right yes absolutely yeah yeah they're they're they're actually they're compelled you know tell on each other for one thing that you did if you don't then what if you don't then you are complicit because they yes so that's and that's they're these horrible stories I've met a lot of these of these people who are in the prison camps like I have a friend of mine and she was this 13 year old girl and her father was a like a low-level North Korean official and then he was accused of something and so this family that was privileged all of a sudden was was out and you know just just these horrible things and prison and rape and this little I mean now she's in the United States an incredibly positive and it's amazing how resilient she is but this is like a real hell and it's a real issue and I think that for us as Americans as humans we're less human when there are people who are suffering like this yeah I agree now you were traveling all over North Korea but what were they having you do so we would do is we would go from one of these special economic zones to the other and in each one it was kind of the same story you'd get there there'd be like a big field the farmers had been kicked off there was a fence around it and then the group of the local officials would come and they'd have like a big chart and they have a plan like here's where we're gonna build this building and here's and I would always ask the same question like what are you gonna do here why do you think you're going to be competitive how do you know what the market prices are how are your workers going to be empowered so they can change things I mean in the old days it used to be you just kind of have these automaton workers now workers are actually making big decisions and fixing things and they didn't have an answer to any of those questions and that's what happens when you have these totalitarian top-down systems is that like if you being creative is actually really dangerous so if somebody says do X you just do X Wow ya know I think it's really incredible and it's it's so sad because I spend a lot of time in South Korea and this is the most dynamic place there's like I often I go to Seoul just to see what technology is going to show up here a few years in the future minutes it Seoul is like the future and then just 35 miles from Seoul is the Demilitarized Zone on the other side it's it's incredible and the real problem would be once they finally did get free of that community or of that that that mean you can call them whatever you want dictator and that his family what would they what tools would they have like how prepared would they be to be our tongue yes well it's really the good thing the benefit that they have if there is so here's my thought of what a scenario of the scenario might look like amazing eventually probably there'll be some kind of coup attempt against the Kim field let's just say it succeeds but that would probably result in another military dictatorship with another group well we don't know because then I think immediately I think the Chinese would invade really yeah because people think of the Kirwin people think of the Korean war from the early 1950s they think oh it's the Korean War it must have been the Americans fighting against the the Koreans but the Korean War the two sides was America and the South Koreans fighting against the North Koreans and the Chinese the Chinese did the most of the of the of the fighting and so China North Korea is the only country in the world that has a treaty alliance with China kind of like we have with Japan and within with South Korea and so China their biggest fear is having a reunified Korean Peninsula will allied to the United States I think if there was a coup the Chinese would immediately move in militarily then immediately there would be this call to have some kind of UN body and there would be a call for a UN Authority and then I think it would be agreed that the Chinese would stay and they just would put on blue helmets like as a UN force and then we'd have to negotiate what happens next and I think what the Chinese would do would be say well we'll leave when the Americans leave is that I think that would be what will likely happen but eventually I think we're going to see a Korean reunification and the good news of these reunified countries like East and West Germany is there's a whole system of law that is just use this North Korea will be swallowed into South Korea and then you have law you have an infrastructure and it'll take you know one or two generations but I think that will eventually happen and I'm hoping it can happen without nuclear war terrible terrible bloodshed but it's it's gonna be a big challenge it's god damn yeah that sounds insurmountable yes hearing you talk about that about North Korea getting absorbed by South Korea I'm like oh my god yes look [Applause]
