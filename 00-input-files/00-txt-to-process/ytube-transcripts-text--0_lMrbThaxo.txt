so recently 10 people and got publicly executed in haryong another border town and nine people had a public attire and sent to political prison camp and all those people related 19 people sent to political prison camps with them and i think that's where kim jong is reaching right now that he is reaching this break point that people is not going to be able to tolerate this even longer because their life is on the line and who can survive in that in that country right now without anything coming from outside the country while the regime is not providing anything to the people [Music] hi guys welcome to my channel my name is yami park i'm a north skin defector human rights activist i sometimes like today i've been talking to some podcasts and other things and really made me energizing the news from north korea and being in this two different universe and i always thought about myself as being a bridge between the freeward and and the hermit kingdom and the news are so different the the reality that i see every day here is uh it's a paradise and the reality that my people are facing every single day is like absolute hell and sometimes like i have a hard time to like reconcile that difference like how is this even the same word it's just like am i in this 21st century even what century like am i in so the news that i got from north korea is a mass mobilization of like a public execution in march earlier this month uh in recent years widow covey north korea have kind of stopped executing people at once altogether they used to do that more in the past but you know they have kind of like it came on easy on it because it was hard to raise more people bring them in the same like you know stadium or market would be wouldn't be that safe and i think kim jong-un like is really understanding right now there are so many people are not happy with the current system and he's really trying his last i think trying to show what the consequences of not following the rule that he set up to his citizens to follow so recently 10 people and got publicly executed in another border town and nine people had a public attire and sent to political prison camp and all those people relating 19 people send to political prison camps with them so the number is going to be way bigger than that the once the total senate prison camps the reason why kim jong-un were executing these people is again i talked about in the last video how kim jong has been banning the smuggling with the china because he thinks the products that nursing people bring might contain like copied virus then he doesn't want that and this is another thing about it like people in north korea average citizens they do not die from coronavirus the chances of them killed by chronovirus is way way lower than carried by starvation of course the chances for kim jong-un to die from carnivores is like higher because nothing else to carry him there and that's why you know only the rich people can afford to have a complete lockdown and the poor people cannot afford to have this insane lockdown that kim jong is forcing onto every citizen in north korea and this is like a wise sub setting to me it's not like who wants to die from virus like we all want to be safe but only when we have the privilege to be locked down the people in north korea they cannot survive without smuggling because as i keep saying the government salary do not even let them be alive in one day with that money and everybody gotta break the rules to survive so when these the smugglers were doing this business they had to get her from the elite otherwise how they owners crossing these highly electrified fire fences and land the mines going to china and bring what they from brought china is even shocking they literally brought some rice soy um soy oil and like grocery materials from china because nothing was in the north korean market a lot of people don't understand like when i go to like costco or like walmart in america i just cannot believe how much stuff in there but people really don't understand like in north korea countries like that even with the money in your hand if you go to stores and market there's no stuff available to buy and people who grew up in a country where they always had a supply of items as long as the money they could buy they don't understand this so north koreans even with money for the even elites right now they cannot find the basic grossery to survive so the elites were making this uh people to go to china and bringing them in their shoulders like soybean oil like the rice those things from china and when they got caught of course regime was killing the people who were working for this elites not the elites themselves and this is even though that's like what gets me more upsetting that you know the ones actually like force these smugglers to go to china and buy the goods and bring them back to the elites those ones who've been punished and not those those elites were taking advantage of this system and the people on other parts about this whole thing right now in north korea kim jong-un started this like aunties i mean socialism sentiment group something like that like it's a b-side group buying koreans like auntie you know socialism and they are the catchers literally so these catchers from pyongyang they are only targeting the people who chose anti-com communism and socialism sentiments which is smuggling or going in the market and moving around or wearing jeans or watching foreign information and those all of the things are considered to be anti-cap i mean socialism in north korea these groups have unbelievable power to punish citizens they don't need to have a trial they can just kill whoever they want they do absolute power from kim jong-un so now these groups are spreading around north korea like you know parasites all over and catching people and eliminating people's freedom even more and oppressing all them and i think you know what kim jong-un really needs to understand that like there is so much a regime can push their citizens right like so much a human can take and of course like i cannot believe how long north koreans were able to prop with this and survive through it and this is also like i keep saying humans are so adaptable and resilient that they are able to adapt and be resilient to survive for this long but at some point they're going to be some breaking point and i think that's where like kim jong is reaching right now that he is reaching this break point that people is not going to be able to tolerate this even longer because their life is on the line and who can survive in that in that country right now without anything coming from outside the country while the regime is not providing anything to the people and this is like i think uh what i think is a perfect time for the international community to raise our voice and i i don't know like you know the america is in the place right not even to think about the countries because a lot of people are so busy like thinking about their own country but it is true that like i always think the humanity the sentiment that we have towards humans it's it's so shocking to me you know like i even in the age of discovery i meet tons of people who are so passionately fighting for animals becoming a vegan and becoming you know a vegetarian and putting so much effort to looking for a substituted protein for their diet and so they don't have to kill animals and we do have spend so much energy to care about all these social causes and when the countries whenever i talk to people there are 25 millions are being in the lockdown in the entire concentration camp and what they're going through is like a modern day holocaust and people are saying give me the excuse like oh like we got so many problems in america that we are so busy to think about other people's oppression and their problems is like what literally you know of course like there's real problems i get that but the thing is the problems that americans got is not even comparable to what is like happening to north korean people you know people like i mean that's why i get so frustrated but i know that the people like you guys watching this video i know that you care and you want to see the change in north korea and i'm grateful that you are helping me to carry my message and spread spreading the message and show the true face of kim jong-un and this regime to the rest of the world so we can somehow convince our world leaders that they they they should work on this issue and because like if we don't fight for human rights as a human beings like i always wonder about this like people are like fighting for animals like like climate change gender equality like all of this right think about the world like all of us not free like all of us our freedom taken away and oppressed i know that animals not gonna fight for us i know the robot is not gonna fight for us who's left there to fight for us so by fighting for human rights it's not something we are doing the other people's favor we're kind of buying an insurance that when we are not free then we know they we have somebody left there to fight for our freedom and be our voice for us and that is why we gotta care about human rights we gotta fight for each other's freedom so thank you guys for joining me in this fight and thank you please help me to spread this video and hit that like button and so the more people aware what's happening to nursing people right now in this age of coffee so be safe and i look forward to seeing you guys all next time
