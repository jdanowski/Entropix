again sure wearing a uniform might be a again sure wearing a uniform might be a standard for many workers around the standard for many workers around the world but these soldiers are forced to world

are given thick boots to stop soldiers are given thick boots to stop them from getting frostbite but because them from getting frostbite but because Kim jong-un isn't prepared to pay for Kim jong-un isn't prepared to pay for top-quality the boots are often thin and top-quality the boots are often thin and stuffed with cotton which starts to come stuffed with cotton which starts to come undone after a few wears this means that undone after a few wears this means that the boots rub and cause injuries every the boots rub and cause injuries every single time that they're worn aside from single time that they're worn aside from starvation and being injured by their starvation and being injured by their own clothing life for female North own clothing life for female North Korean soldiers comes with its own Korean soldiers comes with its own challenges women in the state are often challenges women in the state are often faced with unwanted advances they are faced with unwanted advances they are harassed by male soldiers who just won't harassed by male soldiers who just won't leave them alone executive officers and leave them alone executive officers and commanders often go up to

the touch of their hip or neck before the touch of their hip or neck before developing into developing into something more severe sadly these women something more severe sadly these women have no one to complain to if they speak have no one to complain to if they speak up there are chances that the adoration up there are chances that the adoration will get worse leaving these women in an will get worse leaving these women in an incredibly dangerous position incredibly dangerous position there are around 180,000 women in the there are around 180,000 women in the North Korean military and many of them North Korean military and many of them lose their period due to the lose their period due to the malnutrition that they face in their malnutrition that they face in their seven years of service however they seven years of service however they often consider this a good thing because often consider this a good thing because menstruating while suffering from menstruating while suffering from starvation would make things even more starvation would make things even more difficult for them but this also makes difficult for them but this also makes it easier for commanders to cover their it easier for commanders to cover their tracks when they want to have their way tracks when they want to have their way with female soldiers one female soldier with female soldiers one female soldier who escaped revealed that there was a who escaped revealed that there was a commander who would stay in his room commander who would stay in his room after hours and calls certain women

difficult it's soldiers isn't that difficult it's only when soldiers successfully leave only when soldiers successfully leave the country which comes with its own the country which comes with its own dangerous risks that they realize just dangerous risks that they realize just how brainwashed they are even when how brainwashed they are even when soldiers find themselves seriously soldiers find themselves seriously injured they're prepared to overlook it injured they're prepared to overlook it for the good of their country injuries for the good of their country injuries are a common part of military life and are a common part of military life and each corpse has its own Hospital on the each corpse has its own Hospital on the surface it sounds like a way to help out surface it sounds like a way to help out these poor soldiers sadly there's a these poor soldiers sadly there's a catch each regiment has a facility catch each regiment has a facility called a military treatment center but called a military treatment center but there's no medicine there and if there's no medicine there and if medicine is genuinely required the medicine is genuinely required the soldiers get charged for it the medicine soldiers get charged for it the medicine that they receive is usually rubbing that they receive is usually rubbing alcohol which means that many soldiers alcohol which means that many soldiers continue to suffer despite paying money continue to suffer despite paying money to try to get themselves back to a to try to get themselves back to a healthy state but if a soldier becomes healthy state but if a soldier becomes so ill that they're forced to leave the so ill that they're forced to leave the military or if they pass away there's no military or if they pass away there's no sympathy for the family no compensation sympathy for the family no compensation is given and all that the family is given and all that the family receives as a memory of their loved one receives as a memory of their loved one is a certificate detailing how long they is a certificate detailing how long they served for but making it out alive isn't served for but making it out alive isn't necessarily the best angle to have those necessarily the best angle to have those who do not come out of military service who do not come out of military service in one piece often find that their in one piece often find that their personalities have shifted beyond repair personalities have shifted beyond repair life in the army teaches soldiers to be life in the army teaches soldiers to be tough and to ignore any feelings so that tough and to ignore any feelings so that they are often violent afterwards they are often violent afterwards there are a lot of complaints about there are a lot of complaints about soldiers from local residents and some soldiers from local residents and some people even pick up their bags and leave people even pick up their bags and leave if they see when approaching these if they see when approaching these soldiers after suffering years of abuse soldiers after suffering years of abuse in the army often come back to in the army often come back to civilization with little hope of civilization with little hope of continuing to live life like they did continuing to live life like they did before by now you might be wondering why before by now you might be wondering why these soldiers don't just leave the army these soldiers don't just leave the army to try and find a better life elsewhere to try and find a better life elsewhere some of them

Tumen River they are often met by border River they are often met by border guards who aren't afraid to take fire if guards who aren't afraid to take fire if they see a defector and if there's even they see a defector and if there's even the smallest inkling that a senior the smallest inkling that a senior leader knows of a soldier's plan to leader knows of a soldier's plan to leave the state it's likely that the leave the state it's likely that the leader will be punished too it seems leader will be punished too it seems that the threats associated to defecting that the threats associated to defecting have been enough to stop North Korean have been enough to stop North Korean soldiers from escaping as numbers have soldiers from escaping as numbers have dropped over the past years but the dropped over the past years but the numbers are still incredibly high since numbers are still incredibly high since 1953 between 100,000 and 300,000 North 1953 between 100,000 and 300,000 North
