yo so guys welcome back to another video this is another i say this is another this is this is what i said this is my second reaction to this channel this is actually a patreon video i'm doing and the video is why 200 ish americans live in north korea and this is definitely one that is kind of like it's a weird sort of idea right like you sort of think about it and you're thinking like why is it the case but i assume it's to do with maybe they're either either forced to live there but i feel like if they were forced to live there by the north korean government or whatever the us was just intervening just get them out but maybe it's just not that simple but it is something i'm sort of looking at the title and i'm just sort of thinking to myself how has this actually happened but i mean we're going to see in this video how this is the case this is quite an interesting topic then i am excited to get into it but yeah let's just get into it really why 200 edition americans live in north korea it's something i don't have a clue about but i do get a lot of suggestions for this channel and i thought why not do it for this video but yeah hopefully you guys are going to enjoy thank you all for the patreon support it's incredible and i just yeah i'm excited for this journey that we're going to go on and yeah with this content and stuff but let's get into this one let's see what this is about this video was made possible my curiosity stream when you sign up for a new subscription at curiositystream.com you'll also get access to nebula the streaming service hai is a part of get his money in north korea is a lot like north dakota they're both small they're both ice no wait wait did i hear that right north korea is a bit like north dakota okay wow i get always expecting that they both have a pension for being run by dead people and they both have some americans living there although far from enough to justify two seats in the senate if you're like me you might find it strange that despite north korea having no american embassy and technically still being at war with the us the hermit kingdom is home to a handful of resourceful scrappy independent technically sort of treasonous americans but then again you're probably not like me i run a semi-successful youtube channel about silly little facts and you probably man says semi-successful when he's nearly got two million subs bro semi-successful does not describe his channel i told man legendary right how many americans live there you ask that's a great question to which i'll give the same answer i gave when asked about how many tic tacs i could fit in my mouth at once i'm not totally sure but probably about 200. americans in north korea come in three flavors former u.s citizens who have renounced their citizenship and defected still citizen humanitarians and educators and rocky road the first group american defectors and their children is also the smallest in fact we only know for certain about two living ones these guys the dresnick brothers pictured here tying for last in the kim jong-un look-alike competition why are they there well you see in a conflict you likely learned but then forgot about in school and then learned about again and then forgot about again one of the five videos i've made on north korea back in the 1950s the us and the ussr were in something called the cool conflict and they took a look at east asia and went hey uh nice korea you've got there sure would be a shame if we uh did a war to it and so they did a war to it and split the place into north korea and gangnam style korea once the war ended which technically was never but actually was in 1953 most of the americans who had been doing the war went home but a few of them thought to themselves hey you know what i've never tried before living in the world's most brutal fascist dictatorship why not give that a go and so they do and from 1953 to the 1980s around 30 american prisoners of war and active military personnel decided not to leave or slipped across the dmz and into north korea some of them claim they did it to avoid court-martial or to avoid doing more war in vietnam but everyone knows the real reason is because they had a crush on kim jong-il just look at those dimples anyways while most defectors have died returned to the us or relocated to china an undisclosed but likely very small number of descendants remain in north korea and they don't particularly seem like they're coming back and who can blame them getting to play roles in propaganda films as evil americans and wearing uniforms that look taken from a high school production of sound of music is a level of theme that would be hard to give up i mean just look strange that's the face of a man who feels great about his life decisions the larger less permanent the happiness in his face is beyond the far less cosplay portion of north korea's american population is made up of humanitarians and university professors back in the 1990s christian groups took a break from protesting kevin smith movies and yelling at monica lewinsky and noticed that north korea was suffering from brutal food shortages and extensive flooding so they started sending people and supplies into the proudly atheist state and they haven't stopped since now this might seem like an odd arrangement considering north korea's stance on religion but christians are really good at making themselves feel at home in places they aren't initially welcome just ask the aztecs or the incas or the native americans or the spanish or the lebanese or well almost every country and ethnic group in the world actually it was a devout christian who founded the pyongyang university of science and technology which sounds like a poorly disguised front for money laundering but it's actually a private university that employs up to 70 americans a semester at the pyongyang university of scientific technology or deposed they don't call it that but i think they should western professors mostly from the states teach 500 of the nations that is crazy i'm a lead in business wait what see i always just under the illusion they were not allowed to have contact with like americans and stuff because i don't see like clips on youtube about people going to north korea but like they have to sort of be very secretive with their camera when they record certain things and if people get caught doing that they get in like serious serious trouble so i'm always i was always under the belief that they just weren't allowed to sort of talk to americans or outsiders from other countries from the western world but that is obviously not the case in a set to a certain degree which is really surprisingly spoken english while it's unclear how many americans currently work there given the us's ban on travel to the country it is still very much open and active both the humanitarians and to push professors usually spend between three and six months in north korea before heading back home to america and its many uniquely american comforts french fries english muffins belgium waffles chinese takeout etc but while they're still in the land of the uncreative haircut americans have to find things to do and their options largely depend on where they're located one common spot for americans is the rason economic zone which is the chunk of the country carved out for what industry and economic investment exists in a country whose main export is nuclear threats to north korean eyes the rason economic zone would seem to be an international hub but it's really more of an assortment of worn out russian and chinese businessmen hanging out in a chinese-funded casino for the tapus professors who are based in pyongyang the whole capital city is at their fingertips well there are interpreters and guide to watch over foreigners but it's more fun if you think of them as super loyal government mandated travel buddies what was once viewed as the world's most boring city is now home to a host of restaurants shopping centers skating rinks social clubs heck even sketchy wifi for foreigners to enjoy making pyongyang well still probably one of the most boring cities in the world if you're an american getting bored in pyongyang i've got a great idea for how you can stay entertained you see a while back i and a bunch of educationalist creators decided to make our own streaming site where we don't have to worry about demonetization or the youtube algorithm all we have to focus on is making great content it's fair enough he's got his own ad here that's pretty sick actually shout out to him wendover and obviously half is interesting making that making the money there man but this is an interesting one for sure but just it's just crazy how people optionally choose to live there in the first place it's absolutely wild to me core conflict this should be the name of coldwell satire show the author when you forget to switch accounts wait this isn't windows productions whenever ever done whenever a vid on wendover productions is private expected five minutes later one half is interesting you're going to get a copyright strike by whenever productions we're still in heaven yeah wow great video reminds me of a similar one that i saw on monday with production who watched this on oh so this was initially on whenever production's done oh wow oh good this one is a private what the hell that's kind of crazy then but interesting topics for sure and again let me know underneath this video suggestions that you have for me to do in the future when it comes to patreon reactions because that's what this patreon is i want to see any suggestions you have i'm going to start doing documentaries and stuff and all these different things in future but yeah just let me know what you want to see in the future and yeah until next time like subscribe peace
