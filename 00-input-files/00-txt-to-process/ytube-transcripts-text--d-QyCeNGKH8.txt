hello everyone this is kaiva all knowledge of the world north korea does free food distribution food is given for free the problem is that there's no rise to distribute for free there's no bread to give free of charge in 1994 north korea was going through the march of suffering at the time there was big flood in north korea as north korea made nuclear weapons the western world including the united states withdrew from north korea and they no longer held north korea and since the united states stopped giving aids china also gave no assistance to north korea 1.5 million people starved to death what kind of people do you think died the most it wasn't the poor people teachers died of hunger the most teachers only taught the students without doing any labor and they received food rations from north korean government however north korea had a bad year for rice crop the teachers couldn't do farm work nor steal foods in asia teachers are positioned as the clergy of confucianism of course north korean teachers were the propagandists of the communist party teachers all starved to death then north korea no longer had the people to brainwash and teach kim dynasty and communist party to the north korean people so north korea slowly started to collapse going to school is free of charge in north korea however there are no teachers at schools why almost all of the teachers died of hunger besides there are no learning materials medical cares are provided for nothing in north korea it's free however there's no medicine at the hospital so what's actually free at the hospital is only the diagnosis if a patient comes the doctor makes a diagnosis the patient should bring the medicine knife for medical purpose anesthetics etc housing is for free in north korea however there is no house to give north koreans for nothing north korea's employment rate is 100 anyone having trouble getting a job got to go to north korea then how much do you think the working people receive in north korea this is a fact check they receive about five dollars in other words it is no exaggeration to say that the public officials of north korea receive almost no paycheck why why why because everything is for free this is the reason why black markets are developed in north korea what north korean government provides is absolutely insufficient people purchase things at the black market by paying with chinese money and u.s dollars etc in the world north korea is the country with the most advanced black market and at present north korea's black market is the tool that leads north korean economy animals are bred by feed and human beings are raised by distribution north korea is a society of distribution system if you are not loyal to north korean regime you will immediately be excluded from distribution north korea's privileged people do not do farmworks so if they are not loyal to kim dynasty they will not get the distribution then they will right away die from hunger this is the reason why they have nothing to do but be loyal to the communist party this is kaiva and see in the next video god bless
