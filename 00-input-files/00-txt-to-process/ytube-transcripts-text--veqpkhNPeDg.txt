good evening and welcome to 60 minutes if you thought the insults hurled between north korea and the united states couldn't get any more ridiculous then this week set a new standard in fars the rogue nation sentenced president donald trump to death because he apparently called their leader kim jong-un short and fat ordinarily this kind of behavior would be dismissed with a chuckle but 2017 has seen tensions on the korean peninsula rise to the most dangerous level ever the threat of nuclear war is real and australia is in the sights of the north's missiles after months of negotiations nine news correspondent tom steinfert was given rare permission to travel to north korea there he discovered a country whose people are not only ready for conflict but fully aware it could mean the end of the world [Music] [Applause] this is north korea as it projects itself to the world a nation marching in unison ready to defend its leader at all costs do you think a third world war is a possibility here who knows our country is nuclear armed and donald trump is going to attack us but tonight we show you a north korea you've never seen [Music] as we head inside the world's most secretive state at a time of unprecedented tension who is the enemy american american yankees wow in the midst of a nuclear showdown that has implications for us all rocket man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime with unpredictable leaders and an escalating war of words we will have no choice but to totally destroy north korea it is the most serious threat to world peace in decades in the moment that you launched 10 missiles that are equivalent to 1 000 bombs of hiroshima and nagasaki who will survive in this world not australian nobody in the united states the world will end as we know it it's rare for foreign journalists to get access to north korea at the best of times let alone right now be careful with your cameras i will tell you where you can take photos or not okay an ever-present team of minders carefully monitors our every move on a highly orchestrated tour led by government official ju jong-hyok the problem is that most of the western people have no idea what is going down here they don't know the reality of our country what is the reality our duty is that we are enjoying a normal comfortable happy life here and we have our own way so i think that with single mind we can pave the way to our final victory under the wise leadership of our respected supreme leader kim jong-un i was last in pyongyang two and a half years ago and the changes are striking from new streets to grandiose buildings like the scitec complex which celebrates the regime's technical achievements full of the students who are going to read the books at a tart is a replica of a uni rocket a forerunner to the intercontinental ballistic missiles which can now reach the american mainland of course we are very proud of the results of the space rocket and also the other successes in science and fields because it means we are developing and we are now becoming a space power and that kind of your economic power we are ready pyongyang is the showpiece capital of one of the poorest countries on earth home to the nation's privileged elite but make your way out of the city and a very different north korea is visible one seldom seen by foreign eyes we're on our way 200 kilometers east to the city of won sun a bumpy five-hour journey through dirt pool farmland and dark tunnels [Music] we stopped briefly at a coffee shop where the walls are plastered with pictures of north korean missile launchers so are you excited when you see that they've tested a nuclear weapon that's it it's excitement i am that's beyond my greatest excitement because we were weak but now we are strong single-hearted unity great leadership and we have the icbms so i usually say to donald trump come come come to me i will choke you with my h-bones wow in one sun we find fishermen jostling for space to catch dinner at random we speak to kim yong-chol who's lived here for 15 years donald trump is just like a dog barking at the moon immediately he casts the conversation to politics as you've seen on the tv reports trump is saying crap like he's going to kill us all but we have our supreme leader so even if trump brings all his forces even if the sky falls we are not afraid with its beaches and relaxed vibe kim jong-un has earmarked one sun as north korea's future holiday hot spot but overseas visitors are few and far between on the headland out there the regime has built this huge brand new international airport because they're actually hoping to set up a billion dollar tourism industry in this country but given the current climate it's no surprise that not a single passenger plane has touched down there yet the site's not going to waste though because while no planes have been taking off from there plenty of missiles have been wan sun is one of the regime's key missile test sites almost 40 have been fired from this area as north korea or the dprk develops its capability to strike targets around the world is there anything that the world should fear from the dprk because from my perspective the thing that scares a lot of people is the fact that you are now armed with nuclear weapons i think that none at all no threat at all but there is one threat uh it is one street in the world it is from not deeper korea but from donald trump so i think that we must get rid of this threat we must get rid of donald trump i think how then do you feel when you hear donald trump say that he wants to destroy your nation donald trump is going to turn our skyscrapers into ashes total destruction of korea every citizen every member of the korean nation is got ang has got angry oh vol maniac donald trump so if donald trump did decide to attack your country what would happen i think that the next step will be the destruction of united states no matter how old or young everyone here marches to the beat of the regime [Music] north korea's brightest students are rewarded with a stay at the songdewan children's camp there's plenty of fun on offer from football hello to robots they don't seem very sure of the australian guy but like kids everywhere they can't get enough of video games what are you teaching these boys do you teach them the technique i teach gorilla warfare the tactics kimi song used to vanquish the japanese army what's striking is that the children also see these games as practice for war what do you like about this game i'm so happy to kill americans so you dream this is an american that you're shooting americans and japanese and south koreans they are the enemy of the korean people [Music] time and again we are shown the carefully staged performances of pyongyang's most talented students there's a rigid discipline to growing up here that's hard to understand as an at outsider foreign studies university students learn english from tapes with a distinctly american accent was to investigate some unconventional styles of housing and report on one we're allowed to speak to classmates ichion rim and lee so shion although our minders insist we avoid anything political what changes have you seen in pyongyang over the last couple of years under the wise leadership of the respective supreme leader kim jong-un our country has changed into a very luxury and modern country and yeah in the last couple of years there are many miracles changing our country into purpose proposed country and our people enjoying benefits of socialism but one seemingly simple question is much harder to answer for you learning here you come to the foreign studies what is it about the rest of the world that interests you so much restorable uh all the other countries you know foreign countries what what what are you interested in from foreign countries that's not that simple um i don't quite get to get your for foreign studies you you study foreign foreign languages foreign languages what is it about other languages other countries that you find interesting should i say so no special comments okay if they say what they want they will be in trouble they will be kicked out of pyongyang if they say oh i don't like my leader and then oh north korea is bad country then no it's going to be huge trouble for them julie knows all too well the expectations of the regime now living in seoul he escaped from north korea at the age of 16. what would happen to you if you went back to pyongyang tomorrow what would the government do public execution seriously because i mean i'm i'm talking about north korea at now right with you this will be on tv so this interview will be shown in north korea and they'll say this man's a description exactly exactly i mean if i go back to north korea first of all norton government maybe torture me and then they forced me to announce a certain kind of a script written by the government you don't seem scared by this well actually somebody has to tell this i mean the truth i mean the north korean government tried to hide up truth they try to hide the sky with their palms but they cannot hide everything coming up the world will end as we know it but isn't that madness what is the north's master plan just over the border from here north korea has more than 10 000 rocket launchers ready and named the us military on high alert if war broke out tomorrow are you guys ready to go i believe we are and the south living under constant threat you must dread the day that you might have to actually put one of these on that's next on 60 minutes when i got to south korea i was so confused that people are so nice really yeah so nice and so i mean it was kind of one of culture shock that i had these days sungju li enjoys a freedom he never knew existed in his former life in north korea since he fled the country in 2002 he's worked tirelessly to expose the hypocrisy of the regime north korea is a country for just 10 of total population i can say 90 are slaves north korea is a country but i can say north korea is prison the regime's brutality is notorious and not just how it crushes any sign of descent from within in february the world was stunned by the brazen assassination in malaysia of kim jong-un's exiled half-brother kim jong-nam with vx nerve gas for many it showed just how erratic and ruthless the north korean dictator really is what do you think of kim jong-un well international community keeps saying that kim jong-un is very unpredictable he is very irrational but my perspective kim jong-un is very predictable he's very rational is he smart yes in terms of protecting its own regime that's why he's he's developing nuclear weapon do you think he wants war he will not attack united states first he will not attack south korea first but if south korea and united states kind of try to use a military option then they will attack with tensions rising the u.s military has been stepping up its preparations for war just this week there was a massive show of force by three aircraft carrier strike groups off the korean peninsula drawing the ayah of pyongyang two kilometers from the north korean border we joined u.s marines as they honed their shooting skills and went through drills for the possibility of chemical warfare well we hear so much about the prospect of a nuclear attack it's actually conventional warfare that's much more likely at first just over the border from here north korea has more than 10 000 rocket launchers ready and aimed at the south and within the first few days of war here more than a million lives could be lost if war broke out tomorrow are you guys ready to go i believe we are regardless of the environment these marines need to be prepared for everything colonel maura hennigan is the combat logistic regiment's commanding officer the marines that are here today are working actually at their basic infantry skills every marine is a rifleman so they have the opportunity to come out and they they shoot in in multiple environments there's a certain irony to this because they'd hear these gunshots in north korea yep they sure would and and we actually get to listen every night to whether it's the radios that are going off or just everything that's happening right across the line so yeah it's not lost on anyone with tensions on a hair trigger there are fears the region could be tipped into an accidental war we've come to south korea's yonpyong island just 10 kilometers from the north korean mainland 2 000 people call it home with 2 000 marines stationed here to protect them seven years ago the island came under a hail of fire from north korean artillery killing four people and injuring twenty it followed a military exercise in the south the pyongyang viewed as aggression so how long have you been living on the island here for yeah for about 30 years for local guest house owner song yong ok it was the most terrifying day of her life the whole town was just covered in black smoke and it was a sea of fire it was catastrophic it sounds like it really had an effect on you yeah yes it did not just me but all the townspeople south korea has nearly 20 000 bomb shelters dotted across the country seriously heavy door it's not until you head inside that you appreciate how frightening it would be to have to use one oh wow it's huge this shelter is equipped to hold 530 villages a quarter of the island's population for three days it's sealed against conventional chemical and biological attack we as well prepared as we can be because we have gone through this before you must dread the day that you might have to actually put one of these on i hope that never happens we've heard so many threats from kim jong-un and donald trump does that make you worry sometimes about your safety here i don't feel completely safe kim jong-un and donald trump i'm afraid to say it like this but they are both a big psycho neither of them seem like normal people to me kim jong-un our leader is just doing the only thing that a small country a tiny country with 25 million people can do to secure its survival its only life insurance is nuclear deterrence hello alejandro de banos is north korea's unofficial spokesman outside of the hermit kingdom he was my guide last time i visited north korea this time i have to catch up with him in barcelona after the spanish government slapped him with a travel ban we declare there will be no world without korea if dprk if north korea is attacked nuclearly by the united states the answer will be nuclear as well so you'll just destroy the world is the united states the one that will destroy by launching a nuclear attack on north korea we just answer in the moment that you launch 10 missiles that are equivalent to 1 000 bombs of hiroshima and nagasaki who will survive in this world not australian not spaniards nobody in the united states the world will end as we know it but isn't that madness the madness is the united states to try to conquer the world and try to destroy other societies the madness is to act as an emperor and the other countries serving that emperor and contributing troops and money for the end of the world that's the madness coming up this is effectively where the battle line is drawn a warning to australia they will not be able to avoid the disaster and uncovering the real north korea behind all the politics you i've got to know the people and and they are a fantastic people high five yeah literally the only time on this trip where i don't have a minder sitting on my shoulder yeah i wish it would calm down and it's bloody frightening that's next on 60 minutes in north korea you can take photos yeah we visit the demilitarized zone that separated this divided peninsula for more than 60 years yeah the flags of the countries which attended criminal under the name of u.n following us here rival soldiers eyeball one another at what's regarded as the most dangerous border in the world this is effectively where the battle line is drawn just about the most tense place on earth right now at the moment the mood here it's deadly serious australia stands with the republic of korea in solidarity against the provocative and illegal behaviour of north korea just a few weeks before our visit the australian foreign and defense ministers stood at the southern side in a move that infuriated pyongyang i want to repeat some of the articles which was by the spokesman of the ministry of foreign affairs of our country should australia continue to follow the u.s in imposing military economic and diplomatic pressure upon the dpr career despite our repeated warnings they will not be able to avoid the disaster australia will not be able to avoid disaster yeah disaster so you think that if australia gets involved in any action against the dprk it will be also harmful to australian people i think our approach seems to have made us a target i don't accept that i don't believe australia is a primary target foreign minister julie bishop believes north korea is using its nuclear arsenal to hold the world to ransom north korea has used coercive blackmail as a negotiating tactic in the past and it is ramping up its ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs in order to put itself in the best negotiating position the official government line there is that australia is heading for disaster surely that worries you well i didn't say it didn't worry me doesn't it's an issue that we are dealing with i just want to read you a couple of quotes from donald trump he's threatened to unleash fire and fury like the world has never seen he says he's going to totally destroy north korea he's called kim jong-un little rocket man and also referred to him as being short and fat is that really the kind of diplomacy you want to hitch your wagon to it certainly has a reaction in north korea and the trading of insults is not a good reaction no it doesn't help the cause what president trump's intervention has done is brought china into the discussion in a very direct way and i believe that that will be part of the most successful of strategy we've seen today so you think that language is actually beneficial i said that i'll use my words the language has made beijing recalculate its strategy its risk and now china is deeply involved and i believe that is beneficial [Music] there are some lighter moments on our trip to north korea another side of life here that the regime is keen to promote do you think i can win yeah of course i've been in the piano [Music] today i've been invited to take part in the pyongyang marathon surely one of the world's most obscure running events what do you make of the turnout here this one's very small the big marathons in april that had over a thousand one hundred western runners this is i think twenty nick bonner has run a tourism business here for more than two decades how much of that do you think is people that are just a bit worried about the situation here i think it's yeah partly that it's also that the americans can no longer visit so that's 20 down um yeah and it's the current situation it's it's definitely hit tourism and behind all the politics you i've got to know the people and and they are a fantastic people politics apart uh yeah i wish it would calm down and it's bloody frightening after a north korean misfire we pound the pavements of pyongyang [Music] it really is nice just to be out literally the only time on this trip where i don't have a mind sitting on my shoulder the whole time watching every move i'm free out here for once hello high five you can't help but feel an event like this is very much a charm offensive from a regime that's constantly paranoid about how it is perceived beating its chest to the outside world and subjecting its people to a never-ending barrage of propaganda well we got some of it here oh my they still produce this kind of rubbish it was everywhere oh my god it's oh do you mind having it like crazy translating sometimes for us north korean defector lee grew up seeing this kind of material every day we killed usa and our target is usa and this end of our enemy but this is just part of their everyday life isn't it growing up with this imagery of the us getting slaughtered yeah exactly i mean this is not just postcards in kind of in the in the textbook their textbook in every shop window yeah of course i mean that's that's north korea that's kind of that's kind of the the way i mean the way to to brainwash people before we go soon lee has something to show me his two dogs peaceful and unification symbols of hope that one day the two careers will be reunited song julie believes if change is to come it must be from within if international community attack north korea the people will stick together around its leader and then they will fight until the last person exists military intervention intervention cannot be solution but my solution is to send information give them power give them information and then make them choose their future so don't bombard north korea with missiles bombard them with information and knowledge yes i mean knowledge has power it's stronger than weapon [Music] if there's one thing you'd like us to take back to australia about your country what would it be i hope that tv channel line from australia let all the people in australia feel that deeper koreans are really peace loving and friendly people the nuclear deterrence of our country is not to attack other countries including australia our nuclear deterrence is to protect ourselves from the nuclear threats from u.s yeah so usually i say to my foreign friends that it takes a thief to catch a scene [Music] good evening and welcome to 60 minutes if you thought the insults hurled between north korea and the united states couldn't get any more

infuriated pyongyang i want to repeat some of the articles which was by the spokesman of the ministry of foreign affairs of our country should australia continue to follow the u.s in imposing military economic and diplomatic pressure upon the dpr career despite our repeated warnings they will not be able to avoid the disaster australia will not be able to avoid disaster no disaster so you think that if australia gets involved in any action against the dprk it will be also harmful to australian people i think our approach seems to have made us a target i don't accept that i don't believe australia is a primary target foreign minister julie bishop believes north korea is using its nuclear arsenal to hold the world to ransom north korea has used coercive blackmail as a negotiating tactic in the past and it is ramping up its ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs in order to put itself in the best negotiating position the official government line there is that australia is heading for disaster surely that worries you well i didn't say it didn't worry me it doesn't it's an issue that we are dealing with i just want to read you a couple of quotes from donald trump he's threatened to unleash fire and fury like the world has never seen he says he's going to totally destroy north korea he's called kim jong-un little rocket man and also referred to him as being short and fat is that really the kind of diplomacy you want to hit your wagon to it certainly has a reaction in north korea and the trading of insults is not a good reaction now it doesn't help the cause what president trump's intervention has done is brought china into the discussion in a very direct way and i believe that that will be part of the most successful of strategy we've seen today so you think that language is actually beneficial i said that i'll use my words the language has made beijing recalculate its strategy its risk and now china is deeply involved and i believe that is beneficial [Music] there are some lighter moments on our trip to north korea another side of life here that the regime is keen to promote do you think i can win yeah of course [Music] today i've been invited to take part in the pyongyang marathon surely one of the world's most obscure running events what do you make of the turnout here this one's very small the big marathons in april that had over a thousand one hundred western runners this is i think twenty nick bonner has run a tourism business here for more than two decades how much of that do you think is people that are just a bit worried about the situation here i think it's yeah partly that it's also that the americans can no longer visit so that's 20 down um yeah and it's the current situation it's it's definitely hit tourism and behind all the politics you i've got to know the people and and they are a fantastic people politics apart uh yeah i wish it would calm down and it's bloody frightening after a north korean misfire [Music] we pound the pavements of pyongyang [Music] it really is nice just to be out literally the only time on this trip where i don't have a mind sitting on my shoulder the whole time watching every move i'm free out here for once hello high five you can't help but feel an event like this is very much a charm offensive from a regime that's constantly paranoid about how it is perceived beating its chest to the outside world and subjecting its people to a never-ending barrage of propaganda well we got some of it here oh my they still produce this kind of rubbish it was everywhere oh my god it's oh do you mind having like crazy translating some of this for us north korean defector lee grew up seeing this kind of material every day we killed um usa and our target is usa and this end of our enemy but this is just part of their everyday life isn't it growing up with this imagery of the us getting slaughtered yeah exactly i mean this is not just postcards in kind of in the in the textbook their textbook in every shop window yeah of course i mean that's that's north korea that's kind of that's kind of the the way i mean the way to to brainwash people before we go soon julie has something to show me his two dogs peaceful and unification symbols of hope that one day the two careers will be reunited believes if change is to come it must be from within if international community attack north korea the people will stick together around its leader and then they will fight until the last person exists military intervention intervention cannot be solution but my solution is to send information give them power give them information and then make them choose their future so don't bombard north korea with missiles bombard them with information and knowledge yes i mean knowledge has power it's stronger than weapons if there's one thing you'd like us to take back to australia about your country what would it be i hope that tv channel line from australia let all the people in australia feel that koreans are really peace loving and friendly people the nuclear deterrence of our country is not to attack other countries including australia our nuclear deterrence is to protect ourselves from the nuclear threats from u.s yeah so usually i say to my foreign friends that it takes a sieve to catch a seed good evening and welcome to 60 minutes if you thought the insults hurled between north korea and the united states couldn't get any more ridiculous then this week set a new standard in fars the rogue nation sentenced president donald trump to death because he apparently called their leader kim jong-un short and fat ordinarily this kind of behaviour would be dismissed with a chuckle but 2017 has seen tensions on the korean peninsula rise to the most dangerous level ever the threat of nuclear war is real and australia is in the sights of the north's missiles after months of negotiations nine news correspondent tom steinfert was given rare permission to travel to north korea there he discovered a country whose people are not only ready for conflict but fully aware it could mean the end of the world [Music] [Applause] this is north korea as it projects itself to the world a nation marching in unison ready to defend its leader at all costs do you think a third world war is a possibility here who knows our country is nuclear armed and donald trump is going to attack us but tonight we show you a north korea you've never seen [Music] as we head inside the world's most secretive state at a time of unprecedented tension who is the enemy american american yankees wow in the midst of a nuclear showdown that has implications for us all rocket man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime with unpredictable leaders and an escalating war of words we will have no choice but to totally destroy north korea it is the most serious threat to world peace in decades in the moment that you launched 10 missiles that are equivalent to 1 000 bombs of hiroshima and nagasaki who will survive in this world not australian nobody in the united states the world will end as we know it it's rare for foreign journalists to get access to north korea at the best of times let alone right now be careful with your cameras i will tell you where you can take photos or not okay an ever-present team of minders carefully monitors our every move on a highly orchestrated tour led by government official ju jong hyok the problem is that most of the western people have no idea what is going down here they don't know the reality of our country what is the reality our unity is that we are enjoying a normal comfortable happy life here and we have our own way so i think that with single mind we can pave the way to our final victory under the wise leadership of our respected supreme leader kim jong-un i was last in pyongyang two and a half years ago and the changes are striking from new streets to grandiose buildings like the scitec complex which celebrates the regime's technical achievements full of the students who are going to read the books at a tart is a replica of a uni rocket a forerunner to the intercontinental ballistic missiles which can now reach the american mainland of course we are very proud of the results of the space rocket and also the the other successes in science and fields because it means we are developing and we are now becoming a space power and that kind of your economic power we are ready pyongyang is the showpiece capital of one of the poorest countries on earth home to the nation's privileged elite but make your way out of the city and a very different north korea is visible one seldom seen by foreign eyes we're on our way 200 kilometers east to the city of won sun a bumpy five-hour journey through dirt pool farmland and dark tunnels [Music] we stopped briefly at a coffee shop where the walls are plastered with pictures of north korean missile launchers so are you excited when you see that they have tested a nuclear weapon that's it it's excitement oh yeah that's beyond my greatest excitement because we were weak but now we are strong single-hearted unity great leadership and we have the icbms so i i usually say to donald trump come come come to me i will choke you with my h-bones wow in one sun we find fishermen jostling for space to catch dinner at random we speak to kim yong-chol who's lived here for 15 years donald trump is just like a dog barking at the moon immediately he casts the conversation to politics as you've seen on the tv reports trump is saying crap like he's going to kill us all but we have our supreme leader so even if trump brings all his forces even if the sky falls we are not afraid with its beaches and relaxed vibe kim jong-un has earmarked one sun as north korea's future holiday hot spot but overseas visitors are few and far between on the headland out there the regime has built this huge brand new international airport because they're actually hoping to set up a billion dollar tourism industry in this country but given the current climate it's no surprise that not a single passenger plane has touched down there yet the site's not going to waste though because while no planes have been taking off from there plenty of missiles have been wan sun is one of the regime's key missile test sites almost 40 have been fired from this area as north korea or the dprk develops its capability to strike targets around the world is there anything that the world should fear from the dprk because from my perspective the thing that scares a lot of people is the fact that you are now armed with nuclear weapons i think that none at all no threat at all but there is one threat uh it is one street in the world it is from not deeper korea but from donald trump so i think that we must get rid of this threat we must get rid of donald trump i think how then do you feel when you hear donald trump say that he wants to destroy your nation donald trump is going to turn our skyscrapers into ashes total destruction of korea every citizen every member of the korean nation is got ang has got angry all romania donald trump so if donald trump did decide to attack your country what would happen i think that the next step will be the destruction of united states no matter how old or young everyone here marches to the beat of the regime [Music] north korea's brightest students are rewarded with a stay at the songdewan children's camp there's plenty of fun on offer from football hello to robots they don't seem very sure of the australian guy but like kids everywhere they can't get enough of video games what are you teaching these boys do you teach them the technique i teach guerilla warfare the tactics kimi-sung used to vanquish the japanese army what's striking is that the children also see these games as practice for war what do you like about this game i'm so happy to kill americans so you dream this is an american that you're shooting americans and japanese and south koreans they are the enemy of the korean people [Music] time and again we are shown the carefully staged performances of pyongyang's most talented students there's a rigid discipline to growing up here that's hard to understand as an afternoon outsider at pyongyang's foreign studies university students learn english from tapes with a distinctly american accent our class project was to investigate some unconventional styles of housing and report on one we're allowed to speak to classmates ichion rim and lee sohion although our minders insist we avoid anything political what changes have you seen in pyongyang over the last couple of years under the wise leadership of the respective supreme leader kim jong-un our country has changed into a very luxury and modern country and yeah in the last couple of years there are many miracles changing our country into purpose proposed country and our people enjoying benefits of socialism but one seemingly simple question is much harder to answer for you learning here you come to the foreign studies what is it about the rest of the world that interests you so much restore all the other countries you know foreign countries what what what are you interested in from foreign countries that's not that simple um i don't quite get to get your okay for foreign studies you you study foreign foreign languages foreign languages what is it about other languages other countries that you find interesting should i say so no special comments okay if they say what they want they will be in trouble they will be kicked out of pyongyang if they say oh i don't like my leader and then north korea is bad country then no it's going to be huge trouble for them knows all too well the expectations of the regime now living in seoul he escaped from north korea at the age of 16. what would happen to you if you went back to pyongyang tomorrow what would the government do public execution seriously because i mean i'm i'm talking about north korea at now right with you this will be on tv so this interview will be shown in north korea and i'll say this man to describe exactly exactly i mean if i go back to north korea first of all norton government maybe torture me and then they forced me to announce a certain kind of a script written by the government you don't seem scared by this well actually somebody has to tell this i mean the truth i mean the north korean government tried to hide up truth they try to hide the sky with their palms but they cannot hide everything coming up the world will end as we know it but isn't that madness what is the north's master plan just over the border from here north korea has more than 10 000 rocket launchers ready and named the us military on high alert if war broke out tomorrow are you guys ready to go i believe we are and the south living under constant threat you must dread the day that you might have to actually put one of these on that's next on 60 minutes when i got to south korea i was so confused that people are so nice really yeah so nice and so i mean it was kind of one of culture shock that i had these days sungju lee enjoys a freedom he never knew existed in his former life in north korea since he fled the country in 2002 he's worked tirelessly to expose the hypocrisy of the regime north korea is a country for just 10 of total population i can say 90 are slaves north korea is a country but i can say north korea is prison the regime's brutality is notorious and not just how it crushes any sign of descent from within in february the world was stunned by the brazen assassination in malaysia of kim jong-un's exiled half-brother kim jong-nam with vx nerve gas [Music] for many it showed just how erratic and ruthless the north korean dictator really is what do you think of kim jong-un well international community keeps saying that kim jong-un is very unpredictable he is very irrational but my perspective kim jong-un is very predictable he's very rational is he smart yes in terms of protecting its own regime that's why he's he's developing nuclear weapon do you think he wants war he will not attack united states first he will not attack south korea first but if south korea and united states kind of try to use military option then they will attack with tensions rising the u.s military has been stepping up its preparations for war just this week there was a massive show of force by three aircraft carrier strike groups off the korean peninsula drawing the ayah of pyongyang two kilometres from the north korean border we joined u.s marines as they honed their shooting skills and went through drills for the possibility of chemical warfare well we hear so much about the prospect of a nuclear attack it's actually conventional warfare that's much more likely at first just over the border from here north korea has more than 10 000 rocket launchers ready and aimed at the south and within the first few days of war here more than a million lives could be lost if war broke out tomorrow are you guys ready to go i believe we are regardless of the environment uh these marines need to be prepared for everything colonel maura hennigan is the combat logistic regiment's commanding officer the marines that are here today are working actually at their basic infantry skills every marine is a rifleman so they have the opportunity to come out and they they shoot in in multiple environments there's a certain irony to this because they'd hear these gunshots in north korea yep they sure would and and we actually get to listen every night to whether it's the radios that are going off or just everything that's happening right across the line so yeah it's not lost on anyone with tensions on a hair trigger there are fears the region could be tipped into an accidental war we've come to south korea's yeonpyong island just 10 kilometers from the north korean mainland two thousand people call it home with two thousand marines stationed here to protect them seven years ago the island came under a hail of fire from north korean artillery killing four people and injuring twenty it followed a military exercise in the south that pyongyang viewed as aggression so how long have you been living on the island here for yeah for about 30 years for local guest house owner song yong ok it was the most terrifying day of her life the whole town was just covered in black smoke and it was a sea of fire it was catastrophic it sounds like it really had an effect on you yes it did not just me but all the townspeople south korea has nearly 20 000 bomb shelters dotted across the country a seriously heavy door it's not until you head inside that you appreciate how frightening it would be to have to use one oh wow it's huge this shelter is equipped to hold 530 villages a quarter of the island's population for three days it's sealed against conventional chemical and biological attacks as well prepared as we can be because we have gone through this before you must dread the day that you might have to actually put one of these on i hope that never happens we've heard so many threats from kim jong-un and donald trump does that make you worry sometimes about your safety here i don't feel completely safe kim jong-un and donald trump i'm afraid to say it like this but they are both a big psycho neither of them seem like normal people to me kim jong-un our leader is just doing the only thing that a small country a tiny country with 25 million people can do to secure its survival its only life insurance is nuclear deterrence hello alejandro de banos is north korea's unofficial spokesman outside of the hermit kingdom he was my guide last time i visited north korea this time i have to catch up with him in barcelona after the spanish government slapped him with a travel ban we declare there will be no world without korea if dprk if north korea is attacked nuclearly by the united states the answer will be nuclear as well so you'll just destroy the world is the united states the one that will destroy it by launching a nuclear attack on north korea we just answer in the moment that you launch 10 missiles that are equivalent to 1 000 bombs of hiroshima and nagasaki who will survive in this world not australian not spaniards nobody in the united states the world will end as we know it but isn't that madness the madness is the united states to try to conquer the world and try to destroy other societies the madness is to act as an emperor and the other countries serving that emperor and contributing troops and money for the end of the world that's the madness coming up this is effectively where the battle line is drawn a warning to australia they will not be able to avoid the disaster and uncovering the real north korea behind all politics you i've got to know the people and and they are a fantastic people high five yeah literally the only time on this trip where i don't have a mind sitting on my shoulder yeah i wish it would calm down and it's bloody frightening that's next on 60 minutes in north korea you can take photos yeah we visit the demilitarized zone that separated this divided peninsula for more than 60 years they are the flags of the countries which attended creamer under the name of u.n following us here rival soldiers eyeball one another at what's regarded as the most dangerous border in the world this is effectively where the battle line is drawn just about the most tense place on earth right now at the moment the mood here it's deadly serious australia stands with the republic of korea in solidarity against the provocative and illegal behaviour of north korea just a few weeks
