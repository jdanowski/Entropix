what's up guys so honor which was huawei's sub brand well honor separated from huawei due to the ban issues and after separation though honor now can use google services in its smartphones and now honor is all set to launch its first smartphone series after being sold by huawei in november 2020 and that series called the honor 50. anyway if you want to get video like this sub to this channel will be amazing now let's get start the video [Music] so this smartphone is the exact same copy of the upcoming huawei p50 series which is surprising and great for us at the same time because we get to see the huawei p50 like look a lot earlier so here is the official look of the huawei p50 and here is the honor 50 it's having four cameras in two big circles and what is presumably the primary camera takes up the entire upper circle while three smaller sensors and a flash can be seen located on the circle below also the design is very much similar to the upcoming huawei p50 series phones just the main difference here is the location of the main sensor because the main camera sensor of the huawei p50 series is located on the upper side and other three camera sensors are located in circle below furthermore there are different color options in this phone which further suggests that the huawei p50 might get similar color options as the honor 50 because i was saying despite being separate from huawei this design similarity between the leading smartphone series of two big brands suggests that the honor 50 may have been in development and design and planning phase much before honor separated and become an independent company so there cannot be any other explanations though since honors sale included all of its assets including our nd arms supply chain and a workforce of more than 7 000 employees so due to no longer being associated with huawei the us government's restrictions do not apply to honor smartphones and this smartphone is finally coming with google services but the huawei p50 will not have them instead it will have a brand new operating system called harmony os which is great anyway the honor 50 will also come with 100 watt super charging technology and i'm sure that this amazing feature will also come with the huawei p50 but this is not officially confirmed also you know that huawei unveiled the second major version of harmony operating system 2.0 and several new devices that have it pre-installed and now the number of products that upgraded to the new os has apparently already crossed 10 million in just a week with the release of harmony os moreover the chinese tech giant also announced a number of smartphone models and other products that would receive this update also according to a qq report news had initially surfaced that the company managed to bring in over 10 million devices to the new operating system by some netizens but now internal staff members of huawei have apparently made the news official and confirmed this report as of right now it is estimated that there are about 200 million smartphones from the brand in circulation all across the globe most of these models would be eligible for the upgrade to the newly launched harmony os so we can expect this number to rise even further as more models become eligible for the new update by the way earlier this week the media group announced that it is closely working together with huawei to integrate the latter harmony os and its products the group also stated that it has already launched 12 products that are equipped with harmony os across seven different categories notably the news arrives just days after an executive of the chinese home appliance maker announced that most of its smart products will feature the smartphone brand proprietary operating system also the former had even announced that it would be cooperating with huawei for its harmony os back in 2020. just recently media had even launched the world first smart refrigerator that supports the harmony os so the company added that its products launching with the new os will also enable it to offer its customers more value and better services as well furthermore the harmony os platform was built with multi-device support and cross-platform integration as well this means that its ecosystem is designed to work in a smart home where multiple iot products are connected to one another and can be controlled by the user remotely through a smartphone or a smart hub the company has already launched various products with harmony os with new releases including the likes of dehumidifiers refrigerators and more so this number is likely to rise further with new launches in the near future anyway what do you guys think about it let me know your thoughts on that in the

right hanif me time actually enhances the quality of the video call to 1080p high definition while at the same time optimizing it to have ultra low lag all without using up a lot of internet data like other video call apps now isn't that amazing exactly joe another awesome feature that i love about the vision s is called the me time call transfer which can be used to switch a video call from your

huawei vision s it even made me look better on camera so i'm happy jojo ah that's only because of the camera yeah all right we'll talk about the connection aspect of the vision s but there's still the entertainment and intelligence to come that's right joe there's loads more to talk about coming up after the break and i am sure all of you are dying to know how much the huawei vision s costs right

comfortable for us both the huawei vision s and the me time are not only useful for the working class but also to anyone who needs to stay connected with others using video so moving on from the camera let's now talk about the entertainment aspect of the huawei vision s screens shall we after all the huawei vision s is beyond the tv honey why don't you tell us more about this high tech screen okay no problem okay i'm sure a lot of you are asking how's the display quality light is good or does it sometimes have blurred images usually what spoils our mood when watching movies is the display quality right yellow but the huawei vision s series smart screen is totally different it's got a brilliant 4k uhd screen with 120hz high refresh rate which is better than the refresh rate of a typical tv in the market which is only 60 hertz oh tell us how so i am doing the answering right now huh well the huawei vision s uses 4k 120hz screens which is generally limited to high-end products to provide users with premium image quality with 60hz screens as seen on typical tvs it's actually quite normal for blurry motion to occur i mean you can see from this comparison video with 60 hertz there's obvious trailing but with 120 hertz it's super smooth at all times all right be it sports or action movies 120 hertz has always better smoother high speed motion pictures than 60 hertz your viewing experience is definitely enhanced with a 4way vision s amazing adding to that this smart screen also comes with huawei's own hong ku image engine which allows for smart motion estimation and motion composition right that's right smart motion estimation and motion composition also known as smart memc is a frame insertion technology that can be used to insert an additional three or four frames between the original adjacent frames so instead of a low frame rate you now get 120 frames per second which reduces the motion trailing that you usually get with 60 hertz screens basically picture quality that is beautiful and smooth like my skin oh you just had to didn't you but i agree you're right whatever you watch on the huawei vision screen confirm will enjoy more because of the display quality when i have the vision s i confirm would aja all my friends to come over and watch football yes yes and racing at home instead of going to the mama yep i agree and the smart screen actually displays colors using the dci p3 92 white color gamut specs that's pro great accuracy you know that this enables the colors that you see on screen to appear bright beautiful and very realistic for example it can give you more color accuracy by correctly displaying the light green or dark green tones depending on the distance of the subject yeah and it's also got advanced dynamic contrast and super resolution turbo meaning if somebody is watching a video that doesn't have a good original color or picture quality the screen can actually help make both look better wow here check out this comparison video that shows videos with and without these technology but what about those who like the cinema vibe you know watching movies in the dark while munching on caramel popcorn they shouldn't worry too with the 65 inch super big screen it can definitely feel like you're watching your favorite movie at the cinema that's right also if you are concerned about the vision of your child who loves to watch cartoon all day long take comfort in knowing that the huawei vision s comes with tuv greenland certified eye care yes it can relieve eye strain by using flicker free technology to effectively eliminate screen flickers it also has low blue light technology to protect your eyes from the harmful blue light spectrum so you can just watch for long periods without worry another reason why this smart screen makes life so much better quite tuned right the huawei vision s it's really beyond achieving 65 inch 4k display and 120 hertz refresh rate smart memc realistic bright color display what can this smart screen not doula right but we're not done with the entertainment features of this smart screen just yet the audio is also another important feature of the entertainment experience you get with the huawei vision s yes audio is very very important and the huawei vision s audio really powered it's got not two not three but four 10 watt speakers long story short you guys know when to go and buy additional sound system all after you buy this smart screen set up yep how many of you have sat next to the speakers because you couldn't hear the tv audio clearly before i know i've done it a lot of times but with this smart screen you don't have to worry anymore because the audio quality is different level like how you said powella with the huawei vision series you don't have to worry about the sound at all i mean think about it 410 watt speakers man two high frequency speakers and two full frequency speakers confirm the sound also very nice i also did a test power with superhero movies you know one of those with a lot of noise and then the monster fight with the superhero and all that and believe me the audio experience was amazing come we'll show you guys what we mean by that [Music] hey hey joe yeah what are you watching one of my favorite action movies this was great great picture isn't it this is the power of the vision as 4k 120 hertz screen which have the ability of bringing things to life this is amazing plus from outside i can hear the bang bang bang bam boom that means you have a sweet home theater system somewhere take a look around yoola where i got home theater system and all uh it's all from the huawei vision as four 10 watt speakers in one that is right the sound very nice it's like i'm walking into a cinema plus you dim the lights laggy filled though yes because i know how to enjoy life and the huawei vision has really have the entertainment capabilities of letting you immerse into whatever you're watching or listening to okay guys we've seen the connectivity and entertainment now it's time for intelligence this smart screen has got all kinds of added advantages that other smart screens don't it's got harmony os this offers an ai live experience that enables the user to interact with their device on their own terms basically the vision s can be your personal assistant yep and it's got a one hop projection which lets you broadcast your phone to the huawei vision s by simply typing your phone to the remote remember the photos that we took just now yeah of course i look so good in that one yep no worries then because i'm gonna broadcast it to the whole wide world right now show up it's simple as that so handsome no more fiddling with settings and wasting time trying to configure things just tap and it's there up on the big screen it's so easy that even my armor knows how to use it confirm not only that joe it's also got mirror control essentially turning your smartphone into a remote for the vision s i think jojo's going to show yourself yeah there you go now you don't have to crack your head trying to search for something or spend too much time typing a name of a show out okay let me do a demonstration right now just use your smartphone's keyboard and voila get it easy peasy this also works especially well when you have a hard time finding your hidden remote control or when the remote control runs out of battery then you should just use your smartphone right that's the one thing i know you will never lose because it's always in your hand oh and if you're a music lover then you will definitely love this feature the screen of music mode let's show them how it works say you're chilling with your friends at home action okay and then we're relaxing right i yeah dim the lights and then bam i hit you with some magic hey celia screen off what even with the display of the screen can still play music that is so cool yeah so now it's just me and you and the music yeah no more distractions but wait a minute what if someone is trying to call you or if you're trying to call someone you still have to get up and reach out to your phone right watch hey celia call joe this is so cool nila can even hear you through the music that's just amazing thank you as you guys just saw the huawei vision s also comes with ai voice which basically means that if you're too lazy to use the remote you can just speak your command even if you're playing a movie or some music and celia will sort you right out all the things we've mentioned are great but it's made better by huawei integrating battle search while its first search tool that is supported across a few different devices this tool can help the user to look for all kinds of music videos and many other things and can even work with voice that's right and it also comes with huawei music and huawei video huawei video offers a user more than 10 000 hours of content featuring local partners such as astro and other

huawei vision series which are sold at most huawei experience stores near you yep get them quick guys honey yeah household okay i'm gonna get mine after this you follow me because i also want to join the campaign okay thanks for watching the launch of the huawei vision s series guys and remember huawei vision s series beyond a tv my name is hanifamza and my name is jojo goh signing out peace you what is up d tube so today i want to take a look at two of my favorite phones still to this date and obviously first on the right side we have the samsung galaxy s20 ultra with this like massive huge 100x zoom cam camera on on the back side and the this kind of like grayish sort of design here very very slippery on the sides but it would be a little better if it was less slippery because if you hold it like like this you can see it can kind of slide out of your hand and um if you're one thing so usually when the art is slippery they usually can like fall off a surface but just because this one has a kind of notch on the camera side which means that it doesn't really slide that easy on on a floor on a on something on like a table or something so that can kind of be good so the galaxy s20 ultra here and then i have this old school huawei mate 9 which still to this day is is one of my favorite huawei phones is because of how they did the the design you can see i have kind of like a cracked um front side here of it but besides that it's a fully functional device so the the thing that kind of why this specific huawei phone for me personally feels kind of unique and special is because of the design kind of like whatever material they used here on the back side it feels very very nice in your hand to hold and it feels very expensive and premium and also how this device over here this huawei mate 9 phone it has this kind of like weight nice weight in the hand kind of like the new the new i have felt the iphone 12 pro max in my hands and it also has the same kind of nice heavy kind of sort of feel to it uh also what i love about it is the the buttons here on the right side feels very robust and they have this nice kind of clicking sound to it so this is the power button and this is the volume up and down keys some other nice things it has an extremely it has an extremely comfortable feedback on the touch so i can feel the whole device like when when you feel a vibration you can feel it very intensely and that's also one of the main reasons why i kind of like this design i also kind of like so on the back side one of my favorite things here with this huawei phone is the this fingerprint sensor is super fast and it kind of goes inwards a little bit here so it's very very easy to find with um with your finger when you have the device like this it naturally goes right over here so perfect design for the the fingerprint kind of scanner over there um yeah i mean overall it's it's still in in in 2020 uh this is a very very capable device and um this um samsung phone that i bought uh march this year i haven't really been using it that much because i'm still using my samsung galaxy s10 plus a lot so i haven't really felt the need to kind of upgrade but it is super fast and obviously one of the coolest things about the samsung galaxy s20 ultra is when you go into display and you can go to motion smoothness you can go up to 120 hertz if you're willing to kind of lower the resolution a little bit so you have to lower it but then you can have an even more smooth display so if i go to full hd here and then i go into motion smoothness i can now select 120 hertz which gives like this ultra super super mega smooth um user interface and this is something that you can't get at the moment on on for example the huawei mate 9. so yeah it's really nice you can see here super super rapid yeah so quickly look here onto my favorite phones still to this day the huawei finally released web gallery their own keyboard celia so let's check it out [Music] hello everyone it's miros and today we'll check the new huawei keyboard celia so to do this first we will need to go to their own app gallery of course keep the advert and search for serial keyboard here it is and the first one celia keyboard let's check what's written about product description celia keyboard is a free keyboard application developed by huawei to improve the use accuracy and enjoyment of your typing it supports more than 170 languages and provides thousands of emojis cool phones smile faces and four simple keyboard themes all the features are written here but now we'll just check them so to test this keyboard we'll need to install it let's just tap install and wait but before we start if you are not already subscribed to my channel please do this now and hit that bell icon so you never miss a video let's jump in it's ready let's just open it step 1 enabling settings of course i have three keyboards including celia this is microsoft swiftkey and gboard by google and of course syria by huawei so i will just make a quick comparison between them but just enable it all right go back and select keyboard you need to select it and now let's just go through the setup process languages of course this is the important here you have lots of options we already say that but we have here 170 different languages and probably huawei will continue updating them so that number will increase slowly but now you have plenty of different languages so your language is one of these all right we have team here and we have just four teams and of course you can select a different fonts from here and of course the keyboard itself pop-up on key press show number row if you want a number row above your letters touch and hold delay you can edit that delay and show slide indicator display visual cue when sliding from the shift or symbol keys and you have here a small keyboard icon if you tap it the keyboard will appear here you can see pretty standard keyboard with the language bar here on the bottom we have here an input gesture typing show gesture tray auto capitalization next word suggestion auto correction i will disable this for a purpose of our test emoji predictions double space period and quick prediction insert touch spacebar to insert the middle prediction alright sometime vibration vibrate on key press key press volume here you can move your cursor for vibration and for the volume something which i miss here is that there is no option to select use system default because for all my keyboards i always use system default vibration let's go back and here you can check that our version is 1.0.1.301 and that's the latest one of course guys link for that keyboard will be in video description all right let's just test the keyboard let's open that notepad and here now we have our silly keyboard something which i don't like is when you tap here on the language button there is a pop-up message to select your language it not automatically change your language because it will be faster and this is one step more you need to select english tap again select bulgarian tap again english it will be quicker if you just tap here and it will just switch the languages if you tap here on that small keyboard icon it will bring you more options you have here layout qrt keywords other t and different layouts of keyboards you have here mod standard one-handed mod which will bring the keyboard to left side or right side floating keyboard let's select it you can see what happened let's just move it to standard and a thumb keyboard which will just separate the keyboard onto different areas and the other thing which is very important for me is resize and from here you can resize and move your keyboard you can make it bigger you can just move it up or down which is very important for me because with this big screens on our phones i always feel the need to move the keyboard a little bit higher which is the option which i like a lot on microsoft swiftkey keyboard and that's the option which i miss on gboard and this is the main disadvantage of g board for me but here on celia keyboard we have that option thanks huawei all right let's just mark it and check the other options team we already checked them we have just four teams probably huawei will continue update them and soon we'll have more what else we have here a clipboard here if you tap on a clipboard you will just see all your clipboard of the text which you select it will be here what we have here text editing this is how you can select the text and edit it select all copy paste and everything just with these buttons like a remote control personally i like more the way which swift keyboard uses just type something here you just need to tap here and select text editing and from here you can move and edit your text let's just switch to microsoft swiftkey and here is the text and now if you hold your finger on the interval you can just drag your finger and select the letter which you want to edit that's what i mean now let's switch again to cellular keyboard and check the other options so sound and vibration we already checked up what we have here anything else is settings you will go here to settings which we already checked and here the interesting thing is mechanical keyboard if you tap here and now if you enable that mechanical keyboard you have three different options clicky tactile and linear this is just like every mechanical keyboard i hope you can hear what happened here that's a clicky let's check to tactile and planar so i really like this option for mechanical keyboard this is celia mine advantage for now so let's just leave it with that mechanical option all the keys will look like just a mechanical keyboard you can see how it will look like with this 3d keys just like a mechanical keyboard we can make a quick test now and compare these three keyboards first let's go to g board and just type the famous sentence the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog first will be gboard guys remember i disable autocorrect for all the three keyboards pretty much without any mistake so this was the g board let's check now swift keyboard and let's reach it microsoft street keyboard and let's write again the same sentence [Music] as you can see the quick brown folks junos over the lazy dick i have two mistakes here with swift keyboard which is my daily keyboard now let's move to cylia and let's write here of course we need to switch it celia keyboard with the mechanical layout and let's just type that sentence [Music] and you can see without any mistake i write the sentence the quick brown folks jumps over the lazy dog that was it guys if you like this video don't forget to subscribe my channel and

the World, a channel to find a real China. Today, we would like to talk about the Harmony
OS by Hua Wei on June 2, 2021, a special day destined to be remembered by the Chinese people. In mandarin, Harmony OS is called Hongmeng. When it debuted at the Huawei Developer Conference
two years ago, many people were skeptical about whether it would succeed or survive. With the official launch of Harmony OS 2.0
for mobile phones and other terminals, all doubts have been dispelled. Harmony OS is the first Chinese mobile operating
system and a revolutionary generation of operating systems because it aims at the IoT (Internet
of Things). Twenty years ago, Microsoft Windows dominated
the PC Internet era. Over a decade ago, Apple and Google controlled
the mobile Internet era with iOS and Android. But in the face of the coming I o T, Internet
of Everything era, they gradually feel the strain. Microsoft failed in the competition of the
mobile operating systems. Apple had to develop Mac OS, iOS, and watch
OS to meet different hardware needs. In the future, with the increasing number
of IoT devices, this painstaking development model will reach a dead end. Using the same system and adapting to different
hardware has become the dream of more than 27 million developers worldwide. And the Harmony OS is on the right way toward
that dream. Different hardware equipped with HarmonyOS
can get connected automatically: self-discovering and self-connecting without installing cumbersome
applications. Take our daily life as an example. In the morning, we open our eyes at 6:30,
and a song starts when we begin making breakfast. When we walk from one room to another, the
background music switches without interruption. When we fall asleep at night, the smartwatch
will automatically turn off the lights and adjust the bedroom temperature. Harmony OS is the next generation of the operating
system after PC Internet and mobile Internet. What makes Harmony OS so intelligent? First, it uses a revolutionary microkernel
architecture. Compared with the traditional macro kernel,
the microkernel retains only the most basic scheduling and memory management, while other
functions are modularized into different services and put into the outer kernel part to be called
on-demand. For example, an intelligent speaker needs
only voice functionality, and a camera needs only video functionality. Such a microkernel architecture allows HarmonyOS
to adapt to different devices with memories ranging from GB to KB. Even weak devices like light bulbs can join
the Harmony OS network. As good as the microkernel is, how do devices
with different functions communicate efficiently and work as the same device? It has been a complex problem for the industry. Developers from Hua Wei, which benefit from
the company's communications background, creatively proposed the distributed soft bus technology
to achieve a seamless connection between devices. Under such a decentralized system, various
manufacturers can modularize their hardware capabilities of different devices like building
Lego and then combine and call them at will. For example, by connecting the drone camera
to a cell phone, anyone can get a bird's eye view of the world without leaving the ground. In the past years, the Chinese have built
many phenomenal applications in the mobile Internet era, such as Alipay, WeChat, QQ,
Ridesharing, Food Delivery Platforms, to name a few only. But behind the prosperity, it is difficult
to hide an embarrassment: the "root" of these applications, that is, the operating system,
belongs to someone else. Many people have been used to such a situation. But there is one person who has shown his
concern: Huawei needs to have its own operating system. But at that time, Huawei's business was still
mainly telecom equipment, the demand for a dedicated operating system was not very strong. Wang Chenglu's idea could only stay on paper. After the year 2016, as Huawei's consumer
business surged, the demand for its own operating system could no longer be ignored. Hua Wei used Google's Android to manufacture
its mobile phones, just like all other phone manufacturers in China. Every year, Google holds an Android conference
in Hong Kong, and Hua Wei is the cell phone manufacturer with the most ideas, thus greatly
promoting the innovation of Android. Google also attaches great importance to Huawei's
opinions, but limited to the architecture, Android often does not fully meet Huawei's
needs. For example, how to collaborate between multiple
devices under one system? Because of this gap in demand, Huawei had
the idea of making a new system. And Wang Chengdu became the most important
promoter. But to spend a lot of money on a software
system within a vendor like Huawei, which has a tradition of hardware, it is crucial
to gather internal consensus. The first thing that needed to be done was
to convince Ren Zhengfei. To this end, Wang Chenglu patiently waited
for the right moment. It wasn't until 2018 that Ren Zhengfei felt
at risk because the consumer business was growing so fast and decided to listen to reports
from each department in that business one by one. Wang Chenglu felt that the opportunity had
come. So, while doing a debriefing at the Beijing
Research Institute, he seized the opportunity and told Ren Zhengfei if Huawei wants to be
a $100 billion business in the future, it needs to have its own operating system. The more significant the consumer business
is, the greater the risk will be without an independent operating system to support it. It's too dangerous to have it in someone else's
hands. In Wang Chenglu's opinion, "if you build a
house on someone else's foundation, it will not stand the storm even if it is grand and
beautiful. Eventually, Ren Zhengfei was impressed by
his words. In May of that year, the Harmony OS project
started internally. Wang Chenglu had a long way to go, and the
talent issue was the key. At that time, millions of software developers
in China were working on applications development, and few could do system architecture and underlying
development. Wang Chenglu had to go to the US Research
Institutes to recruit people and slowly train the team in China. Sometimes, he would hire some people who did
not have a scientific background. Those outsiders can think out of the box. Wang Chenglu himself is not an IT guy. In an interview, Wang Chenglu confessed that
the idea of a distributed soft-bus architecture might be rejected by people who hold computer
science designations. This idea of decentralization later became
the core of the Harmony OS. The Chinese have been looking forward to an
operating system of their own for decades. Under the impetus of this consensus, many
domestic operating systems such as Red Flag Linux and Blue Point Linux came into being. The older generation of scientists actively
promotes the localization of operating systems, because only when Chinese people own the underlying
technology, can China's Internet industry have a solid foundation and true prosperity. In the words of Wang Chenglu, prosperity without
roots will not last. China's operating systems have failed again
and again, and the key is the software ecology. For an OS to survive and succeed, a 16% market
share is a threshold. Currently, the market share of all domestic
operating systems combined is less than 8%. HarmonyOS is the first Chinese operating system
that is expected to break through this life and death line. According to Huawei's plan, by the end of
this year, there will be 300 million devices equipped with HarmonyOS, including 200 million
of its own terminals and 100 million devices from other partners. Many people ridicule HarmonyOS as another
Android in a different skin because HarmonyOS uses codes from the Android Open Source Project
(AOSP). The truth is that AOSP and Android are completely
different things. AOSP is the contribution of global developers
and is open source, and Hua Wei has contributed a lot. In the future, HarmonyOS will get rid of this
part as well. Google wouldn't be in a hurry to speed up
the development of cross-platform Fuchsia OS, the next-generation operating system,
if HarmonyOS is only a copy of Android. In this regard, Wang Chenglu also repeatedly
stressed: "We are not making a replacement for Android or iOS." The implication is that HarmonyOS is aiming
much higher than that: it wants to be the next-generation operating system. HarmonyOS is gaining support from more and
more manufacturers, especially home appliance companies, such as Midea, Jiuyang, Boss and
other home appliance brands. Just a few days ago, Meizu, a Chinese phone
manufacturer, announced to embrace HarmonyOS. In the past two decades, China has lost the
PC era and the mobile Internet era in terms of operating systems. Now, in the I o T era, it finally has the
opportunity to outcompete other players. In the words of Wang Chenglu: If HarmonyOS
succeeds, the next 20 years of the mobile industry will belong to China. Put your comments below, if you have other

china's actual 5g development according to the data china mobile has 205 205.3 million 5g subscribers china telecom has 117.8 million subscribers and china unicom has 98.6 million subscribers which means the total number of chinese 5g subscribers is about 420 million this is an increase of about 220 million or 110 from the beginning of the year as beijing claims china's 5g penetration rate has now reached 26 making it the country with the largest 5g network penetration rate and the largest number of 5g users in the world while everyone is cheering for the boom of the 5g network in china a secret has been unintentionally released the above data shows that the combined number of users for the three operators has reached 420 million however the cumulative 5g handset sales in china are only about 270 million units as of april according to the national ict academy as we all know there are three conditions that need to be met in order to enjoy 5g networks a 5g smartphone an established 5g network and a 5g package provided by telecom providers therefore this could mean that 150 million or 35.7 percent of the chinese users are actually not using 5g why is this we interviewed mr wong a friend who lives in mainland china through the phone he said many telecom providers are trying to get as many users to upgrade to 5g as possible in order to popularize 5g networks which is a state goal of beijing however they did not do it in a conventional way when 5g was first launched providers dramatically reduced the speed of the 4g network and then claimed to the users that 5g network could be faster and have less traffic attracting a group of users was high speed internet demand on the other hand the providers continue to promote 5g packages by cold calls which would cause many to eventually buy the plan because of the constant pestering for those who insisted on not using 5g the sales staff will ask you whether you are willing to upgrade to 5g for free in order to access the services in the future and retain the same plan for now they were counted as 5g users as well this is probably why there are 150 million people who do not have 5g phones but are considered 5g users however the false user data has created an apparent prosperity of 5g in china what is more worrying is whether china 5g itself is a bubble or a scam in recent years 5g has been hyped up so much in china that people are beginning to imagine what life will be like when the 5g era arrives from virtual driving to smart homes to remote virtual surgery moreover was favored policy and support from beijing huawei the largest 5g chinese manufacturer is also advertised as a national pride according to chinese media reports china has now built the world's largest 5g network with about 810 000 5g base stations in operation accounting for more than 70 percent of the world's share making it a worthy pioneer of 5g networks worldwide undeniably 5g technology is certainly an improvement compared to 4g it can provide higher bandwidth higher capacity lower latency and faster wireless data services but the disadvantages of 5g technology is also very obvious there are two types of 5g technology one is slightly better than the existing 4g called the sub 65g which is now the most widely commercialized 5g there is another type called the millimeter wave 5g which can provide greater capacity and faster network speed than the sub 65g but has not yet been commercialized there are some even more obvious problems with 5g sub 65g compared to 4g due to the higher frequency used has a shorter transmission distance resulting in a smaller transmission range lack of penetration and could easily be blocked by obstacles even within the same building there will be a relatively large gap in network speed in different places similarly the transmission distance of 5g base stations is only one-third that of 4g to achieve the same coverage of 4g more stations need to be installed by the operator generally the number of 5g base stations installed in the same area will be 1.5 to 2 times that of 4g for example shanghai minhang district is china's first gigabit 5g demonstration area with 26 base stations per square kilometer according to the plan about 50 base stations per square kilometer need to be installed to achieve full coverage the second disadvantage of 5g is that the construction cost of stations is very high although the cost of one station has dropped from 600 000 yen to 400 thousand ran recently it is still 65 higher than that of 4g base stations a report from a chinese statistical agency shows that it will take at least five years for operators to build a mature 5g network in china which means covering most medium-sized cities and the investment will be hundreds of billions of dollars if it wants to be as popular as the 4g network it will take at least a trillion yen what's worse is that the telecom providers have not yet fully recovered from their investments in the 4g network construction in the 4g era the cumulative investment of china mobile alone reached 450 billion yen if they wish to upgrade to the high-end millimeter wave 5g which has a base station coverage of only about 100 meters the investment will reach more than 10 trillion for constructing stations alone if they decide to take out a bank loan the operator's profits will never be enough to repay the interest data shows the number of 5g base stations built in more than 2 years is only comparable to the 4g base stations built in the first year during the 4g era this can probably explain the difference in terms of investment the third shortcoming of 5g is that its equipment consumes a huge amount of electricity resulting in exceptionally high running costs according to data provided by china tower the average power consumption of a 5g outdoor base station is about 3.8 kilowatts more than 3 times that of a 4g base station some experts estimate that if 5g achieves 4g coverage the cost of electricity alone for operators will be 6 to 12 times that of 4g according to the latest data from the gsma china now has more than 810 000 5g stations assuming that the three major carriers turn on all the completed 5g stations and that all 5g base stations are shared among the three carriers and will cost about 19.2 billion yen a year in electricity bills alone considering that the sharing rate of stations is now 80 percent the actual cost for the three carriers will be higher than this such a high operational cost has already forced the operators to shut down 5g base stations when idle currently many 5g stations in china are shut down from 9 pm to am the next day while the providers explain that 5g base stations are smart and will automatically shut down or reduce capacity when the number of users are low in order to save energy the chairman of one of the three major carriers unicom admitted in an interview that this was a desperate move to save electricity if the planned 2 million base stations were to be completed it would cost 24 billion yen a year in electricity alone which is two times unicom's annual profit from the data it can be concluded that the more stations are built the more laws for providers if full 5g coverage is achieved electricity costs alone will be many times the operator's current annual profits even if only one percent of the country is covered electricity costs will be more than enough to bankrupt the three major operators which means 5g is not so sustainable from the financial reports of the three carriers you can see how they've been suffering from the costs even the largest among them china mobile could not bear the costs of 5g equipment it is currently integrating 5g to the original 4g network and could not establish an independent 5g network what about the consumers do they really find 5g attractive first of all due to the imperfection of 5g infrastructure the coverage of 5g is far from universal so the user's experience is relatively poor and far from ideal in fact many users switch back to 4g shortly after secondly the price of 5g packages are higher than 4g which is already considered somewhat expensive by most people and most users would not need such high speed internet moreover most of the current smartphone apps are still based on the 4g network and the speed is more than enough so why would users choose to spend more and switch to 5g last year china's former finance minister low g wei has pointed out in the media interview that 5g development still has many obstacles among them he said the three major problems would be immature technology high costs and low applicability in addition he questioned how operators are blindly repeating the 4g network construction model and trying to obtain wide area coverage when in fact it's simply not applicable to [Music] the above interview is blocked by most chinese social media platforms but cannot stop the brewing suspicion of chinese innocence some people began to question the over hype of 5g and the actual feasibility of the projects in addition huawei was unable to obtain high-end chips due to the u.s sanctions suffering from lower revenue and reduced marketing expenses this caused the publicity of 5g to drop in china as well mr wong who we interviewed said the providers are trying to attract users back to the 4g plans by lowering the prices he also noted that the 4g package he was using was originally 98 yuan per month but when he tried to end the contract the mobile company gave him a discount to 68 um per month along with a higher bandwidth besides the obstacles that generally exist in the chinese market china's 5g is also facing a blockage from the upcoming rapid development of 6g last october the united states telecommunications industries solutions alliance announced the formation of the next g alliance and that 11 new members including apple and google had joined the 6g alliance the alliance now has 21 members including ericsson facebook intel microsoft nokia qualcomm samsung and other telecom companies from around the world they are ready to promote north american mobile technology leadership in 6g and beyond in the next decade while facilitating the long-term evolution of 5g it is worth mentioning that chinese companies including huawei and zte have not been invited to join the alliance as reported by an article from cena finance pushing the 5g industrial network within china will not help chinese manufacturing but may even hinder it the report suggested if chinese companies implement 5g industrial network it will lead to a significant increase in production costs china's manufacturing industry has a low profitability and relies on the large trade surplus to generate value for the economy the increased costs will result in exporters who are already struggling to lose their advantages to compete with manufacturing in india africa and other emerging economies halting china's foreign exchange revenue the awkward situation that 5g is currently in is leaving operators in a dilemma perhaps in a few years when we look back at 5g we may find that it is far from what was advertised the fairy tale that is 5g may just be a fantasy blown up by equipment manufacturers or simply a scam [Music] you Hey what’s up? Sami here. Today I’m going to talk about Harmony OS
2.0 and why I think this OS is the future. In this video I will cover what’s new about
Harmony OS 2.0, what’s special about it, and my conclusion. I’ve spent a lot of time and energy on this
video and I’ve got to say maybe this is the only video that you need to know about
the truth of Harmony OS, so please show some support for my channel by hitting that subscribe
button, turning on the notification bell, and giving this video a thumbs up! Your support is the true motivation for me
to put continuous effort to my future videos. So first let’s check out what’s new about
Harmony OS 2.0. You may have seen many tech reviewers say
oh, it’s basically Android 10 and looks almost the same as Huawei’s previous EMUI
OS without too much new stuff. Is that true? Now I’m going to tell you yes, it’s true
and a big no. Let me explain. Why not start with the new features. On the home page, you swipe down from the
left side you will see the notifications. Swipe down from the right side, you get to
see the control panel. One big thing is you click the music playing
widget on the top left corner, you can play music from all music apps that are on the
phone without actually opening the app. You see the background apps don’t include
any music apps. And this feature can be seen everywhere in
the Harmony OS. It can be seen as a microcosm of Harmony OS
concept, which are minimalistic, systematic, and de-applicationized. Actually, I’m not sure the last word is
a real word or not, but I bet you know what I mean. Under that are the shortcuts just like any
other Android phone. You can quickly disable or enable some features
by tapping the icon there, nothing new. What’s really new here is the Super Device
section. You can drag a device onto this device to
connect to it or handoff task. We’ll mainly elaborate on this later as
this is the most important part. Let’s keep exploring what’s new here. You slightly swipe up on an app to
get a snippet. You can pin it to your phone interface. You can long-press to remove or choose different
snippets to display it. You see what Huawei is trying to do here? They try to modularize everything that lets
you access your most-used apps even easier and faster. Like before if you want to buy something from
an app, you first open the app, close the ads and then search, now you just swipe and
search. You can also enlarge a folder so you can click
the app directly. Don’t need to click the folder specifically. There are also other changes like new UI or
animation, here I’m not going to show every detail about it, otherwise, this video would
be endless. The thing is here you might ask: despite all
those changes, what’s the fundamental difference between the already existed Android system? That’s a good question but have you ever
thought about it? The Harmony OS is a totally new OS that gives
no additional learning cost burden for its users, isn't it amazing? But then you may ask so that’s just another
Android system with new UI designs. That’s not right, the core concept of HarmonyOS
is to eliminate the limitations of Android and hardware devices. Now let me fully explain the Super Device
feature. I will use the tablet, laptop, watch, and
TV to demonstrate this. Let’s start with the MatePad Pro. You drag the MatePad Pro onto your phone under
the Super Device interface, wait for a few seconds, and then will be connected. Then you will have a Super Device of phone
and pad. You can do whatever you want for your phone
on the pad! Watching videos or full-screen videos wouldn’t
be an issue. Want to type long text? No problem, and the content is syncing on
your phone! And if you want to exit just drag the MatePad
Pro icon out of the circle. Now for the Super Device of tablet and laptop. Huawei offers three modes between the two. First is mirroring. This mode enables you to project the content
from the laptop directly to the tablet. Second is extending. you use your laptop as a secondary screen. What’s the smart here is it detects the
tablet position automatically whether you put it to the left or right and you drag the
files accordingly. One good thing I can think of for this mode
is when I’m working, I can use my tablet to watch some videos and when the boss is
coming, I can quickly turn off the video and pretend to work hard. This is good. Third is sharing. You can drag any files between the two. There are many benefits for this like you
can use all applications from both the laptop and tablet simultaneously, which will improve
your working efficiency greatly because sometimes you want to draw something on your laptop
and now you can do that on your tablet and drag the files to it once finished. And for the smartwatch, as the display is
small and maybe the only thing you need from it is just some critical information so you
don’t need to stare at your phone all the time while doing sports or other tasks. Now let’s move to something even bigger
like Huawei MateView and TV. You see the MateView display just uses my
phone’s computing power to let me do everything on it, and I can use my phone separately at
the same time! And TV, you can enjoy a much better way to
communicate with your family members or friends. After all these I guess we truly understand
the core concept of Harmony OS here, namely, to eliminate the restrictions or limitations
of a single hardware device and let each fully present its advantages. It lets your phone device fully present its
mobile communication advantage, your tablet fully present its drawing advantage, your
computer fully present its input advantage, and your TV fully present its big screen advantage,
or your watch present its compact advantage when you are not convenient to check your
phone. It’s not about changing a few UIs or adding
a few animations, it’s about an ideal life that’s not going to entrap or be limited
by a certain amount of devices, it unites everything in one and lets you enjoy life. You see Harmony OS is unlike Android or iOS,
it’s not a replacement for them. Before, we had one OS for one type of device. Like Windows for PC, Android and iOS for smartphones,
but now we have so many smart devices, it’s such a burden to do one OS for each type of
device. Users will find it’s overwhelming too, not
convenient. Therefore, cross-platform and cross-device
interaction is a problem that all manufacturers want to solve. Google is trying to develop next OS, the Fuchsia,
Apple is trying to use its in-house chipset to fuse its ecosystem. And for Huawei, Harmony OS is their answer
for the future OS. And that’s why I think Huawei Harmony OS
is the future, is our new hope. Alright, that’s the video, I hope it has
helped you in some way, please let me know what you think in the comments section. And don’t forget to subscribe! I’m Sami and I will see you in the next
one. what's up guys everyone here with kukatek and huawei has been one of the few companies that are still offering android tablets in the market earlier this year they released yet another iteration on their tablet line the huawei mate but 10.4 it packs a 7250 milliamp hour battery with support for fast charging kirin 810 cpu and a decent 10.4 inch panel so without any further ado let's go ahead and unbox this device [Music] opening up the box we are greeted with the tablet itself underneath that are its charging brick usb type-c cable user manual and a warranty cord and a 3.5 millimeter two usb type-c dongle for buttons and ports situated on the left side when held in landscape orientation are a sleep wake button and a pair of speakers while usb type c port and another pair of speaker grilles are on the right micro sd card slot at the bottom and volume rockers and an array of microphone at the top situated on the top of the display are its front facing camera and an led indicator the back is made out of a matte textured finish although it is a little bit of a fingerprint magnet also found here are its single camera setup coupled with an led flash and a huawei branding the third we have is in the grey colorway but it is also available in white in the hands given its size it feels light at 450 grams it also feels solid and robust giving it a more rugged feel on the display side of things it boasts a 10.4 inch ips lcd panel a 2000 by 1200 resolution capable of producing 224 ppi enough for binge watching contents on netflix and youtube the bezels are quite thick but it isn't bothersome it's also got a tall screen real estate making it comfortable to hold when reading ebooks and script for performance it's got a kirin 810 cpu coupled with a mali g52 gpu up to four gigabytes of ram and 128 gigs of internal storage which is also expandable via the micro sd card slot for cameras it's got an 8 megapixel rear camera sensor with an led flash and an 8 megapixel software camera quality is not excellent but it will suffice your casual social media postings and zoom conferences when it comes to its software it runs on android 10 skinned with emui 10. no google play services here though but most of the apps you probably need are available on the huawei gallery for battery it's got a massive 7250 milliamp hours with support for 8 and what fast charging unfortunately there's no form of biometrics present so you'll have to rely on the more traditional way of unlocking this device which is via passcode the huawei matepad 10.4 is priced at 14 249 pesos 44 gigabytes of ram plus 64 gigs of internal storage with sim card slot and 18 999 pesos 44 gigabytes of ram plus 128 gigs of internal storage configuration the new huawei mate pads are available in all huawei concept stores and official shoppi and lazada flagship stores so what do you guys think about the huawei mate by 10.4 let us know in the comment section below and if you enjoyed this video be sure to drop a like subscribe to our channel for more content hit that bell so you don't miss any future uploads and be sure to visit yougotek.com for the latest tech news and reviews this has been real and i'll catch you guys in the next one hi everyone i'm kieran and welcome to gizmo china you may remember huawei's flagship wireless earbuds with active noise cancelling the free butts pro which was one of the best noise cancelling earbuds that we ever reviewed if you never saw the review video before please feel free to check it out but today we bring you guys another latest product in huawei's free bud series the free buds 4i and now without further ado let's get right into the earbuds i'm quite fond of the styling of the freebutt's 4i it has a very round shape like a pebble the back of the charging case looks like it was cut down to reduce the area although it looks like a surface that supports wireless charging it doesn't it's just a design that allows you to stably place the case on the desk but considering the cheaper price tag than the freebutts pro the lack of wireless charging is somewhat acceptable with equally excellent performance in other departments on the side there is a pairing button and at the bottom it has a type c charging port one thing i really appreciate is that the charging case is as small as the airpods pros which is much smaller than the free buds 3i and freebuds pros cases and also its rounded shape is very comfortable to hold in your hand or to put in your pocket open the case we can see that the earbuds design is consistent with the case which looks like a combination of the freebus 3i and freebutts pro compared to the freebutts pro the overall design is rounded with no corners visible and the 4i comes with a new red color variant no doubt the design can be much more popular with female users as for earfit it's pretty comfortable to wear and does not fall off easily even for someone who has small ears the proper cavity design of the earbuds causes no obvious discomfort even when wearing for a long time earbuds are very easy to use double click on either one of the earbuds to play or pause the music a long press on the left or right stick to switch noise cancelling modes other than that you can also go to the official app to reset the earbuds operation you want the biggest surprise is that the freebot's 4i's noise cancelling is not compromised by its price with active noise cancellation on it still isolates noise well and is not a lot weaker than the other expensive noise cancelling earbuds the sound quality is also not bad like most high end earbuds it supports up to aac bluetooth decoding specifically the freebuds 4i is outstanding at the delivery of high frequencies while the bass is relatively less impressive the latency performance of the 4i is pretty good on most android devices but as an earbud product developed by huawei it's naturally better when connected to a huawei device rather than my verbal description it's better to hear for yourself how much of a difference in latency there is when connecting to a huawei model and another phone the official app for set up the 4i is ai life which has all the usual functions so we won't dwell on them if you are interested you can refer to our free buds pro video one point i have to compliment huawei on is the 4i also features seamless switching between devices which works similar to the feature i mentioned in the samsung galaxy buds pro review it's a feature that will make it easy for people who have to work with two devices and now you don't need to pay a premium price for flagship earbuds for this great feature as you can enjoy it on the cheaper freebutts 4i so that's all the important details that we want to share with you about the latest free buds 4i it's well worth your money for only half the price of the free buds pro you can have 90 of the features with a more portable design if you're looking for less expensive wireless earbuds but don't want to miss out on too many features it could definitely be one of your options due to its elegant and compact design we strongly recommend it to female users and if you're a huawei phone owner this is an even better choice for you so that was it for huawei freebot's 4i review please remember to subscribe to our channel if you want to see more latest tech gadgets thanks for watching this is kieran from gizmo china and we'll see you soon [Music] [Applause] [Music] hi guys it's asbury and this is the huawei mate x2 in my opinion from a hardware point of view the best smartphone tablet available right now i mean how cool is that but whatever your opinions on this political matter there's no denying ever since the relationship breakdown between the u.s and china and huawei and subsequent google bans it's always been the software side of things that have left many customers consumers you guys wondering whether to buy huawei smartphones or not the good news is there are ways around this potential problem if you are desperate for this brilliant piece of hardware and i'll explain exactly what i mean shortly but first let's look at the hardware and if you enjoy this video and want to see more drop a like and sub if you're new so straight away huawei of course after watching my video on their last folding phone the xs have switched their latest folding device from folding outwards to folding inwards a far better idea in my opinion for protecting the delicate display the decision to do that definitely wasn't because of my video but they have made the change and it's a welcome one it was one of the main reasons why i thought the galaxy zed fold 2 from samsung was the better option last year crucially though this year when folded the huawei mate x2 and its 6.45 15x9 90hz oled outer display resembles a standard normal phone and this was one of my biggest negatives of that galaxy zedfold 2. the outer display was just too narrow to fully function as a normal phone which i personally think with these sorts of devices it should be phone first tablet second because i would use this probably as much if not more than actually diving in and using the inner display for media consumption etc so the x2 fold is spot on here the outer display is interrupted by a dual camera cutout providing a 16 megapixel shooter and a timer flight sensor now i've said this before such as the quality of smartphone camera software technology these days for making those lovely blurred background portrait shots etc from a single lens i don't really feel the trade-offs from interrupting that display from having the dual cut out outweighs the timer flight sensors capabilities i personally would prefer to see them go with just a single camera cut out to have more display but that's just me if we flip to the back we have a quad camera setup consisting of a 50 megapixel primary a 16 megapixel ultra wide and two telephoto lenses one with three times and the other with ten times optical zoom and periscoping design now huawei phones over the last few years have been famed for having some of the very best cameras around and the mate x2 is no different i mean it's basically the same setup as their other flagship phones like the p40 pro plus etc so excellent but not necessarily the main reason why you would probably prob probably probably and possibly probably would go and buy this phone this reason of course is and this is something that you're always told when you're growing up as a kid it's what's inside that counts so when you do unfold the mate x2 you're greeted with an 8 inch display with pretty much square design it's a really nice bright and vibrant flexible oled panel and it's also 90 hertz so everything feels really nice and smooth when you're scrolling and consuming content and the actual fold crease is really hard to see you can see it but it certainly doesn't take away from the experience and the hinge is really spot on it feels really nice and durable a real hefty clamp to it very secure good job now you may have noticed so far that when it's actually folded outwards there's an angular design to it where the left hand side as you look at it is actually ever so slightly thinner which according to huawei is for better weight distribution so it feels lighter when holding it with one hand which is great if you're right-handed like me but if you're left-handed it has the opposite effect it actually feels heavier so great if you're right-handed not so great if you're a lefty now the extra screen real estate comes in really handy for multitasking and just for anything that would be better suited for a larger display using maps viewing photos and emails etc the square shape like with the galaxy z fold 2 still sometimes feels a little bit off for watching movies for example as you will still get black bars on 16x9 content obviously and there are some apps that work fine but others that aren't yet quite compatible with this square ratio either i'm sure that will improve over time as developers will continue to update their software to include foldables such as these on their apps um but that brings me on to the the big talking point again here and that is software as a whole so this foldable is running on android 10 with emui 11 over the top it's not my favorite software and it still has a little way to go for me to match the likes of oneplus oxygen os samsung's one ui and good old plain stock android from google of course but it is improving year on year and with the mate x2 5 nanometer kirin 9000 chip and 8 gigabytes of ram it absolutely crushes the day-to-day tasks and such things as gaming on this tablet like display is an absolute joy but as stated unless you use the workaround which we'll touch on there's currently no google apps on here no google services no google play store so you download your apps in a different way and certain things are not compatible so if you don't go down the teased workaround what do you actually get standard on the phone well firstly you have huawei's app gallery tons of apps covers a lot of bases but not all to top this up you can use huawei's petal search feature a really handy tool for searching for and downloading nearly all the apps you're missing from the app gallery including some google ones but still not all the final way to use the remainder of google apps that aren't available is of course to use a browser shortcut save to your home screen like a an app usable fine for most people but not ideal if you did want fully functioning google services google play store all the google apps that you would potentially want to use there are ways of doing it and there are plenty of tutorials here on youtube where you can do it now without having to use a usb dongle connect it with someone could love it connecting it to a computer etc you can do it just from downloading one or two different apps and it is very simple i have used it on a couple of my huawei p and huawei mate series phones and google works completely fine so it is an option you can go down it's not something that why we actually recommend but if you're desperate for google apps then it works of course do your own research do your own due diligence just like you would downloading any app or apk on an android phone from an unknown source now battery life may be a slight concern here we do have a 4 500 mah battery cell but it does have to power this large 90 hertz display the other 90 hertz display on the other side both together and i haven't been able to fully test it but i would imagine it's something that you may not be the most excited about in terms of its performance um luckily you do have 55 watts fast charging with it which of course comes available inside the retail box and huawei have been known for having really great fast charging in their recent set of devices so charging speeds if you do need to top it up are going to be great so it may alleviate some of that problem for you side mounted fingerprint scanner on the power button works really nice and snappy and the stereo speakers are really impressive also adding to that content consumption experience so is the huawei mate x2 currently the best foldable smartphone available on the market right now in my opinion from a hardware point of view absolutely 100 it's a fantastic device it's incredibly futuristic it feels very solid it gives you great options to use as a normal phone and a tablet all at the same time a joy to use in fact i was one of the early skeptics about foldable devices i didn't really see where they were going to go with it it didn't seem practical they've absolutely nailed that with this and if they can possibly shrink it down a little bit in terms of thickness and weight without losing that added battery life then i think we could be on to something with absolutely huge potential if they can get the price right going forwards i i think we could generally see a move away from standard smartphones i really do but from a software point of view with the mate x2 i'm still a bit split i can't openly say for everyone it's great because a lot of people won't want the faf of downloading google services yourself or simply going without it but on the flip side if you are somebody who loves to have a tink around with their devices and want to customize it in your own way or indeed don't use google services because a lot of people actually don't use google apps then this is a fantastic device for you if you can afford the hefty price tag like and share if you enjoyed the video and found it helpful subscribe if you're new to the channel and love everything tech i love you leave you i'll see you next [Music] time so far the promise of foldable phones so far the promise of foldable phones has been more beta than blockbuster has been more beta than blockbuster although huawei is making a stronger although huawei is making a stronger case for these bendy gadgets case for these bendy gadgets taking the movement a step closer to the taking the movement a step closer to the mainstream with the recent launch of its mainstream with the recent launch of its third generation foldable third generation foldable [Music] [Music] you're looking at the mate x2 it costs you're looking at the mate x2 it costs nearly three thousand dollars and was nearly three thousand dollars and was launched in china launched in china only earlier this year after using it only earlier this year after using it for a week i can say it's probably the for a week i can say it's probably the best foldable phone best foldable phone hardware around it has some excellent hardware around it has some excellent cameras too along with cameras too along with other top shelf specs but going beyond other top shelf specs but going beyond that it demonstrates the potential of that it demonstrates the potential of foldable phones and foldable phones and where it might take the industry where it might take the industry admittedly admittedly it's not perfect but i'll get into that it's not perfect but i'll get into that later on for those watching my videos later on for those watching my videos for the first time some housekeeping for the first time some housekeeping know that huawei sent me the mate x2 on know that huawei sent me the mate x2 on loan and by the time you're watching loan and by the time you're watching this video this video it will have been sent back or to it will have been sent back or to another reviewer another reviewer now let's start with the most obvious now let's start with the most obvious part the design and displays part the design and displays this year huawei put the mate x2 through this year huawei put the mate x2 through a samsung inspired redesign a samsung inspired redesign the device opens and closes like a book the device opens and closes like a book instead of folding outwards like last instead of folding outwards like last year's mate x year's mate x the switch and design also means mate x2 the switch and design also means mate x2 has two screens instead of one has two screens instead of one starting with the 6.45 inch outer panel starting with the 6.45 inch outer panel which also has a notch housing two which also has a notch housing two front-facing cameras front-facing cameras it's the size of a regular phone so it it's the size of a regular phone so it can be relied on for day-to-day use can be relied on for day-to-day use without needing to open without needing to open up and there's of course the second up and there's of course the second inner display it's eight inches and it's inner display it's eight inches and it's as big as a tablet and is entirely free as big as a tablet and is entirely free of notches of notches and this is where the real fun begins and this is where the real fun begins with mate x2 with mate x2 especially if you're a big screen lover especially if you're a big screen lover and even if you're not and even if you're not it's tough not to marvel at its inner it's tough not to marvel at its inner screen and the engineering feat it screen and the engineering feat it represents represents key to the redesign is the so-called key to the redesign is the so-called teardrop hinge which describes teardrop hinge which describes how the scream curves to avoid creasing how the scream curves to avoid creasing it uses a zirconium-based liquid metal it uses a zirconium-based liquid metal that huawei says is twice as strong as that huawei says is twice as strong as the falcon wing hinge from previous the falcon wing hinge from previous models models the hinge motion feels steady and the hinge motion feels steady and doesn't allow you to set the phone to doesn't allow you to set the phone to any angle there's closed any angle there's closed open and there's also this somewhere in open and there's also this somewhere in between between as for the crease well i didn't really as for the crease well i didn't really see one most of the time at least when i see one most of the time at least when i was looking at the device was looking at the device head on but when peering over from the head on but when peering over from the right or left of the device from a wider right or left of the device from a wider angle angle solely for the purpose of spotting the solely for the purpose of spotting the crease i didn't see it crease i didn't see it but is it feelable kind of although it's but is it feelable kind of although it's still a still a smooth screen it's not as smooth as say smooth screen it's not as smooth as say regular glass there's a bit of an indent regular glass there's a bit of an indent but but it really didn't bother me at all it really didn't bother me at all in fact one of my favorite things to use in fact one of my favorite things to use this phone for was multi-tasking this phone for was multi-tasking the 8-inch inner screen provided ample the 8-inch inner screen provided ample space to do different tasks space to do different tasks one thing i almost forgot to mention one thing i almost forgot to mention though is that the inner screen does though is that the inner screen does lack a camera i mean it is notchless so lack a camera i mean it is notchless so that means you can't use the inner that means you can't use the inner screen for video calls and you have to screen for video calls and you have to use the smaller front screen use the smaller front screen now using a phone with two displays has now using a phone with two displays has obvious trade-offs obvious trade-offs the mate x2 is thick and heavy weighing the mate x2 is thick and heavy weighing 295 grams and measuring 14.7 millimeters 295 grams and measuring 14.7 millimeters at its thickest point when folded at its thickest point when folded so the phone can't comfortably be used so the phone can't comfortably be used one-handed one-handed but it's not as heavy as you might think but it's not as heavy as you might think huawei found a crafty workaround to help huawei found a crafty workaround to help reduce the hefty feeling of the phone by reduce the hefty feeling of the phone by employing a wedge-shaped design kind of employing a wedge-shaped design kind of like a door stopper like a door stopper the mate x2 is thickest near the camera the mate x2 is thickest near the camera module then gradually slims down to four module then gradually slims down to four millimeters on the other side millimeters on the other side that makes it easier to hold the phone that makes it easier to hold the phone one-handed not that you would much one-handed not that you would much and it pushes the center of gravity to and it pushes the center of gravity to the thicker side of the phone the thicker side of the phone now beyond offering a smooth folding now beyond offering a smooth folding phone experience huawei has made sure to phone experience huawei has made sure to stack the mate x2 stack the mate x2 with some hard hitting features there's with some hard hitting features there's also a powerful also a powerful processor in the form of the kieran 9000 processor in the form of the kieran 9000 and as always a

functional wired headphones and a very functional leather-like case which has a kickstand leather-like case which has a kickstand for propping up the phone for propping up the phone as you can probably tell i'm pretty as you can probably tell i'm pretty impressed with the mate x2 impressed with the mate x2 now beyond offering that smooth folding now beyond offering that smooth folding phone experience phone experience wahhway made sure to stack it with some wahhway made sure to stack it with some of those excellent features i just spoke of those excellent features i just spoke about about admittedly the mate x2 has some obvious admittedly the mate x2 has some obvious drawbacks drawbacks it's a pretty big phone for starters so it's a pretty big phone for starters so not the most portable not the most portable that sky high price i mentioned puts it that sky high price i mentioned puts it out of range for many people out of range for many people and it only got a china launch though i and it only got a china launch though i do suspect huawei will make the next do suspect huawei will make the next generation version generation version available internationally and due to available internationally and due to those crippling us those crippling us sanctions google apps like gmail and sanctions google apps like gmail and google maps do not run google maps do not run on the mate x2 though i was able to on the mate x2 though i was able to access gmail for instance access gmail for instance on the web browser now even with those on the web browser now even with those imperfections i still imperfections i still do think the mate x2 is a phone that do think the mate x2 is a phone that deserves and demands your attention deserves and demands your attention even if you can't or don't buy it like i even if you can't or don't buy it like i said earlier said earlier it demonstrates the potential of it demonstrates the potential of foldable phones and where it might

appreciate that for more we would really appreciate that and thanks for watching and i'll catch and thanks for watching and i'll catch you in the next one you in the next one welcome to Wally's just announced 2020 foldable smartphone the meat excess and actually got the chance to spend a full day alone with it so I'm gonna tell you everything you need to know and what actually happened so I started the day at 11 a.m. with a hundred percent battery and from this point I was allowed to do whatever I wanted with the phone as long as I was back by night because well it was still highly confidential so I decided to take it to three London locations each so I could test a different feature the traffic light tree the Natural History Museum and finally a place called God's own junkyard which was just spectacular but I'll get to this for starters as we were heading to location one a few things became very clear about the mate access this is a smartphone first foldable second and that's a good thing compared to say Samsung's Galaxy fold where when you're not actively using the main insight display you kind of inhibited you're stuck on this tiny little screen on the front while Waze design means that even when it's folded up it's still pretty much just a normal looking modern flagship phone albeit a chunky one at 11 millimeters thick the display on it is good it's an 8 inch 24 80 by 2200 OLED panel and compared to last year's mate X one of the more obvious changes is how it opens you're still pressing a release catch on the back but you'll notice straight away that the display kind of flies out because it's got a more powerful spring-loaded mechanism and even more importantly there are now over 150 parts in the hinge alone to make it feel firmer and snap together more convincingly for both the closing and the opening anyways time to jump into the London Underground but of course the reviewing never stops there is still a crease in the display where the fold is and how obvious it is depends massively on the lighting around you but I would say most the time it's less noticeable then for its foldable peers but the more impressive feat though is just how razor thin it is when you unfold it the body is just five point four millimeters thick that's the equivalent of taking a really slim smartphone and chopping an extra thirty percent off it Huawei has also added these little oval shaped pieces at the pivot points to stop any dirt getting under the screen now while on the rail it was also a pretty good chance to start testing the cameras at earth main camera has a 14 megapixel sensor which actually has no optical image stabilization but uses the company's most advanced AI stabilization now I'm not gonna lie to you having both would be better but at the same time the AI alone can handle situations like this the software is essentially an open-source version of Android 10 paired with hallways Mui 10 so it's the same general look the same customization and the same dark mode that you're used to it took a while but we eventually reached location number one the traffic light tree and I don't really know what to tell you there is no reason an abomination like this should exist but I'm kind of glad it does because it's a great opportunity to play around with what I think is one of the coolest features of the phone before that though it's worth pointing out that as well as the main 40 megapixel camera the phone has both an ultra-wide and a three times optical zoom lens so that just means you can go from being really far from your subject to appearing rather close and as an example this shot was taken with six times magnification this in itself isn't anything new though but the very nature of this being a foldable phone lets you do something that is tapping on this icon at the corner turns on mirror mode so that when you take a photo of someone they can at the same time that see how they look sort out that hair potentially position themselves the way they would want to be positioned when I describe it it sounds obvious and simple but in my opinion that solves one of the biggest pain points of asking someone else to take a photo of you because most of the time they don't know how you want it add to that the I'm a massive fan of efficiency so I love the fact that instead of having one set of cameras for the front of your phone and another set of cameras for the back you can just flip the phone around and use its main rear camera to take selfies the obvious upside is that these selfies are the same quality then as images from the rear camera even in portrait mode which is actually aided by the fourth camera which is this little 3d depth sensor at the bottom anyways time to head to location number two as curious as I was about how an ornament like this in the middle of a very real roundabout is anything but a serious hazard if by the way you're enjoying this video asad to the mister who's the boss channel would be incredible now was a pretty good time to register my fingerprint and see how that works unfold ball because bear mind the trade-off of having cameras on the back of your phone only means that there's no face unlocking it works well though the fingerprint scanner is actually bundled in with the power button so by the time you've pressed the power button to turn your screen on it's already checked for your fingerprint and you're in nothing in London is as close as it seems so for a quick pit stop on the way we head up of coffee shop using it as a base camp to try a few more things I've been meaning to if it starters though you might have noticed already by how light reflects on this front display that it's actually not entirely flat it's a plastic display with actually more layers than ever for even better shatter resistance but that just means that it's ever so slightly domed you do stop noticing it after a bit though and now is also a good time to mention that the chipset in the phone is the Kirin 995 G which has two implications most obviously well of 5g you might know that we can broadly split 5g waves into two categories you've got the ultra-high speed mm waves with only a narrow range and medium speed sub six waves which aren't as quick but can travel much further well this Kirin chip supports sub six only so I tried downloading a game on 5g it didn't have that kind of snappy instantaneousness of mm wave but it was still fast and I guess more importantly the 5g worked in almost every area of London we visited which I was not expecting the other side to this caring chip is the fact that it's a real solid performer it's around at 25% speed bump from the company's last gen and that means that games fly plus something I'm not used to on a fault of all is having app adaptability the idea that when you open your display your content will adjust to fill the entire 8 inch panel with some apps this is an amazing feature with others you might lose some important info but just the fact that you don't need to restart the app from scratch is in itself an improvement from what I'm used to off we went again and as we neared the Natural History Museum we found well ok it's just a road really but I liked it and it kind of shows the contrast between the older London architecture and the newer buildings I already can't stress enough how much we benefit to have your rear cameras on your face like what I said you've got the same 4k quality video at the same stabilization as would have on your normal primary camera on your face this is like cinematic quality vlog footage so right now we're off to see the Natural History Museum and okay I'm quite excited to see some dinosaurs one quick London Underground trip I'm totally ready for the babies start handing out loyalty cards with this and 20 minutes of steering a suitcase through crowds of people trying not to knock kids over we arrived and actually at this point something I'd forgotten to show you earlier is that the other cool thing about having just one set of cameras is that even on the front you can use your ultra wide lens for let's say group selfies you can even use the zoom camera if you're really confident about the quality of your skin alright so we have just arrived at the Natural History Museum take a look at this building is literally it is so immense that I think before I even realize what I was doing my hands were already out taking a photo and it's almost like this building was built to take a patent around myself not a fan of blowing my own trumpet but pretty happy with how this turned out and it seems like I wasn't the only one inside we went and I forgotten just how stunning the place is the scale of this building and the fossils inside of it is just colossal and so you might have guessed it was time to find a high point for an ultra-wide camera shots on the way though a couple more things to point out about the phone the mate excess has a zero gap design ie when it's folded up the screen is at a complete 180 degree angle and you can't see in between the other thing that I thought was really interesting is that the only way we always managed to make the main body so slim is that it pretty much just contains the battery almost every other actual smartphone component is fitted into this narrow bar on the side so that battery is 4,500 milliamp hours in total split between two cells that sit on either side of the fold and in terms of the battery life that gives you well that's part of what we're figuring out today but so far at least we're on about 65% battery after three and a half hours of heavy usage now because of how Huawei is crammed literally everything the cameras the chipset the antenna into this little block on the side it needs better cooling so compared to last gen they're now using a triple cooling system a flexible graphite layer that spans both sides to keep the batteries call and a vapor chamber inside the main block and finally before we leave here's that ultra wide shot that come to think of it we actually came for oh yeah and of course there's one thing you can't leave a museum without visiting yeah it's the gift shop [Music] and we were off to our third final and hopefully most impressive location and by this point I'd become quite familiar with the phone especially how intuitive the multitasking is you open one app in this case let's say the Sun newspaper you then swipe in from the side to get a multitasking bar and whatever you drag from there immediately becomes a second window that's pretty normal smartphone multitasking but the coolest part is that you can get a third app involved that'll just by default become a floating window on top of the two apps you're already running I wouldn't hesitate to call this the best Android multitasking experience out there and even if you don't want to use the big screen for doing lots of things at once you can still just scale single applications and they generally work well final destination it's a place God's own junkyard and I've never been I just saw some Google Image results of it and I was like that is the perfect place to test the phone's low-light capabilities because in theory that is something that we always good at it turns out that this location I've been planning to visit was not particularly close so far out that it only just classes as being in London and see the closer we came to it the dodgy are the area got oh yeah and it was incredibly windy by some miracle though we found it I was giggling like a school child when I saw the sign confirmation that we hadn't just traveled for an hour and risked our lives to hang out in an empty industrial estate it describes itself as heavenly junk in a hell of a location and I can vouch for the accuracy of that description we headed inside and it was neon paradise this whole place is so Erie's there's like it's in the middle of nowhere there's like nobody here oh we had some amazing footage and that we did literally anywhere you turn there is a new photo to capture so I use the phone's night mode which in this lighting takes 5 seconds per shot to draw out as much detail as possible and these are the results completely unedited I would have taken more but it turns out someone had privately hired the location and to put it nicely they told us to pay up or find the exit anyways time to head back I'd got most of what I wanted anyways so we parked up in a coffee shop just to take my sim card out and transfer footage to my laptop before handing the phone back to hallway while I was out there some final observations when unfolded the mate excess functions largely as a full-size tablet you get tabbed browsing like you would on a laptop and decent quality audio thanks to it using both the bottom firing speaker and an earpiece on the front I would say though well the main 8 inch display is fantastic for reading if you're just going to be watching a video you're probably better off with the smaller front display because the wide aspect ratio suits content better as well as your 5g SIM the phone also supports a Huawei nm card to expand storage and comes pre baked with 512 gigs out the box anyways as well as 8 gigabytes of RAM interesting to note that the battery in the end really pulled through I did burn the first 30% quite quickly in the early afternoon but as I spent less time recording videos in the second half of the day we made it quite easily they were still about 40% left as I finally handed it back at 6:30 p.m. after seven and a half hours of usage was actually not bad at all if you enjoyed this video there is a whole playlist of day in the lives on my channel so I'll leave that linked somewhere from here and a sub would be amazing stuff like this takes an absolute age to put together but I think is worth it let me know if you do - my name is Aaron that this is mr. who's the boss I'll catch you in it [Music] [Music] okay so last month one of you the viewer emailed me saying oh i saw your video where you're talking about how you've never seen the huawei mate x like outside of a demo area but i have i own one do you want me to like send one to you maybe you can make a video about it so first of all very generous offer and we really appreciated it but turns out it was just a little bit risky with international shipping and then just with the state of the world right now trying to insure it because it was his personal phone and we definitely wanted to get it back to him but it wasn't fully guaranteed so instead we just went down the rabbit hole of trying to buy one just seeing if i could get my hands on one here once and for all so as it turns out you could probably guess it's really hard to get one here in the u.s they don't want it they can't ship here but then uh dbrand steps in and they're like yeah we can we can secure one and if i've learned one thing over the years it's to never doubt dbrand's ability to secure really hard to get things this is the same company that secured 12 ps5s and 12 xbox series x's at the same time in the height of their demand still not sure how they pull that off so yeah they got a mate x so here we have it huawei mate xs in collaboration with leica apparently so the funny part about the timing of just getting my hands on it now is we have rumors saying the successor is coming really soon and i'll address that in a little bit but i just wanted to get this phone for myself and actually see what it's about so right at the top is the phone with the plastic with a ton of warnings on it but that comes right off and this is the first time i'm holding the phone and wow it's a lot thinner than i expected i'll get to that in a second behind the phone is another card with a printed set of the same warnings the same precautions then underneath is the rest of the hardware that actually comes with this phone you get your paperwork and a bumper case that i'll show you you get a usbc to usbc cable then you also get your power adapter for fast charging and you get your usbc wired earbuds okay so i wanted to get my hands on this phone because like i said in my royal flex pi 2 video i've literally never seen this phone before and now that i'm holding it and using it well there's a lot of thoughts and observations that go straight to the top so when it's closed it looks like a normal phone just a big phone 6.6 inch diagonal phone but you know you can see the fingerprint reader doubles as a power button on the right hand side you've got your volume rocker the screen goes pretty close to the edges but then of course there's a couple obvious quirks so you can see the fold of course and you can also see the usb-c port is all the way over to the right-hand side and two it's very smooth feeling because of course the display is what's wrapping around on the sides and they've polished and smoothed the right side to sort of look just like the screen wrapping around the left side but when you look at it you can kind of tell the bezel on the right is just a little thicker than their cutoff of the display on the left kind of reminds me of the first ever galaxy note edge so you can use it closed just like a normal phone but that's not why you get this phone right you got to be opening it up all the time to get your money's worth so to open this phone up you flip it over and there's a red button and you press that button and the back part of the display is spring loaded and it flips out halfway open and then it's up to you to push it all the rest of the way open and sort of snaps into place when it's flat and then you've got your full size eight inch 2480 by 2200 oled canvas for all the productivity and big screen tasks in the world okay so a couple of thoughts so first of all i was immediately pretty struck by how thin this is it's 5.5 millimeters thick at the thin part and that of course means when you fold it over that's 11 millimeters that's not much thicker than a normal smartphone these days but the reason this whole thing is able to be so thin is mainly because these wings of the phone as i'll call them are basically just screen and battery so the total combined battery is 4 500 milliamp hours with some battery in each side but pretty much all the rest of the components of this phone are packed into this column over here that low key kind of acts as a grip when you start to get used to holding it but that's why the usbc port is over here that's where the kirin 990 processor and eight gigs of ram and half a terabyte of storage are and that's of course where all the cameras are there's no camera cutouts for a selfie camera or anything like that all of the cameras live over here in this column and there's four of them there's a 40 megapixel primary camera an ultra wide a 3x telephoto zoom and a depth sensor and this is a review of these of course this is just my impressions but i do like the idea that in a folding phone you can take advantage of the main cameras for everything including selfie stuff so with the mate xs you hit the button to switch to a selfie and then you literally flip the phone around and you're using those huge high quality main cameras to take selfies so you can use the ultrawide or even the zoom if you're into that and then also because this is screen on the back it's off most of the time but if you want to hit this button and turn the back screen on now you can show people as you're taking a photo of them what that photo's going to look like so yeah there you are so now with the viewfinder mirrored on the back you can imagine being able to hand the phone to someone and like direct them exactly how to take the photo based on what you see so i feel like we all kind of know huawei's software experience here in the us is a bit nuked because they don't have a relationship with the us anymore and so even if you are able to get the phone here there's no google play services it's not ideal but there are some pretty nice software features in here where you get control over app scaling so some apps get column support on the big screen so there's a lot of good stuff but and this is the other side of the coin there's downsides too and you'll probably saw these coming so the crease there's no getting around it there's still a crease on folding phones and it can kind of catch your eye sometimes but i feel like this is as good as it gets with the current tech when you're actually looking at the contents of what's on the screen you really don't notice the crease it's just when you run your fingers straight over it or it catches a light a certain way then you do notice it but speaking of catching the light a certain way the built-in screen protector that's on this phone which is super important for protecting the super soft flexible oled doesn't uniformly go up to the edges so there's notches and cutouts everywhere and it caught my eye all the time so i'm not going to pull it off because i know better i know better than that but the dust collecting on these uneven edges and just the way the light hits it you can't tell me that wouldn't eventually bother you a little bit but hey better to have a screen protector than not because unfortunately i've placed this phone down like a normal phone a few too many times and i've ended up with some scratches on the back plastic because well when you put it down it literally touches the ground so if you put it on a desk that plastic is touching a desk if there's any sort of grit or any particles or materials at all on that surface that's going up straight against the plastic and most phones are cool with that of course but this plastic screen protector is like scratches at a level one with deeper grooves at a level breathing too hard so i'm not shocked that it's already starting to see some marks but of course the whole point is you get the marks in the screen protector and you're not damaging the screen basically the bumper case that comes with this phone is like the best possible solution because then it sort of raises it up off of whatever surface you put it down on so if you're super never want to get any sort of scratches on it put the bumper case on it's a little less elegant but then you don't get scratches and then the hinge here on the xs is slightly improved from the x so you can see there's these dust caps now and the metal back to the hinge to keep it almost completely gapless when it's folding but of course it's still not going to be water or dust resistant or anything they're just doing the best they can so at the end of the day on one hand this feels like the most advanced sexiest folding phone i've ever seen it's it's pretty stunning hardware but on the other hand like i was saying in the flexpi video i'll link it below it's just it's just not quite technically ready to be doing this outside fold thing so i'm really curious about the next version because like i said word on the street is the huawei mate x2 or whatever this next version is called is supposedly coming out within the next month or so and headlines suggest it's going to be switching to the inside folding design like the galaxy fold which would make a lot of sense given the current state of the tech you know there's a couple other things i'd like to see i'd like to see a 120 hertz display i like to see ho maybe a slightly bigger battery i know they want to keep it all thin and sexy like this but yeah i'm very curious now about how folding stuff goes forward seeing how this ended up you know do we go straight to folding on the inside and then come back to the outside fold when the folding screen tech is better we'll see let me know what your thoughts are below if you think we should still do the outside fold stuff or not that's pretty much it i'm glad i finally got my hands on the stone and uh now i know that's been it thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace [Music] hey what's up ross's fonte here i hope everybody's safe for nothing and in today's video i'm going to show you the differences between the harmony os 2 and emo i 11 but before we started please subscribe to my channel if you haven't already for more content like this thank you so much and now let's go on the left we have the huawei mate x2 with the new operation system harmony os2 and on the right is a p40 pro plus with android 10 and my 11 so let's start with the core application so the phone up [Music] you have your contacts and favorites as well on the emoy 11 [Music] now messages we have here the mailbox on the imoi 11 we have the bubble and the plus symbol now let's uh try camera and it's a it's the same let's try more so the camera application is pretty similar i can see one difference here the pen the edit option yeah some differences here go back let's try video almost the same brothers almost the same you have your aperture here so the camera application is pretty similar let's try the video here next and i agree of course use now so this is the video application what about music right here i agree so this is the music application [Music] what's next with teams right here later this app is different as you can see categories on both then we have the mi section and it's very different on my 11 versus compared to uh harmony os2 so i go back and let's try more remember [Music] sensor no later deny so this is the member center application but the basics clock [Music] almost the same the icons are different we have the rounded tile here world clock stop watch and timer of course it's almost the same brothers and let's uh one more let's try one more the calendar right here it's almost the same we have the bigger font here of course you can do this so let's go back and dive in into the settings right here brothers so again i don't accept uh expect uh a a big difference between the harmony os 2 and the my 11 so let's go let's scroll down about phone harmony os moi go back here we have uh on the harmony we have the hms core section which isn't available on the email eleven system and update software update system navigation let's open system navigation and it's uh practically the same again reset we have on the harmony we have the function of guard which protects the device by blocking the installation of apps which aren't in the gallery so and accessibility and tips so pretty the same users and accounts same accessibility features brothers accessibility under harmony os the functions are more separated so it's uh easy to navigate uh within the uh settings application here it's uh only the white uh background and uh we have the uh the tiles here pretty rounded nice so what next we have the huawei assistant here let's tap on it the same almost the same so let's uh let's go here home screen into a wallpaper let's do the same brothers we have on the imo 11 we have a lock screen signature hey hi so and on the harmony os we have the home screen settings and uh home screen settings but uh on the harmony we don't have the home screen style so uh we have uh on the harmony only the standard we don't have the rubber on the harmony os uh let's try display and brightness on both devices again matrix 2 with harmony os and uh e40 pro plus with imo 11 and android 10 brothers uh it's uh it's it's it's nicer i think it's nicer on the harmony os i think looks cleaner and more separated and polished but in general i think it's the same as the emi 11. we have because it's affordable for we have the split speed view here and upscaling uh but it's the same i comfort uh i come for this year so it's in uh the view mode now we have the text and display display size pretty good on the harmony what about sound and vibration brothers i think the big differences will be here and of course it is much nicer on the harmony os but of course so let's try to change the ringtone and as you can see it's a basically the it's the same it's the same so if you uh if you wanna if you if you wanna switch uh from the email 11 and android uh to a new huawei phone with harmony you you won't be lost because it's uh practically the same so go back let's write notifications we have here and of course we have the notifications menu here app icon badges hide notification content of course uh the notifications manage all we have here and uh we have the manager all here but we can of course most recent most frequent a to z and uh we don't have on the imoi 11 so go back let's try battery for battery and it's a it's almost the same brothers almost the same and let's try one more storage we have it here the graph the wrong that uh uh graphic uh interface very nice and the clean up uh in the center of the screen but uh the cleanup button we have at the bottom with the 11 but basically the same again and of course and okay let's try biometrics and password almost the same but now let's try brothers uh multitasking right here upon it i think it's the same what about animations yeah it's basically the same but uh on the in my album we have more room that uh the tiles the applications in the background so we have the bin icon here i tap on it and the animation is the same what about notification panel control panel on the imo 11 sorry brothers yeah sorry pull down the notification panel and we have here the shortcuts and of course here the notifications on the harmony os there is a big difference i have to pull down the notification bar on the right upper right corner and we we have here the new control panel it reminds me ios and if i pull down on the left we have uh the notification so huawei did separate the notifications from other features from other functions uh from control panel and we have the notifications and uh uh the control panel which shortcuts the functions so separated with with harmony os as you can see so and that's uh basically it brothers uh this is the b40 pro plus uh email havana this is harmony os2 and everything looks very similar almost the same but on the harmony i think it's a much nicer it's a bit nicer and cleaner i better like the harmony os operation system i think huawei did a very good job so i do hope you ended up enjoying the video brothers don't forget to

i love you ciao [Applause] [Applause] you Oh! Mom this bridge is so narrow. I am very scared. Sister, be careful. Mr. Bhushan, this house is too far. Yes, it is, but in your budget it ... ...is difficult to
get a house in the city. Ah! The bridge is so narrow.
The door won't open. Do one thing, drive slowly
to the other side of the bridge. Then we will see what to do. And the bungalow is in front of us. Madam, here is your house. Tramp! Please, come. Hey! Wow! Come. - Tramp.. Tramp. Please come, Madam. Shall we live here from today, Sasha? Hey! Don't be stupid.
Call me Didi (sister). And yes, this is our new house. Why don't we live in our old house? Because we sold that house. Wonder! The lock is not opening.. ..but yesterday when
I came to keep the baggage.. ..I had opened the lock with this key. Is it so? I will search for another
way to get inside from behind. Sasha, take care of her. I am just coming. Ok.
Tramp. Hey! The door has opened! Sorry Madam, the safety lock was stuck.. ..so the lock was
not opening from outside. It doesn't matter.
- Wow! The house is so wonderful. Do you like it? No, I don't like it. By the way, what do you like, duffer? Mom, our room will be upstairs.
Shall we see it? Yes, go and see.
Be careful on the stairs. - Come, soon. All the materials are properly arranged.
Please, check Madam. Mom! No, my child, itís nothing. Now go to sleep. See, your doll is here, also. Sasaha, you also go to bed. Mom, only five minutes. I will finish this beautiful drawing
and then I will sleep. - Good night. Good night, Mom. Sweet dreams. Who has burned this place, Sasha? Sasha! Right, Sasha?
Can you call me, big sister? And the ghost had burned this place!
The ghost! Which ghost? Casper ghost or Dracula ghost? You are great. What happened, Vicky? Sister, the villagers are saying that
yesterday a thunderbolt had fallen here. They thought that it is an unlucky omen.. ..so, they are observing rituals. Sasah, Nisha, come on.
It is late for school. Ok. Come on, Tramp. Tramp, come on.. Tramp. Tramp, come on. Tramp. Tramp, come inside. Yes? Take this, my child. But for what? It will be of use to you.
It is for you only. But, I can't pay you for it, right now. My child. - I can pay when it gets sold. It is not for sell.
It will be of use to you. It is for you only. Keep it. Listen! Let's check out there. - Ok. Can you show me this? So beautiful!
- Wow! How much for this?
- Five hundred. Take this. Thank you. 
- Thank you. It is beautiful. Where did she go?! Listen. Listen. Hello. Sanjana, we didn't find any dead
body where you told us to look for it. We didn't find any woman's dead body. Sir, I saw her with my own eyes. She was sitting on the bench and
as soon as I touched her, she fell down. But Madam, not only the bench.. ..but we also searched
the entire surrounding area. I didn't see anything. I can't understand this. Even then, if you get any
information about that lady.. ..then please contact us.. Ok?
- Ok. Yo.. Yo.. Fire .. Fire.. Fire.
- Sasha, my child. Go to bed. No mom, I do not want to sleep.
I want to play. Fire! Fire! Don't play games. Go to bed, at once. Nisha, you also.
- Okay. - Okay. Fire.. Fire.. Fire.. Fire. Good night, Mom.
- Good night. Sister.. Sister, look all the windows
and doors of our house are open. But how? I don't know. Perhaps a thief has entered our house. Where are the kids? They are in their bedroom. Nisha, get up..
get up, Nisha. - Sasha.. get up. I want to sleep. Sasha, here is a thief in our house. Sister, we will do one thing. We will switch on all the
lights and make a big noise. Either the thief will run away,
or we will catch him. Thief.. Thief.. Thief.. Thief. - Come out! Thief.. Thief.. Thief.. Thief. - Come out! Thief.. Thief.. Thief.. Thief. - Come out! Come here. Thief.. Thief.. Thief.. Come out. - Thief! Sasha! Nisha! There is no one.
- Search that side. Thief.. Thief.. mom. Thief.. Thief.. - Come out. Where are you thief, I will kill you. Mom, perhaps he would
be on the other side. He is not there, either. No one there? Vicky, these windows and doors! Ok, let's go inside. Tramp, come inside. - Come on. Come on, Tramp. - Come on. Come on, Tramp.. Tramp.. Tramp. Oh! Who burnt this fire? Nobody is here! Tramp!.. Tramp! Tramp. Where did he go? Tramp. Tramp. Tramp. Tramp. Tramp. Tramp. Tramp. Tra... Come on, Tramp. Tramp, come on. Come on, Tramp. Tramp. What are you saying, Vicky?
Iím also worried about him. Don't know where heís gone? Sister, I am telling the truth. When I went to give him
his meal he was not in his place. Then I went behind our house searching
for him, then I saw him digging the soil. Like he wanted to bring
out something from there. He was behaving like abnormal. At first, I called him,
but he didn't recognize my voice.. ..and when I went ahead to hold his belt..
he attacked me. I was frightened by his attack, Sister. Vicky, how can you be afraid of Tramp? You took care of him from his childhood. You fed him with your own hands. Don't know why he behaved like that.
I don't understand. Uncle, what happened to our Tramp? Please, Nisha, Tramp ran away. Since morning he didn't have anything. And I am sure Mom,
Tramp is definitely afraid of something. No, Tramp isn't afraid of anybody, Sasha. Please Nisha, how many times
have I told you to call me Sister. Uncle Vicky, I want Tramp. Yes, my child. Mom, we will do one thing,
we will go out to search for Tramp. And I am sure that when we call him,
he definitely will come to us. My child, Tramp will come
in the night and if he won't, then.. ..we will search for him in the morning. Now hurry up,
your home work has yet to be done.. ..and then you have to sleep, too.
- Ok Mom. Tramp. Tramp. Tramp. Tramp. Tramp. Tramp. Tramp. What? Money! Are you asking money from me? From where should I give you money?
From where? Madam, you are very lucky
that you got such a nice bungalow. In your budget,
you can't get any bungalow in this area. Don't know since when it was locked.. ..and through many difficulties.. I found it's owners who live
abroad and I didn't take my brokerage. And you are asking for money. I don't know anything.
Mr. Bhushan, but you should help me. I don't want to live in that house. Ok, if you have decided .. ...that you don't want to live there then
something will have to be done. I will do one thing. I will seek any customer for your bungalow
and find another bungalow for you. Pray to God that both
will be found together. If both aren't found together,
then you must live there. It is a helpless situation. ëWhat are you thinking about, Sanjana?í 'I am not under your control.' 'I am asking you for the last time,
are you coming with me, or not?' 'Of course,
I want to come with you, Vijay.' 'But, you know Papa's condition.í ëAnything could happen to him,
at any time.' ëHow can we go and leave
him in this condition?í ëWeíll take him with us.í ëAre you gone mad?
Will I take that old and cunning man?í ëNever. If it was in my hands,
I would have thrown him out long ago.í ëHe must die by writhing for the sin,
which he committed.í ëVijay, he got the
punishment for his sins.í ëThat means you won't come and leave him? And I can't take him with me.í ëThen it is Ok, live here.
Do his service. Suffer with him.í ëAfter today,
there is no relation between you and me.í ëAfter today I won't see your face.í ëAnd don't you love your children?í ëThey are yours and keep them wih you.í ëAnd use their services
for your father, too.í What happened, Sanjana?
You seem distracted. Are you recalling Vijay in this new house? No, not at all. But your face says something else. I know, you won't tell me anything. I know you from childhood.
You hide everything in your heart. Doesn't tell anyone. Listen Sanjana, whenever
you need something then let me know. Yes, thanks, Pooja. I must leave. I have to pick up the kids.. ..and Vicky will be
waiting for me at the shop. Ok, bye. 
- Take care.. Bye. Sister, Tramp.
- Oh! He came! Mom, Tramp! Tramp. Tramp. Mom, see Tramp. One minute, stop, Vicky.
- Tramp. Tramp. Tramp. Tramp.
- Mom, tramp is smelling. Sasha! - Mom.. Mom. Sasha, everything is fine. Everything will be fine.- Mom Vicky. Vicky. Vicky.
- Sister! Sister, what happened? Vicky, someone is in the house. Where? - Don't know. Find him.
- I will check. Vicky, please call the police, please. I will search for him. Mom, what happened Mom? Mom! Mom!
- What happened, Mom? Mom.. 
- What happened? Sister, nobody is there. No one is in the house. No one is out sister. What happened, Mom? Why are you crying? Sister. - Yes? I am sleeping in the hall outside.
Keep the door open. Just call me if you need me. - Ok. Good night. - Good night. Vicky. Vicky. Vicky. Vicky, get up. Someone is here. Sister, what happened? - Children. Sister what happened? Sasha, Nisha, get up. You wake her up. Mom. - Let's go, kids. Mom! - We must leave from here. Let's go. Hurry up. Hurry up.
Open the door. Open the door. Let's go. 
- Come on. Come on. Where is the key?
- It is inside. I will bring it. I will bring it,
you take care of the kids. Key. Key. Key! Mom. - Let's go. - Sister. Mom. Vicky, do you hear any thing? What? Sanjana. - Yes. Take these blankets for the kids. Thank you, so much. Have you gone mad for thanking me? Iíll bring one for you. Sister.. Sister,
I don't understand what is going on? Vicky, even I am unable to understand. Sister, are you Ok? Yes. Go to bed. Good night.
- Good night. Let's go out and talk.
- Yes. Sanjana, now tell me what is the matter? What happened that you had
to leave your house at midnight? Tell me what's wrong? Tell me, Sanjana, please. I was raped, Pooja. I was raped. Why don't you go to the police station? What can I say there,
that I didn't see the rapist? And  when this accident occurred.. ..at that time,
all the windows and doors were shut.. ..and there was no strange
person in the house? You know Pooja,
that policeman inquires very deeply. They think that I am mad. But it happened to me,
Pooja, this is the truth. Sanjana, why don't you go to any doctor. Maybe there is an internal injury and .. ..it will become serious, later on. To which doctor will I go? Pooja, will you stay there all day? Coming. Go to a doctor who
will be secretive about.. ..all these things and reports. You know, Sanjana,
here a little thing gets broadcasted soon. I know a doctor, Aasif Ali
in Wilindor Hospital he is very nice.  Should I talk with him?
- Pooja! Pooja, where is my breakfast?
What are you doing there? Come up. - Coming, coming..
just bringing it. Did you ask your friend for
how many days she will stay here? She is very much disturbed. That's why she came to disturb us. Try to understand. Yes, you are the only
intellectual person in this world. Listen carefully,
if her house is  irritating her.. ..then there is no
Scarcity of hotels here. You made this house into an orphanage. Now, enough. We can face any difficulty
in our life by following.. ..Sage Buddha's teaching
of knowledge and religion. And we can brighten our life with it. Sage Buddha said that
whenever we do any work.. ..with a pure heart, then happiness
follows us like our shadow.. ..which doesn't leave
us throughout our whole life. Mom.
- Yes, my child. Mom.
- Yes, my child. Mom. How have all these things happened. I don't know, my child. Did you hear? Yes, Mom. Sister, I know from
where this noise is coming. I know it. - Vicky, where are you going? Mom.
- Vicky, no. Uncle.
- Vicky, no. Vicky, don't go there.. Vicky.
- Uncle.. Uncle.
- Vicky, stop. Sister, don't stop me. Vicky, don't go. Sister, I know from
where this noise is coming. You donít go. - Sister, let go of me! Uncle.. Uncle.
- Vicky.. Vicky. Uncle, where are you going? Uncle Vicky. Uncle Vicky. Uncle Vicky. Vicky. Sister, see this.
When it moves, the noise is heard. But Vicky, who moved it? Sister, are you sleeping in the hall? Yes, I feel suffocated
in the bedroom. - Ok. Uncle Vicky, whatever may happen,
you will sleep with us. Ok. - Come! Come! Oh, Pooja! What a pleasant surprise.
Don't talk to me. I am very angry with you. Without informing me,
you came here with the kids. Pooja, that... Are you sleeping here? On the sofa? - Yes. Then it is Ok,
I will sleep in your bedroom. Then I will also sleep inside. Tell me one thing, Sanjana? - Yes. Why did you come here
without feeding the kids? Pooja, I don't want to
create problems between you and.. ..your husband because of me. Listen friend,
my husband came into my life afterwards.. ..but we are friends
since we were three years old. Do you remember that our
Mothers made two ponytails for us.. ..and sent us to school
where the other kids said.. ..here come the cats with the tails. We are not twins but we
are like twins and can't be apart. Perhaps you forget all these things,
but I don't. Ok, sorry. I told my husband that if my friend
can't stay here then I will go to her. Let's leave him alone.
Iím coming after changing. - Ok. Sanjana, go to bed. It's very late. - Yes. Iím feeling very sleepy. Come. Good night. How can the car be here? Good morning, Mom. - Hi. Good morning, mom. Pooja, youíre sure you
want to drop the kids to school. Of course friend, go and open your shop. It is close from two days. I will drop kids while going home,
don't worry. Ok, thanks.. Bye. Bye, Mom. Bye, sister.. Sister.
- Bye. Hello, Sanjana,
I am doctor Aasif Ali. - Hello. Are you feeling cold?
Should I start the heater? No, I am Ok. Ok, yes. Your reports are normal.
Everything is normal. There is no internal injury,
no blood pressure and no sugar. Your profile is good.
You're a physically fit person. No, tell me how are you feeling now? Someone tried to kill me in my car? Who did this? I don't know. I can't see him. But he stepped on the accelerator
to the maximum and sabotaged the brakes. Did you feel this for first time? No, before this.. he raped me. He raped you! And you can't see him. Is he a ghost? No doctor, he is like the wind..
felt but unseen. Have you felt any pain? Of course, he injured me. He was brutal with me. He was disgusting. Where did all this happen? In my house. Who was there at the time? My two kids and after my
noise my brother came to my room. What did he see? Nothing. What did he think? I don't know. Sanjana, what do you think? I think that if he doesn't get me,
then he will kill me. On the first night I went
to my friend's house to sleep and.. ..on the second night,
my friend came to stay with me. - Okay. He didn't reach me, so in frustration
and anger he tried to kill me in my car. In frustration! Sanjana, for how many years
have you been married and.. ..what is your husband's business? We don't live together.
We were divorced four years ago. Four years! In between did you have any
physical intimacy? Any boy friend? What rubbish, doctor? How is this connected to my problem? I'm sorry, Ms. Sanjana, but it is related. The past is very important. Past is a special part of our life. To understand today,
it is necessary to understand the past. And the body has its needs. Whatever you are feeling
maybe it is related with your past. I must tell you frankly
that the problem maybe inside you. Because medical science
doesn't accept ghosts. What do you mean to say? That whatever is happening
with me is my imagination, isn't it? My fear and my pain are my imagination? And from the last four years I didn't
have sex that is why I am thinking it? Sanjana please, try to understand.
I am talking about one side. There is a term in psychology.
That is split personality. That means one person lives two lives. He thinks that whatever
he does with himself.. ..he thinks that someone
else is doing that. Tell me, are you a doctor,
or psychiatrist? I am a doctor and psychiatrist, too. Oh! That means Pooja
sent me to a psychiatrist. To know that I may have gone mad. But I am not mad, doctor. I have been raped doctor, rape. Do you understand? Sanjana, please listen to me. Coward. Mom, see this coward got afraid. - Mom. Didnít you sleep till now? Mom Iíll sleep after this coward does. What happened, my child?
Did you tell her any thing? No, I didnít. What happened, Nisha? Mom, please sleep with us tonight. It's ok, I will come after having bath
then we will sleep together - Yes. Ok, now lie down. Iíll be right back. Don't scare her. Ok, Mom. Sanjana, she is Dr. Mrs. Kapoor. - Hello! Let's do your check up. Come, doctor. Show your wounds. See this. Oh my God! And see this. And this. See doctor. Oh! It is terrible. Have you seen? - Yes. Any more? - Yes, I will show you. See this. Oh goodness! And see this. Oh! Ok, doctor you may go. Ok. Come. So? Are these wounds real? Of course they are. I know that you are injured. And I didnít harm myself. Sanjana, I don't doubt you at all. And I am not disagreeing that
you are suffering from something bad. But being a doctor I can't accept this
that some soul can do this.. No. So, what do you have
to say about these wounds? Do you think I am imagining them? No, you are not imagining,
these are wounds. But I told about split personality by
experiencing such cases. I read about it. In such cases people injure
themselves and other people.. ..in a specific mental condition. And they don't remember about it. They don't remember anything, really. That means..
Now you want to say that I injured myself. You're talking about injuring themselves.. ..Sanjana, people kill themselves. What is suicide?
It is a height to hurt ourselves. But people commit suicide. I knew that you would find
a way to justify your words.. ..that I am going mad
and my personality is split. Sanjana. Anyways, thank you very much. Sanjana, please listen to me. Sanjana, you are still here? My car has broken down
so I am waiting for auto or bus.. ..whichever I get first, then.. But I came here first with my car.
Come, I will drop you. Don't trouble yourself, I will.. It is not a matter of trouble.
I am going the same way. Please, come. Please, have a seat. I hope that my driving
didnít scare you because.. ..people who sit besides
me are afraid of my driving. I am afraid of this house, doctor. Can I see your house, Sanjana? Yes, please come. Let's go. Is accelerator okay? Yes sir, it is. Doctor, he is my brother. Hi Vicky. - Hi, sir. How are you? - Fine sir. Please, come. - Let's go. Wow! Your house is very beautiful. Is that why you bought this
house by selling your old house? No, that was better than this. Ok. Mom, finally you're here. - Yes. Mom, you very well knew that
we are going to bring chocolate cake.. ..then too you came late. It is not fair, Mom.
- Sorry.. we will cut it after some time. It is ok. - Go. Hello. Hi. - Go. Hi. - Hello baby. Come on Nisha, catch me. Lovely kids.. These are your daughters? Yes.. Will you have coffee? No, thanks. You were telling that
you own an antique shop. Since how long you're
interesting in antique? Not me, but my father
was interested in it. I was too young, when my father died. Then my Grandpa and Granny
got my mother remarried. My second father was fond of antiques And he established this shop. Ok. - But after Vicky's
birth he had less interest in it. Then.. is Vicky not your own brother? No.. He is more than an own real brother. I see.. Sanjana, how was the
behavior of your step-father with you? It was fair. Fair means not too good, wasn't it? Forget it, doctor. Sanjana, I am trying
to understand your problem. And it is possible only
when you talk to me frankly. Whatever you tell me will be a secret. Tell me, did your father beat you? No, he didn't beat me but..
often he used to touch me.. ..where a father never
touches his daughter. Oh! Did you tell your mother about it? No. - To anyone else? After marriage I told this to my husband. I see, perhaps this was
the reason for your break up. No, when we broke up, father was too old. Oh. - He had backbone cancer. At that time he needed support and.. ..my husband didnít want to live with him. But because of humanity
I didnít leave him alone to die. Yes, is that the reason
you left your husband? No, it was his decision to leave. Ok, Ok.. Do you miss
your husband sometimes? Never.. it is difficult
to compliance two kids alone. And the shop is not
doing well so I came here.. ..by selling the old house. Then too, I don't miss him at all. Sanjana, you are brave. Even then I need your help. Of course Sanjana, I will try my best. I am with you. - Thank you. Welcome. Ok, I must leave. - Let's go. How much time will it take? Only two minutes, it will start now. Hurry up, man. Ok, take care. Ok. Bye Vicky.
- Bye sir. See you. 
- Okay. Nisha, Yummy, yummy cake. I want cake. Cake.. Hey.. one minute. Yummy. Mummy!
- Vicky! Sister! Uncle! Vicky! Mummy!
- Vicky! Mummy! Vicky! Vicky! Yes Vicky, tell me how are you? Its paining doctor. I will tell Dr.
Verma, he will give you pain killers. Thank you. Come out.. Who are you? Come out.. Who are you? Who are you? Come out. Why did you break the
windows of the house, Sanjana? He tried to trap me. I don't know. I was sleeping.. ..then he tried to
touch me such a way that.. ..and I was feeling good but..
when suddenly I woke up then.. ..I felt very disgusting.. ..then I broke all the windows
and doors of my house, doctor. Sanjana, you should
get hospitalized right now. Why hospitalize? I am not sick, doctor. I am not telling that your are sick,
but I want to say that.. ..you should get hospitalized for one week
so that we can do your proper check up. When I am not sick why are
you eager to make me patient, doctor? Oh my God! Sanjana,
at least think about your daughters. Nothing will happen to my daughters.
Don't worry. Why nothing will happen? Because you all did nothing for me.
So, now I will do whatever I have to do. Pooja, I am very disturbed.
Life is like hell to me. Sometimes I feel like committing suicide. Isnít there anybody in
this whole world who can help me? Sanjana, don't say like that. Pooja, whom should I go to? Where should I go and to whom should
I say whatever is happening with me? I felt that you are my friend,
but even you don't believe me. If you all don't believe me then.. Don't say that. I trust you completely. I believe all that you say.
The only thing is that.. Are you coming or is
your discussion yet pending? Come, we have to load
our baggage in the car. Yes coming.
Come with me inside.. Come. Listen, don't go anywhere. I am coming within five minute
to load the baggage in car. I want to talk with you.
Yes. - Don't go. Go fast and see what she is doing?
- Yes. Sanjana! Sanjana! Sanjana! Sanjana! Sanjana! How is all this happening? Have you seen Pooja? - Yes. I didnít do anything. Now do you believe me that I am not mad? And I am not imagining all these. I am sorry Sanjana. I didn't understand
what is happening with you. I am sorry. Sorry. Stay far from her.. stay far.
Stay far.. She is possessed. She is a shrew.. Get out from here. Are you showing black magic to us? You are a shrew. 'If you will try to hurt
us then I will kill you.' 'I will kill you.. Get out from here.' 'Get out from here.. Get out from here.' Excuse me. - Hello. Excuse me, please change this.
I don't want this. Since the day weíve bought this,
a Tibetan lady comes in my wifeís dreams.. And she says to return this
locket from whom you purchased it. Tibetan lady! Yes, Tibetan lady.. And today morning she came
in from the mirror and told that.. ..still you didnít
return that locket to her? This locket is not for you. Why don't you return this
locket from whom you buy it. Return it..
Return it.. Return it immediately. Return it immediately.. Go.
Go.. Go. If she meets you, tell her that
weíve returned this locket to you.. ..and we even don't want money,
enough. Please. Govind. - Yes Madam? Close the shop. - Ok. Sasha!.. Nisha! Mamma! Mamma! - Mamma! Nisha. Mom! Mom! Sasha!.. Sasha! asha!.. Mom!.. Mom! Mom!.. Mom! Mom!.. Mom.. Help! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Save me! Mom! Nisha! Mom! Mom! Mom! Sasha! - Mom! Sasha!.. Nisha! Sasha! Sasha! - Mom! Sasha!.. Nisha! Nisha! Nisha! Sasha! Sasha, give me hand. Sasha, give me hand. Sasha, give me hand. Give me hand, Sasha. Mom! Give me hand! Mom! Give me hand my child. Mom! Come.. Come.. Come. Come Sasha! Mom! Come, Sasha! Mom! Nisha.. Nisha! Nisha.. Nisha! Nisha!
- Come. Come soon. Nisha.. Nisha!
- Come. Let's go! Sanjana! What happened? Doctor, please help me. What happened, Sanjana? Nothing happened to me, he.. Relax.. Ok, relax. Tell me what happened? He took away my younger daughter, doctor. Who? Who took away your daughter? He took away. Please do some thing. Save my child. Okay. Listen.
Sanjana, I am trying to do something. Listen to me, I brought a
man who can understand your problem. He is a Parapsychologist, Ok.
Dr. S. P. Rana. What are you doing? Be brave. I am here. Let's go to your house and see. Come doctor. Doctor.. What do you think doctor? He is present here. Here is a soul with wrath.. ..and with the feeling of revenge. He is restless, but violent. He lives in hatred.. And wants to hurt. No my child.. Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid.. ..he would try to make
us afraid by every mean. I want to see that place where
your daughter was at last time. Yes, in the kid's bedroom. That.. Your daughter is alive, Sanjana. Sanjana. Sanjana. Sanjana. Do you believe me, do you? Yes. Sanjana, you should believe
on yourself completely. And to get back your daughter
you must fight with her. I am sure that you can to do it. I will fight with him
till my last breath, doctor. Yes.. It is necessary to know and
understand the enemy to fight with him. According to me, the soul
who die out with peace they goes.. ..to the eternal and immortal
light across the border of life and death. And one who decease sudden or
in an accident their soul lives here.. ..and then they got
the way in that light also. Wherever you go he will follow you. Can you see him? We don't have to see
to feel anyone's presence. Air! Can we see it? But when it blows we know it. Then too..
This soul would show itself to us. In the shape of deception..
it will try to trap us in illusion It will try to prevent me
because it knows that I am here. Like we know that it is here. But we will win. Because we are with
virtue and it is with flaw. Sanjana, let's go to
get back your daughter. Doctor. - Yeah. Is there anything to dig then bring it. Ok. - Hurry up. Mom. Don't be afraid. Nothing will happen. Don't worry. It can't harm us. Most of them has no body. Tell me one thing.
Did anything occur which startled you? Yes, some days before
there was a thunderbolt.. ..the villagers thought that it was an
unlucky omen that's why the did reverence. Can you show me that place?
- Yes, it is in front. Come. This is the place. You dig from here. Ok, doctor. This is the way to save your daughter. What is in it? This a hundred years old well
in which the aboriginal throws.. ..the criminal as punishment. Only God knows that how
many bad souls are buried in it. But one of them came out that
night when the thunderbolt fell. And he saw an easy prey in you. I know that your daughter is in it. And I will bring her out. In this creation of all-powerful Almighty.
An evil has no place. The evil that has risen from the
grave of darkness will return there in. Oh bad soul! The earth,
the sky and the wind nobody is with you. Give back the baby. You should give the baby because
the God is great not the devil. Not the darkness,
but the light is powerful Come out. I came here to fight with you. Come in front of me. No Sanjana, nothing will happen.
Don't worry. You can't harm me. This earth belongs to human beings,
not evils like you. Today I will give your end. I will finish you.. Iíll Finish you! Doctor Rana! No dear.. Mummy! Mummy! Your daughter is inside. Sanjana, only you can save your daughter. Don't be afraid Sanjana.. Jump. I said jump. Mom!.. Mom! Nisha. Nisha. Mom.. Mom.. Nisha!

device minor but not an elaborate away win over 7i again it's your back away and see you on my next video bye guys hey guys justin here of your tech and a couple of days ago huawei released one of its most affordable mid-range smartphones the y7a many people including us of course were impressed with its specs considering that it comes with such a budget-friendly price tag but does the y7a deserve a spot in a room where realme and xiaomi smartphones lead as most people's top choices for a bang for the buck smartphone we'll see undoubtedly the y7a is one of the prettiest and attractive smartphones we've seen it comes in this subtle pink gradient with its faint pink tinge in the middle no wonder this colorway is called blush gold it does look like blush however it's prone to fingerprint smudges and scratches due to its glossy coat so users might have to slap on a jelly case to remedy that the body is made up of plastic but it feels premium and solid we love its slim profile and holding it feels comfortable it also comes with quite a heft at 206 grams checking out its rear we get the vertically stacked 48 megapixel ai quad camera setup along with the huawei branding up front we see a rather large dot notch in the middle of the screen that houses the front camera and the call speaker and sensors on top of it we have the volume keys and the power or lock button acting as the fingerprint sensor on the right side the buttons feel sturdy and have a tactile feel to it on the left we have a triple card slot that can accommodate a dual nano sim and a dedicated micro sd card then up top we get a noise cancelling microphone while down below there's the usb type c port the primary microphone the 3.5 millimeter audio port and a single speaker grille for display the y7a sports a 6.67 inch full hd plus ips display with a resolution of 2400x1080 as far as quality goes it's great the colors are vibrant and punchy it's got a widescreen real estate so users will definitely enjoy watching content on this phone there's also the option to hide the notch just in case it bothers you users can also tweak the settings by adjusting the screen's color mode and temperature to their liking and changing the screen's resolution to either high or low to consume less battery in our case we mostly use the smart resolution as it adapts when it will automatically lower the resolution when it has to as for audio quality it's actually not that bad it's loud and clear though there's a noticeable distortion when the volume is set at max but other than that it's enough for casual listening running the y7a is emui 10.1 based on android 10. one thing we don't like with emui is its bloatware from the get-go we get several apps waiting to download while we have the option to delete them deleting them one by one can be cumbersome but on the bright side navigation is easy and users get nifty features like multi-window which is especially useful when multitasking users can also take a screenshot by knocking on the screen with a knuckle knocked once for taking screenshots and knock twice for taking screen record nice there's also a huawei assistant that shows you ai tips and news feed and other services that you can personally customize as we have mentioned time and time again huawei doesn't use google mobile services but don't worry as there's the huawei app gallery to download all the apps you need some of the new top apps you can find here include speed test gcash tick tock vlc and food panda there's also the petal search widget that allows you to install apps not only from the huawei app gallery but also from official and third party websites it also provides suggestions and trending apps information this is very useful the y7a is powered with a high silicon kirin 710a chip coupled with four gigabytes of ram a mali j51 mp4 gpu and 128 gigabytes of internal storage performance wise launching and loading apps is fast however it isn't that snappy what we do is turn off the advanced visual effects since the animation in blur adds loading time but that's just our preference even so navigation is smooth and multitasking is a breeze as for gaming we tried playing tension impact at the highest possible settings and as expected it's laggy and suffers from frame drops we tried setting it to medium and we often encounter stutters too [Music] also the back gets pretty hot after a long time for benchmarks we'll flash it on screen now for biometrics and security we get a side mounted fingerprint scanner and face recognition both of them work fast and we'd also like to note that the face recognition works even when we're wearing a mask though it's not as responsive and quick it also doesn't work if you're in a pitch black room but then again you have the fingerprint scanner for that when it comes to connectivity the y7a comes with wi-fi bluetooth 5.1 gps and 4g lte it offers a massive 5000mah battery with 22.5 huawei supercharge with this hands down you get an impressive battery life on this phone it could last us a day or two on a single charge which involves playing games and browsing on our social media it can even last longer if you lower the display resolution as for charging it took us less than nearly 2 hours probably around an hour and 45 minutes for it to be fully replenished in the pc mark's battery test the phone got a score of 22 hours and 30 minutes meanwhile in our standard video loop test it yielded an impressive 24 hours and 10 minutes okay let's finally talk about cameras the huawei y7a gets a quad rear camera setup consisting of a 48 megapixel main an 8 megapixel 120 degrees ultra wide a 2 megapixel depth and a 2 megapixel macro it also comes with a 6 times zoom meanwhile for selfies it comes with an 8 megapixel shooter it also comes with a bunch of camera features including aperture night mode portrait pro slo-mo panorama light painting and high resolution to name a few we tried its ai lens feature which is similar to google lens and it wasn't the quickest the instant translation isn't instantaneous to say the least and the calorie counter doesn't sometimes recognize food and is seldom inaccurate but the good news though is that the rest of the ai features work fast now for image quality they're good it comes with the right amount of sharpness though color production seems a bit saturated even with ai turned off basically what the ai does is boost the image's saturation and at times there's not much difference with it turned off or on so we prefer just having it turned off most of the time the ultra wide lens also does a pretty decent job and we appreciate that it doesn't produce much distortion the six times zoom isn't terrible either as you can see in low light situations photos came out muddy and noisy mostly when you use the ultra wide lens as you can see from these two photos the night mode isn't much of a help though there are instances that shots look pretty decent with the night mode on for bokeh we like it it has an excellent background to subject separation and users can go as low as f point 95 for that creamy bokeh effect it also comes with a high resolution feature that stays true to its name it comes with many details a better dynamic range and more flattering color reproduction now for selfies they're okay like what we mentioned with the rear cameras the colors look saturated and frequently the skin tone doesn't look natural nonetheless you can still get decent selfies with this phone now for videos it can shoot up to 1080p at 60 frames per seconds for the rear and 1080p at 30 frames per seconds for the front camera just in case you're wondering there's no support for eis so better keep your hands steady to avoid shaky footage and as far as quality goes it's pretty average we get relatively good footage in daylight but don't expect much at night it's muddy and peppered with noise okay so for our final thoughts we think that when it comes to bang for your buck smartphones most consumers first choice would probably be either from realme or xiaomi however we think the huawei y7a is a strong contender for this segment for 8 999 pesos you're actually getting good specs including a full hd plus display a decent processor a 48 megapixel quad camera setup and not to mention it's got an amazing battery life of course it also comes with few shortcomings like not being able to play graphically intensive games smoothly at high settings and lacking some stabilization for videos at this point we don't think that the lack of google mobile services is much of a disadvantage since the app gallery and the petal search widgets offer most of the apps you need but i'll be honest with you it can still be a challenge to download native google apps we really understand where the reluctance is coming from but it would be a waste not to give the y7a a chance seriously and there you have it what about you guys what are your thoughts on the huawei y7a let us know in the comments below also we'd like to share that huawei just launched its official e-commerce platform the

folding phone and easily its best yet this time they've changed the format and the folding screen is now protected inside the phone when it's closed which makes a lot of sense it's been a real pleasure over the last few years to be able to try out so many of these folding phones and see this new category of devices emerge and all the manufacturers have had such different approaches huawei's was always unusual because it wrapped the folding display around the outside of the device which looked super cool but did leave that delicate display vulnerable on the outside of the phone this time around they're taking a leaf out of samsung's book and putting the folding display on the inside of the phone where it's protected and there's a secondary display on the outside of the device actually i think they've taken a few leaves out of samsung's book this time around because this is very similar to the galaxy zed fold 2. from the fingerprint reader on the side here to the speaker on the bottom to the camera bump and the chunky hinge you can judge for yourself i thought folding phones might be the end of every phone looking largely the same but here we are now i remember saying when the galaxy fall 2 came out that it felt much sturdier than the original and that is the same here the mate x2 is a much better design than the original when it's open the screen snaps into place when it closes it snaps shut and it doesn't leave a gap which i think is a big improvement over samsung's design this is the first one of these i'd feel comfortable enough to throw in my gym bag like i would with my regular phone there's something else about this that i think is just a fantastic bit of engineering when i first started using it it felt really comfortable in my hand and i couldn't quite put my finger on why i've always been very scared of dropping these folding phones because they're typically very expensive and fragile but with this one i never felt like i was going to drop it it just sat very comfortably in my hand and here's why the phone is wedge shaped which moves the center of gravity closer into your right hand so when you're holding it here there's less weight over here it weighs about 300 grams which is more than a regular phone but because of this it doesn't feel like it the other thing i really like is the outside display because when this device is closed it's a full-size regular smartphone with no compromise you get pretty much the same experience as you would with a regular pro huawei smartphone including the great camera array as you'd expect from a flagship device if folding phones that turn into tablets are really going to take off then the folding part can't come at the expense of any other top feature that you'd expect on a pro smartphone and this i think is the closest we've got in terms of apps things haven't really changed over the last few months huawei is still on that u.s trade blacklist which means there are no google services on this device and i think that lets it down at least for a uk audience i would love to see a manufacturer create a full and uncompromised android experience without any google services but it hasn't happened yet you have to recreate an app store you have to build mapping services you have to get individual app developers to make their software compatible with your ecosystem it's a lot i thought huawei would be the one to do it but it hasn't really happened yet in full this is still a bit of a compromised experience you will find some popular apps like tick tock in the app gallery and the company says you can use petal search to find others it installs them from a third party which i think is a bit of a workaround and not a particularly great user experience some of the apps even flash up and warn you they may contain security threats but you can find popular apps like instagram and spotify that do work and it's really nice to switch between the phone display and tablet mode to see the content fill the screen i even managed to find google maps on there and it worked perfectly although other apps that require google maps services like ubereats will install but not run ultimately if this is released in the uk or u.s that will be a huge hurdle and it's a shame because i think huawei has just designed the finest folding phone so far hey what's up guys so we're back for another gadget review and this time we have the latest huawei mate book x pro which is the flagship of the mate book series they're also celebrating fighters of the matebook family and it has pioneered invasions ever since so as you see here from 2016 to 2020 they've created the most amazing laptops in the market so last 2016 huawei released the first generation of their laptop which is the two in one laptop then after a year they released the ultra slim laptop with industry's first fingerprint power button then in 2018 they launched the first laptop with the full view display then in 2019 they introduced a very cool feature which is the multi-screen collaboration and i really like this feature because it made things a lot easier then in 2020 they released the first infinite full view display which looks really stunning and of course this year they now released their new matebook lineup and one of their flagship laptop is here so before we talk about it let me show you their matebook line which is the new standard for intelligent laptops so first we have the matebook d15 which is the largest in the matebook family and this comes with a 15.6 inch full view display that offers 87 screen to body ratio it's powered by 11 gen intel core i5 processor coupled with 8 gigs of ram and 5 12 ssd storage it's wi-fi 6 capable and also has the new huawei sharp pin fan for better cooling it also has the huawei share feature and the onetouch all-access fingerprint slash power button by the way the d15 also has an iteration which is the d15i3 that is powered by 10th gen intel core i3 processor and the main difference between the two are the processor storage weight and price because the d15 i3 is lighter than the other one and it's also the most affordable in the matebook family but still packs a lot of good features and specs there's also a smaller version of the d15 which is the matebook d14 and they are basically the same in terms of specs the only major difference is the screen size because the d14 has a 14 inch display compared to the d15 that has 15.6 inch display also the d14 is slightly smaller thinner and lighter next is the matebook 14 which is their prime laptop that comes with a 14 inch 2k full view display and has a 90 screen to body ratio and this is also a touchscreen display with an eye comfort feature to protect your eyes during long hours of work it also has the multi-screen collaboration feature and it's powered by 11th gen intel core i5 coupled with 16 gigs of ram and 512 ssd storage then of course we got here is the top-of-the-line huawei matebook x pro which is huawei's flagship laptop now this comes with a windows 10 home os 11th gen intel core i7 which is 22 faster cpu performance than its predecessor 16 gigs of dual channel ram and intel core iris xe graphics one terabyte ssd storage and a blazing wi-fi six and with the specs mentioned i can say that it's an all-around laptop and highly capable which is good for video editors graphic designers people who work from home or even students for their home schooling right so moving on to the body the matebook x pro has a uni metal body design and diamond cut sand plastic finish and only 14.6 millimeter thin and weighs approximately 1.33 kilograms the screen is really gorgeous having just a very thin bezels making it a 91 screen to bother ratio it's also a 3k display and it's a 10-point multi-touch sensitive screen right so moving on to the touchpad now this one is an upgraded version of the huawei free touch and this offers smoother feedback and you can actually press any part of the touchpad and will still recognize the pressure and it's also where the built-in huawei share is located so you can simply tap your phone on the touchpad to send pictures or videos and it really happens so fast you can also double tap to enter multi-screen collaboration now this feature lets you access your phone via the matebook and you can simply drag and drop files from your phone to the mate boot so this is actually one of my favorite features of the huawei mate book x pro now moving on to the quad speaker setup they sound really good and has that deep bass in clear treble there's also a new pair of front facing microphone which can pick up your voice up to 5 meters away which is really cool right so moving on to the battery this has a 56 watt hour lithium polymer battery and based on my test i was able to play movies for straight nine and a half hours before it needs to be charged cooling is also enhanced with the new dual shark fin fan that works with the ultra slim vc heat dissipation module so that's a good upgrade from its predecessor and with all these features and upgrades then i highly recommend it especially if you guys are looking for a very portable laptop which is lightweight and thin bezel-less 3k display and you have the budget then go for the macbook x pro it's very elegant looking and packs a lot of advanced features or you can choose from the matebook family like the matebook 14 or d15 anyway they're all well built in technologically advanced so you won't go wrong if you choose any of it if you guys are interested you can buy these laptops online via the huawei store sharpie or lasada and if you buy the d15 starting from june 6 to july 17 you will get a free huawei band for word 1890 pesos huawei backpack also worth 1 890 and a huawei bluetooth speaker worth 1499. if you guys have any questions just drop it in the comments below also check the links in the description below to know more about the macbook family 2021 and the pricing thank you so much for watching and i'll see you guys in the next one [Music] [Applause] hey sis rhenium osmium badge on site Gen Richard Makaha that he embarked and prophesize

[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so slightly scarily it's been a couple of years almost since huawei launched its last big wearable the watch gt2 i still remember uh vividly unboxing it in a munich hotel room at 5 am with a stinking hangover i think my breath alone could have killed the polar bear from about 20 pieces and since then we've seen a few variants emerge like the one we watched gt2 pro the gt2e but only now almost halfway through 2021 so we finally have a true successor the huawei watch 3 sporting that fresh new harmony os this looks like a great bit of wearable tech pack and all kinds of great new features not found on earlier models what i'm going to do now is whip it on out of the box take you on a full on tour of the hardware and the software ahead of my in-depth review and the best part is this time around i'm not hungover in a bloody hotel room so that's always a bonus and for more on the latest greatest tech please do poke subscribe and ding that notifications bell cheers so first up of course what do you actually get in the box well the answer is one while we watch three you've also got one proprietary magnetic charger for powering up the huawei watch 3 when it's low on juice looks very similar to the one on the gt2 except now it's all connected you can't disconnect the head from the usb cable and that magnetic connection seems to be just as strong here on the while we watch three as on those earlier models as well take some serious jiggling to get it to disconnect despite the fact that the while we watch three is a bit of a hefty bugger how many other tech youtubers do the jiggle test not many that's right that's why you come to uncle spurt and you've also got a saucy bit of qr code action as well to have you download that huawei health app though it's freely available and likes the google play store and apple's app store as well and we'll be using that to set up the huawei watch three in a jiffy so as of right now the huawei watch three only comes in this one size that is 46 millimeters there might be a 42 millimeter version launched in the future but huawei is remaining tight lipped on that one first impressions i've got to say are pretty strong i really like the aesthetics here on the huawei watch 3 even though it is undeniably one hell of a chunky godzilla beast certainly a hefty more for as well you'll definitely feel that the first time you slap this thing on your wrist at least if you've got weedy little man-boy biceps like i do definitely check back for my full review for more on that but the stainless steel casing looks really nice hopefully will prove rugged as well as hopefully will that 3d curved glass because there's no bezel action to protect it from everyday scratches and scuffs if you fancy more premium finish we'll definitely check out the huawei watch 3 pro instead that'll come back in a beefier price tag of course but what you'll get is a sapphire display so that'll be hardier and tougher to scratch you also get a titanium body and a good bit of ceramic backing instead so in other words very similar design to the huawei watch gt2 pro as for the actual strap that you get bundled with the huawei watch three well that'll depend on which model you choose you've got the active for instance which comes with the flu raw elastomer strap which is great for if you're doing lots of exercise you've also got a classic which comes with the nylon strap and the elite model which comes packing a stainless steel link bracelet but just like most other huawei smartwatches as you can see there you can actually pull off the bands detach them entirely and attach a new pair uh to suit whatever you're going to be up to so slap on a leather band if you're going to be having a wild night out on the town whatever and yeah the one we watch three is fully water resistant you can rock it in the swimming pool get a good bit of swim tracking on the go as you can see here on the side of the while we watch three driver raw tier 10 crown which also doubles as the power button and then you've got another button down beneath as well so let's just power up the huawei watch threes if you've got any juice in the tank get it all set up and then we can tour the rest of the features thankfully pairing up with your smartphone is an absolute piece of piddle all you need to do is download the huawei health app the two will be connected in less than a minute so as i mentioned before this is the first one with small watch to come rocking a bit of harmony away so they'll touch but it seems fairly easy to get to grips with if basically used to wear os or any of the previous huawei smart watches first up i really like the main watch face that comes out as default it's packed with information although it doesn't feel too cluttered so first as it tells you just how active you've been you've got the main time and everything on there you've even got when the sun will set later that day you can have an alternative time setup as well if you've got a loved one in a different time zone and you've also got shortcuts on there to your call records if you want to see exactly who's been ringing and your bit of heart rate action too if you tap the little planet icon or simply swipe right then you will access the weather information well swiping the other way will bring up a whole bunch of widgets this is fully customizable showing you all of the information you want fast access to unfortunately right now at the time i shot this video there are very few actual uh widgets that you can play around with you basically got your activity records you got your heart rate monitor and you got your spo2 monitor as well and that is it even if you dive into the custom section there are no more that you can add to that selection hopefully that will improve soon though and then back at that main watch face swipe up in order to access any notifications that have trickled through either via the e sim or via your tethered smartphone and then if you swipe down you'll access a whole bunch of toggles and the settings and it's in here you'll also be able to check out the current date the current day of the week if you're that out of touch with what's actually going on uh the battery life and whether you're connected to the likes of wi-fi gotta say really liking uh the settings menu very comprehensive in terms of the toggles you've got access to all the usual stuff like do not disturb a torch feature alarms find my phone even the ability to drain the watch if you've been in water give that a little prod and basically the speakers will emit a pulse and that just helps to spit any liquids out of the orifice shake until baby oh yeah and the actual harmony os settings menu is very dense indeed you can customize all kinds of stuff on this thing uh so as you say you've got fast access the wi-fi connectivity if you don't have e-sim support i just want to save your ecm data and play around with the mobile and network settings turn on airplane mode if you need to check out the status you've got nfc support as well although i'm not sure if the while we watch three supports contactless pyramids it obviously won't support the likes of google up here but i'll check with while wait to see exactly what that does support you can fully customize the tiles or widgets as i mentioned before if you dive into display and brightness as you can see that's on automatic brightness and certainly seems very very bright and punchy on that default setting you can change up the sounds and vibration settings as well as you can see that change the ring volume the ai voice volume ring tones all kinds of stuff you can also turn on the likes of the ultra long battery life as well which i will touch on later when we mention the battery and you've got the huawei assistant on board this thing as well you can activate the voice assistant at any point by saying hey celia otherwise alternatively you can press and hold the down button and speaking of that down button you can configure exactly what happens when you tap that as well you can either completely disable it or have it bring up a specific feature and before i forget let's just put that assistant to the test so hey celia set a timer for 10 minutes sorry i didn't understand that uh hey celia set a timer for 10 minutes sorry i didn't understand that okay let's uh let's maybe try an easier one hey celia what day is it today sorry i didn't understand that ah in a freaking way i mean frankly she's understanding less than me after a case of scotch but uh never mind let's carry on the actual display is a 1.43 inch amoled panel 326 pixels per inch so as you can see even tiny little images and text nice and crisp and clear got to see the touch responsiveness is seeming a little bit iffy certainly right now it's early software and everything so i'm hoping that's going to improve but it does seem that occasionally certainly when you first wake up the watch uh then it occasionally takes a couple of sort of swipes to actually get it going like so but once you do get it going nice smooth transitions thanks to the 60 hertz refresh rate and as i said before certainly seems to be nice and bright uh even on that automatic brightness level uh should be absolutely fine for any outdoors use whatsoever and because it's an oled panel yes you do have a bit of always on display action as well as you can see there and that is also customizable just like the main watch face all you got to do is long press on it like so and then you can choose which one you want and as you can see you got quite a few options on there by default mostly digital uh but we've got a few analog style efforts as well you can set one of your gallery photos to be the main watch face in addition to that and you've also got the option of downloading or should i say uploading actually more watch faces to the watch via that health app to check out the other watch faces just go into the huawei health app and go to uh watch faces obviously and then there's a big old selection right there to choose from most of them will cost you one or two pounds but there are some free ones in there if you do a bit of hunting around if you're a skin flint and basically something that suits all tastes in there as well and of course you can get your own uh watch face on the go with the gallery selection here's one i made earlier this just allows you to choose any folder you've got on your smartphone use that as the background you can then change up the style of the time and the date from a limited selection unfortunately you can't actually change up the color uh just basically the font and the layout that just basically switches it from top to bottom that is it unfortunately there's no other extra complications or anything that you can add in there it's quite basic stuff but nice if you want a you know a photo of the fam or a pretty anime girl if you're an absolute nerd like me and they also have a different amount of information as well so basically it's all about your priorities what you want to have there on the main watch face every time you wake the watch 3 app and so far really like the neat little animations that homily os throws up so for instance when you wake this particular watch face as you can see there the temperature bar at the top springs into life that's a really neat effect and the always on display will match the main watch face as well which is again a really nice neat touch and the huawei watch 3 certainly comes packed with plenty of apps by default as well as you can see there you can zoom in and out of this new grid style setup kind of similar to the apple watches effort using that rotating dial and all the stuff you would uh expect to find on a huawei watch is present and correct all the stuff you generally find on those previous weather watches likes of timers alarms all your fitness features stress busters all presented really neatly in a really colorful bold fashion as well you do also have a huawei music app as well which allows you to actually stream music direct from the cloud if you like using your e-sim or the wi-fi connection but you will need a plus premium membership or whatever to actually get this working and unfortunately this doesn't work with other third-party services like diesel music and something that all the well-way watchers would not allow you to do is download new apps actually onto the watch but now you can do that thanks to the inclusion of huawei's app gallery so just like samsung smartwatches uh wear os devices etc you can actually download apps directly onto the watch uh via wi-fi or using that e-sim connectivity you don't even have to be tethered to your smartphone however because harmony os is obviously quite young compared to the likes of watch os and wear os the selection on offer is uh not exactly particularly great is uh there's a few gaps in there shall we say unlike previous huawei wearables as well lots of fitness support here on the huawei watch three as well including of course the good old workout uh tracking and i'm not kidding when i say it that pretty much anything you could possibly imagine is tracked by this thing you've got over a hundred different types of custom workout covering pretty much anything you could possibly think of i'm not kidding when i say that all tastes are cared for hula hoop frisbee darts does that even count as a sport laser tag tug of war swinging way and then basically select your chosen activity and then give a little tap to begin you'll get the funky dutch sounding guy telling you to start your workout i'll tell you exactly how long you've been exercising for how your heart rate's doing as you can see i'm really enjoying doing this video and how many calories you've burnt so far and you can also get some other uh stats of the goal sort of depending on obviously what activity you are doing and then you can pause it at any time and then cancel the workout as well you've got the usual gps smarts built in there of course as you'd expect if you upgrade to the pro model you've actually got dual channel gps for pin point precision and like previous generations of huawei watches well the huawei watch 3 can automatically detect when you start to do an exercise and start tracking that for you with your permission although i'm not sure how good it'll be previous generations occasionally you'd be walking for a good mile or so before it actually clocked that you weren't just sitting on your ass anymore so again stay tuned for my full in-depth review for more and all that you've got plenty of the health smarts built into this so you've got the usual 24-hour uh heart rate tracking of course just leave it there on your wrist it will see how your pulse is doing throughout the day you've also got a temperature sensor built in there for continuous skin temperature tracking and continuous uh 24-hour seven days a week sp02 monitoring as well there's also the obligatory stress tracking and i'm not actually sure how good that really is because i just had a mini meltdown over a brand new microphone not working and as you can see that didn't even register on the scale and a good bit of sleep tracking as you can see there i got about eight hours of sleep last night that's actually fairly accurate um it didn't register when i was just plonked on the sofa just watching tv which is good because a lot of the the lesser sleep trackers do do that as you can see there yeah pretty much accurately tracked how much kip i got you don't get much information actually on the watch itself but if you jump on into the huawei health app again you can see a bit more detail as you can see there light and deep sleep it gives you a score on how good your sleeping abilities are breaks down into rem sleep all of that good stuff and considering i had my first corvette job yesterday but i apparently slept all right now when it comes to your battery life the one we watch three is definitely a step down from previous huawei watches but that's only because it's got a built-in e sim support as well so if you've got the e-sim active then huawei reckons you'll get probably about three days of full-on use with all the features going in the background as well i've just been using the wi-fi and obviously the partnership with my smartphone on this thing so far and it looks like around three to four days of used is actually probably what i'll get with that even without the esim action on the go because if that's not good enough for you you can turn on the ultra long battery mode this will extend the battery life up to two weeks but that will deactivate most of the features like the e-sim but if the wi-fi gets knocked off it just uses the tethered features and all it gives you is basically the animated watch faces and a couple of the other sort of standard features you would use and that is it the fitness tracking is severely curtailed there as well you've still got access to about sort of 14 15 activity modes i believe it is but that's it if that does seriously put you off though you could always upgrade to that pro model because apparently that will extend the battery life to five days of standard use or up to three weeks 21 days with that ultra long battery mode so anyway that in a nutshell is the huawei watch three and as i see i will keep it slapped on my wrist for the next sort of week or two fully test out the fitness tracking features the battery life all that good stuff to see how good they really are and hopefully bring you that in-depth review soon in the meantime it would be fantastic to hear your own thoughts on the huawei watch three or you're tempted by it don't have an official uk pricing or released it just yet because i'm shooting this ahead of the official launch hopefully by the time the review rolls around we'll actually have that information so cheers for watching please do poke subscribe and do that notifications bell for more on the latest and greatest second have yourselves a fantastic rest of the week cheers everyone love you [Music] you hey guys welcome back to another video hey guys welcome back to another video with lim

also have your weather there's a slight animation going on there's a slight animation going on there if you can see it's there if you can see it's lightning going on right there if you lightning going on right there if you move on this is where you get your music move on this is where you get your music control so again this obviously does not control so again this obviously does not come with any internal memory so you come with any internal memory so you can't put music can't put music in the band itself you can only control in the band itself you can only control your music playback your music playback and if you swipe once more this is where and if you swipe once more this is where you get into your status or your you get into your status or your activity activity goals for the day obviously i have been goals for the day obviously i have been sitting mostly indoors so sitting mostly indoors so my rings are not yet completed but my rings are not yet completed but that's what you get here so if you swipe that's what you get here so if you swipe back this is where you get back into the back this is where you get back into the main page so basically it is just a loop main page so basically it is just a loop that goes all around until you come back that goes all around until you come back to the main watch phase to the main watch phase all right so now let's check out the all right so now let's check out the menus itself and what else is in menus itself and what else is in so we'll start off with your workouts as so we'll start off with your workouts as well uh i'll go into that later on your well uh i'll go into that later on your workouts you have your workout records workouts you have your workout records your heart rate obviously we also have your heart rate obviously we also have your spo2 so your spo2 so huawei is saying that this has all-day huawei is saying that this has all-day spot readings but spot readings but based on my current experience i'm not based on my current experience i'm not able to set that in the app i think it able to set that in the app i think it will come in a later update will come in a later update so for now you still have to actually so for now you still have to actually tap the measure button yourself tap the measure button yourself to measure your spo tools manually it to measure your spo tools manually it also takes about a minute to get that also takes about a minute to get that reading reading so yeah just bear that in mind moving so yeah just bear that in mind moving down you also have your activity records down you also have your activity records right here so this is what you see right here so this is what you see earlier on earlier on your rings and if you go down you can your rings and if you go down you can actually see more information here actually see more information here how many steps you've actually walked how many steps you've actually walked how much distance you've covered how much distance you've covered how many hours you're active so quite a how many hours you're active so quite a lot of information here actually lot of information here actually directly on the huawei band 6. directly on the huawei band 6. so moving down we're going to check out so moving down we're going to check out our sleep so i really love the fact that our sleep so i really love the fact that we have the sleep we have the sleep information directly on the band itself information directly on the band itself so on the me band 6 for example you have so on the me band 6 for example you have to check out your phone to actually to check out your phone to actually see your your sleep records but here on see your your sleep records but here on the huawei band 6 you can see your sleep the huawei band 6 you can see your sleep record right away record right away if you just scroll down you can actually if you just scroll down you can actually see how many see how many hours of naps for example was taken your hours of naps for example was taken your total sleep from what time to what time total sleep from what time to what time and of course it will tell you that more and of course it will tell you that more details can be found in the huawei details can be found in the huawei health app where it will show you your health app where it will show you your your rem your light sleep and your deep your rem your light sleep and your deep sleep and all that kind of stuff there sleep and all that kind of stuff there so but it's still good to see that uh so but it's still good to see that uh you can tell how much how many hours you you can tell how much how many hours you have slept in your previous night have slept in your previous night so that's the sleep if you move down to so that's the sleep if you move down to the stress again this is what i talked a the stress again this is what i talked a little bit about just now but here you little bit about just now but here you have a bit more information so it tells have a bit more information so it tells you how much stress you've been having you how much stress you've been having throughout the entire day throughout the entire day uh your normal rate your medium and your uh your normal rate your medium and your high so this will also high so this will also give you a brief idea on how your give you a brief idea on how your overall day was going on overall day was going on and whether you've had a stressful day and whether you've had a stressful day and i just want to take a little bit of and i just want to take a little bit of rest rest all right so moving down this menu it all right so moving down this menu it says here overall i am normal so says here overall i am normal so it is good to be relaxed and the right it is good to be relaxed and the right amount of stress is a good source of amount of stress is a good source of motivation when handled properly so motivation when handled properly so some kind facts there by huawei so just some kind facts there by huawei so just so you know so you know moving down the list let's check out the moving down the list let's check out the breeding exercises so obviously this breeding exercises so obviously this we have a couple of intervals here a few we have a couple of intervals here a few minutes as well minutes as well going back we have our music controls going back we have our music controls not going to go into that your not going to go into that your notifications notifications uh i just showed you this now your uh i just showed you this now your notifications and of course your weather notifications and of course your weather so this time in the weather uh in the so this time in the weather uh in the weather app itself you will be able to weather app itself you will be able to see your see your seven day weather forecast right here seven day weather forecast right here you can see everything is laid out very you can see everything is laid out very clearly and because we have this clearly and because we have this rather large display here you can see rather large display here you can see everything here very nicely in this everything here very nicely in this beautiful beautiful graphics and all that so if you just go graphics and all that so if you just go down somewhere you can also see today down somewhere you can also see today and tomorrow your lows and your highs and tomorrow your lows and your highs and of course whether it will rain or and of course whether it will rain or not so lots of information there not so lots of information there moving down once more this is where you moving down once more this is where you get a stopwatch nothing too much to talk get a stopwatch nothing too much to talk about that stopwatch is just about that stopwatch is just as straightforward as it gets so it's as straightforward as it gets so it's timer and your alarms timer and your alarms moving down we also have your flashlight moving down we also have your flashlight so this is again very straightforward so this is again very straightforward and you have your find your phone and you have your find your phone feature as well as your settings feature as well as your settings all right so now let's go back to the all right so now let's go back to the top here and check out the amount what top here and check out the amount what kind of activities it has kind of activities it has because huawei is advertising this smart because huawei is advertising this smart band here to support up to 96 band here to support up to 96 different workout modes so does it different workout modes so does it really support that many modes uh let me really support that many modes uh let me just explain to you a little bit more just explain to you a little bit more so first up obviously we have our indoor so first up obviously we have our indoor runs your outdoor walking runs your outdoor walking i believe you have your cycling as well i believe you have your cycling as well you're swimming so swimming is supported you're swimming so swimming is supported here here you have your jump rope your elliptical you have your jump rope your elliptical your rover and a couple more other stuff your rover and a couple more other stuff here so if you want to here so if you want to access the more activities mode you have access the more activities mode you have to go into your widgets right here and to go into your widgets right here and just hit the plus button just hit the plus button so this is where you will actually be so this is where you will actually be able to see everything or able to see everything or all kinds of activities that you can all kinds of activities that you can track using the huawei track using the huawei band 6 right here so let's just check band 6 right here so let's just check out what we have here so we do have our out what we have here so we do have our strength strength your spinning a stepper air walker yoga your spinning a stepper air walker yoga crossfit so crossfit so there's a lot of activities in here i'm there's a lot of activities in here i'm just going to scroll slowly so you can just going to scroll slowly so you can see what's in there see what's in there and yeah you can say you can just see and yeah you can say you can just see that the list just goes on and on you that the list just goes on and on you have have horse riding laser tag kite flying i horse riding laser tag kite flying i mean like seriously mean like seriously do you track do you do you think of that do you track do you do you think of that as like a like a sport activity or as like a like a sport activity or something something but yeah this is what you get with the but yeah this is what you get with the additional activities here so let's just additional activities here so let's just see what is actually being tracked in see what is actually being tracked in one of these kind of activities right one of these kind of activities right here so here so let me just choose uh body combat for let me just choose uh body combat for now i'm going to add that now i'm going to add that i'm also going to add street dance so in i'm also going to add street dance so in case any of you case any of you does street dance it's going to add that does street dance it's going to add that in so i have that in so let's check out in so i have that in so let's check out what it actually tracks during your what it actually tracks during your street dance so if i tap that and i just street dance so if i tap that and i just hit go hit go this is what it actually tracks here so this is what it actually tracks here so you have your heart rate you have your heart rate standard stuff you also have your standard stuff you also have your training stress training stress let me see a little bit more your let me see a little bit more your calories okay calories okay this is based on your heart rate how is this is based on your heart rate how is it performing over your activity it performing over your activity and that's pretty much it guys so this and that's pretty much it guys so this is pretty much the same items that is pretty much the same items that you'll be tracking for all the other you'll be tracking for all the other miscellaneous kind of activities like miscellaneous kind of activities like your badminton your taekwondo and all your badminton your taekwondo and all that that so although huawei says this is tracking so although huawei says this is tracking up to 96 different up to 96 different activities what it just means is just activities what it just means is just any activities that they can think of any activities that they can think of because because these are just standard stuff guys i these are just standard stuff guys i mean it's not to say like it's tracking mean it's not to say like it's tracking your hand movements or whatnot you know your hand movements or whatnot you know it's just tracking the basic stuff of it's just tracking the basic stuff of course the main activities that you will course the main activities that you will be tracking with this is your runs be tracking with this is your runs and of course your cycling because that and of course your cycling because that will use a gps it will track your will use a gps it will track your distance and your pace but distance and your pace but you're not getting any of this tracking you're not getting any of this tracking on the other activities so on the other activities so i would think of this as mostly like a i would think of this as mostly like a 10 activity uh main activity kind of 10 activity uh main activity kind of tracking device so tracking device so it doesn't come with gps bear in mind it doesn't come with gps bear in mind you will have to connect your you will have to connect your your smart band here to the huawei your smart band here to the huawei health app that i have here health app that i have here pre-installed pre-installed yeah so just bearing in mind effectively yeah so just bearing in mind effectively it is not able to track that many things it is not able to track that many things but but if you just must try something yeah it if you just must try something yeah it is in the list all right so that's it is in the list all right so that's it for the for the workout modes um apart from that i think workout modes um apart from that i think um yep um yep if you notice here there is your if you notice here there is your recovery time so you can actually see recovery time so you can actually see your recovery time on the band itself so your recovery time on the band itself so let's say for example you do take a a let's say for example you do take a a run or you do a workout or something run or you do a workout or something the band here will actually advise you the band here will actually advise you on how many hours it takes to recover on how many hours it takes to recover yourself yourself and when you will be prepared for the and when you will be prepared for the next activity all right guys i think next activity all right guys i think that's pretty much it for the that's pretty much it for the huawei band 6. again this is going for huawei band 6. again this is going for 219 ringgit here in malaysia or 219 ringgit here in malaysia or approximately 53 us dollars approximately 53 us dollars let me just put it quickly on my wrist let me just put it quickly on my wrist in case someone says in case someone says that i never put on these bands or smart that i never put on these bands or smart watches or whatnot watches or whatnot yeah if you're watching this do give me yeah if you're watching this do give me a like if you like these kind of videos a like if you like these kind of videos any likes or any support is always any likes or any support is always welcome uh on the channel

uh the mi band looks really really good uh the mi band looks really tiny on tiny on your wrist but the huawei band sticks your wrist but the huawei band sticks here looks perfectly fine here looks perfectly fine in terms of the performance a in terms of the performance a side-by-side comparison let me know in side-by-side comparison let me know in the comments below if you would like to the comments below if you would like to see that see that so i can provide one for you yeah there so i can provide one for you yeah there you go you go this is the huawei band 6. oops this is the huawei band 6. oops all right guys if you have any more all right guys if you have any more questions about the huawei band 6 please questions about the huawei band 6 please let me know down in the comment section let me know down in the comment section below below and i'll see you guys in the next one and i'll see you guys in the next one bye bye hey everybody hope you guys are healthy and safe so i have here the huawei mate x2 and after holding this phone for about five six minutes yeah i'm completely blown away this hardware is indeed the best hardware i've seen in a foldable yet okay so first things first this is not a review unit from huawei they did not make it available to me instead this is a retail unit from china on loan from my friend simon of trinity electronics in hong kong anyway let's take a look at the overall hardware and why i think the huawei mate x2 is the best foldable hardware i've seen yet and keep in mind i've been using the galaxy z42 for four months now the reason why i like the hardware of this phone better is when the device is folded look at the screen it's a lot more wider than the gauss's e42 the gauss's evo 2 it feels pretty cool but you can encode it one hand easily but a lot of apps you actually look really weird because of how tall this aspect ratio is this is a 25 by 9 aspect ratio whereas on the may x2 you have a 21 by 9 aspect ratio now this is still a little bit long but it's more natural it's closer to a regular smartphone than this screen here this screen if you're typing on this it is still slightly cramped now the second important part is the mate x2 actually folds flatter than the zfo2 it's actually a thinner device too so i'm going to stack them on top of each other so you see that the zfo 2's hinge actually leaves a little bit of a gap right here still and doesn't fold completely flat whereas the mate x2 folds completely flat and the max 2 is a little bit thinner of course the screen is also larger when you unfold the devices so when you unfold you have an 8 inch display here it's a 90 hertz panel so the 42 one upside here because it's a 120 hertz panel on the inside but 90 hertz actually looks smooth enough to me already of course i'll take 120 if i can but 90 hertz is more than fine enough so huawei makes 2 has a larger display without any interruptions that's because there is no selfie camera inside the phone whereas on the photo you do have a hole punch for selfie camera now whether or not this is a good thing depends on you if you're someone who takes a lot of selfies maybe you prefer to have a secondary selfie camera here but for me i don't really take selfies much i don't have to face with selfies so i actually rather to have an uninterrupted tablet screen now because this is such a larger display everything just looks a little bit more immersive on it including instagram you guys know how much i like scrolling through instagram on a tablet size screen right like for example shout out to my friend ben right here but yeah this is an instagram story doesn't it look a little bit more immersive when it spans the entire display on the may x2 it looks even more immersive because you have a larger display speaking of display when it's unfolded the may x2 also doesn't have as noticeable or crease so you look at the full two if i move a little bit you see the crease right now the mate x2 i'm gonna put it at the same angle you see you don't see so much of a crease but hey that's me my girlfriend and my friend fred but you see there's not much of a crease no matter how i move the under the sun whereas the full two you do see a noticeable crease now because the may x2 has a more natural aspect ratio when you open two apps side-by-side in split screen mode it actually fills up a little bit more naturally than on the z42 you notice this evo too there's a little bit of leather boxing at the top when you run two apps side by side that's because of the aspect ratio of this 7.2 inch display whereas on the mate x2 when you open two up side by side it actually fills up the screen so multitasking on the max2 is relatively easy to do so you open one app you just have to swipe from the side and hold and you'll get this little pull over menu right here and from here just tap an app if you just tap on it it'll open the app in a floating window but if you long trust the app hold it and then you bring it here then it will go into split screen mode and now i have two apps at the same time i haven't taken any photos with this phone yet so that's why the gallery is empty but speaking of cameras this is another area where the huawei mate x2 has one up to the gauss's e42 you see this camera system here it has a periscope zoom lens right here it's not just a weak periscope zoom lens this is a ten times optical zoom lens so the same one used in the huawei mate 40 pro plus and huawei p40 pro plus so this is pretty amazing the fact that huawei crammed a periscope zoom lens into a device that is this thin now the galaxy z42 has a pretty good camera system but it's definitely not samsung's best even going by the standards when this phone came out last year this camera system is not as good as what was seen in the samsung galaxy note 20 ultra it does not have the 108 megapixel camera and it does not have a periscope zoom in so you're just getting a standard telephoto zoom lens here whereas with the mate x2 you get legit zoom in fact let's test it out right now so we're going to do a one times photo and we'll go 10 times so this is 10 times lossless zoom you can always see this is a very sharp 10x zoom let's go up to 30x so 30x still looks really sharp and go up to 100x okay now i have the gauss's default here i'm going to take the exact same shot so 1x 10x and then we'll go maximum it only maxes out a 10x for photos actually because this is a pretty weak telephoto zoom lens so you see that this periscope zoom lens has relatively good optical image stabilization because you see when i'm at 10 times i'mma hold the phone just with one hand and it's still pretty stable probably not as stable as what the s21 ultra can do but it's pretty good i'm at 33 times zoom now completely holding the phone with one hand okay so as for selfies like i mentioned there is no selfie camera inside the folder display there's only one on the outside so it takes selfies you either just take it like in this folded form or you can unfold the phone tap on the selfie camera and then you have to flip the phone over and then right here now you can use this main camera system for selfies so this is going to give you high quality selfies although this is a little bit awkward to do you have to unfold the phone tap a button and bring it back but now in theory you should be able to get 10 times zoom with selfies which is crazy yeah okay yeah nobody wants to take ten times oh yeah nobody wants to take 10 times room photos on my face like that but you do get this system that means you can vlog with this camera pretty easily too because now you can just vlog this camera switch the ultra wide angle camera and now you can record a vlog with this main camera system pointing at yourself so yeah like i said the huawei mate x2 is the best foldable hardware i've seen yet but of course the alpha in the room is that the mate x2 like the last three four or five huawei phones cannot run google apps out of the box because of the us government sanctions now good news for those of you who are into messing with your phones is that you can sideload google on this phone via this unofficial hack it's basically the same method that people have been using to put google services on the mate 40 and the p40 before that so it's not something i can recommend for everybody and in fact if you have a google account that's tied to very important stuff then i wouldn't suggest doing this but maybe you can set up the google and then use a burner google account meaning just make up a secondary google account that's not that important to you and use that google account to run youtube google maps all that so for people who really want to use that phone that might be an option worth considering i'm pretty sure in a couple of weeks there will be youtube videos or maybe on xda there will be tutorials on how to install google on this phone it's quite complicated it's going to take like 10 minutes of setting up the phone but it is doable that's what the word on the street is from simon so anyway that's about it for this first look at the huawei mate x2 man i can't wait to have one for myself right now this phone it's completely sold out everywhere in fact i have to return this to simon soon because some guy is going to come buy from him for 4 000 us dollars it's a markup over the retail price people in hong kong and east asia are crazy when it comes to spending so this phone is in such high demand that people are willing to pay 1 000 to 1 500 above market value price i'm not gonna pay that i'm gonna wait until the phone price drop closer to retail price then i'm gonna buy one for myself um so yeah that's about it for this first look thank you again to simon of trinity electronics for loaning me this device i am super super impressed this is the best stamp foldable hardware ever now to be fair the xefo 2 is like five six months old now so that means when the z43 come out in five months four months it might actually match this in terms of hardware maybe samsung will be able to put a periscope zoom lens in there maybe samsung will make the fold a little bit flatter as of right now if we compare these two phones hardware no contest this is a better hardware all around so anyway that's it for this video if you're interested in keeping up to date with more content please subscribe to my channel follow me on instagram at ben's gadget reviews i have a lot more stuff coming up including i have a full review of the oppo 5x3 pro the redmi note 10 pro and a bunch of other devices too and hopefully when i get my hand on this for longer term i'm going to do a full review too so thanks for watching [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] okay we are back the event just took place the livestream actually well for a variety of p40 series devices from huawei the one that I have today is the p40 pro this one is the matte gray color but they put out so many models today including a plus version of this they put out a tremendous number of color options there was the p40 regular version so that makes p40 p40 Pro P 40 Pro Plus and then a variety of color availability within there all the way up to a Penta camera set up on the Pro Plus model funny enough when I was watching the live stream I was hoping that I would get the silver version and that's what I got anyways Koh engineered with Leica and if you look at the bottom side of the box there part of the Box you see explore it on App gallery so obviously Huawei is advertising their own app store in the absence of the Google stores and they're gonna try to you know they're gonna aim to get as many developers interested or excited about their app store as possible they did name a few during the live broadcast they're gonna want to expand that to keep people interested in this device and any of their devices going forward okay so here is the phone Oh interesting that kind of looks different than what I expected for the color it's got a little more blue tone to it it's really shimmery and cool-looking though so it is a matte finish that's on there now this back being this matte finish makes it quite a bit different than what you're seeing in the marketplace of course I've seen it before this combination of matte finish which still has a shimmer to it and a bit of a reflectiveness but still mostly matte it included a kind of basic clear case just to get you protected straight out the gate this this is just your USB cable to charge it up USB type-c something that was really exciting that they announced 40 watt wireless charging for the Pro Plus model me I get excited about weird things including very fast charging and if it can be Wireless that's just an even more of a bonus but this one does include a fast charging power brick supercharged power brick which is also 40 watts yeah right there supercharged 40 watts max from the wired connection and they also give you some type C earbuds there's no headphone jack obviously because I should also mention of course alway makes they're fully wireless earbuds the free buds 3 and if you head over to my Twitter account right now there's a giveaway for two of these in fact as well as two of these guys watch gt2 this is the two week battery SmartWatch so all you have to do is retweet a tweet that's it it's pretty simple so go check that out ok here is the device and I'm gonna go ahead and boot it up real quick now it has a pill style cut out on the front for your front-facing cameras but this implementation is actually a little bit different because it's a single 32 megapixel camera and then in IR which is gonna help with more secure face on lock this is cool to how the frame of the device you can see it sort of juts up in the corners you see how it sort of just juts up in the corner there and then drops back down for your waterfall edge along the side a USB type-c connector on the bottom and that's where your speaker is as well and we have our SIM card tray in that location also around the side of the device is where you're gonna find your power switch as well as your volume rocker this is gonna give you an idea of that screen to body ratio and just how that bezel operates with the waterfall design there's a bit more of a bezel than showed up in the presentation but somehow the curvature of the glass and the reflection that it creates actually allows for a greater impression screen to body ratio then might actually be there especially on the forehead here of course we're in a pretty crazy territory right now for screen to body ratio and just how aggressive manufacturers are getting I think it's just sort of a science fiction effect where you feel like you're holding all screen and that can be exciting you kind of want to feel like you're holding the future and that's that's the whole initiative with these screen types alright so for unlock options we have fingerprint which is in display and we have face recognition now I'm a fan of face unlock when it works quickly I hate it when there's any kind of delay to it or secondary step I've used the optical based face on locks on various devices but the question the the problem is whether or not they're properly secured of course you've seen on this channel I've used pictures of myself videos of myself to unlock other devices that are strictly optical so it appears that hallways angle here is to go with the more secure style face unlock including IR and then on the Apple side you don't get the fingerprint unlock in conjunction which I think a lot of people would like having both versions devices I've used where I have both options there are times where it's more convenient to use the fingerprint and times where it's more convenient to use the face unlock setup face recognition and include enable raise to wake this is the ultimate setup you just lift it up okay cool alright there isn't this activity which existed in the past with other manufacturers not necessary now it asks to do a fingerprint as well so I might as well do that okay so the device is set up now I'm gonna blast the brightness for you to give you an idea of what that OLED is looking like there you go that's full pop brightness this also gives you an idea of the camera cutout you can see at the top there considerations with this when you're doing front-facing images you get it tilt it just a little bit because it is off-center advantage there's it's a bit less distracting as having a large notch in the center of the display when you're watching the video and stuff like that by default a lot of manufacturers still have the two-stage thing where you have to swipe up after it identifies you now often you can turn that off it feels so much faster without the slide so this is something I wish Apple let you do to directly go into the interface when it sees your face I understand the advantage of the two-step thing there's something so satisfying about just hitting the switch and being in it almost whoa what hang on it's crazy fast all right hold up it's instant it's a very very quick face on lock in display fingerprint as a secondary option so I like this I think a lot of other manufacturers should have this do this face plus fingerprint it's the right way to go all right now obviously the camera setup that's a big deal you're gonna be very interested this is kind of the trend I mean obviously you're aware of it it's like these things are increasingly becoming cameras with smartphones in them the widest shot we can get so that is that is a pretty cool image now I know it's just a bottle of water but surprisingly it got some detail out of it and it managed the exposure in a really difficult environment more towards the text and the blue portion of the bottle now keep in mind this is the ultra wide but they still have a pretty big aperture on their ultra wide camera the 1x camera is gonna outperform on almost any smartphone probably just an overall kind of sharpness and detail I would say so but it's a different camera for a different purpose right now we have 5x spoon and I might as well well in here do a quick 10x as well all right so this is pretty wild you can see the versatility of camera options all right so this is what you're gonna get with 10x and then if we swipe over that's your 5x shot and then we move over that's your standard 1x and that's your ultra wide right there it's a lot of versatility smartphones in 2020 got to bring the versatility particularly in the camera Department um I guess I'll load up some loot later real quick also I just want to give a shout out to everybody who's been on the live streams on the loo later channel as I've sort of been dealing with the solo enterprise here at the studio I'm trying to I rearrange things and you remember yesterday when I was on here I had no audio on the jump [Music] almost forgot we have to do a selfie let's go ahead I'm gonna turn the beauty effects off so you see the beard hairs as nature intended and let's go ahead and grab one real quick oh wow okay well that is beyond that is tremendous detail I hope you can appreciate it there there's a beard hair off to the side they're jumping out of jumping off the face needing a trim they've been doing it in the camera department no doubt I was sitting there thinking about previous events I went to when I first saw night mode and I was blown away when when he started putting a tremendous number of cameras on there and now of course you checked the industry and it's like everybody's got these cameras everybody's got the night mode during the presentation you can go back and watch it it's on the channel they were citing some camera specs on this thing that we're bananas all that aside it's impossible to really look at this phone and talk about this phone without referencing the fact that Google is really not involved and if you're in a part of the world where you rely on Google services you need to know that as it stands there is obviously conflict not necessarily conflict between the companies of software companies service providers in Huawei there's restrictions in place that are not allowing those companies to work together will that be the case forever of course I don't know nobody knows in the meantime Huawei has its own app gallery is it gonna have what you need of course you're gonna have to take a look for yourself now I know the power users are out there saying I don't care I'm just gonna side load my app I'm gonna mod it up I'm gonna completely configure it the way that I want and that's fine those people are gonna exist but as far as out of the box as far as software updates go and so forth it's a bit of it's kind of some untested waters so it's important to put that disclaimer out there for the time being this phone not so Google granted as you saw you jump into the browser you still get on YouTube I mean it's not an impossible hurdle to overcome it's just a kind of it's a thing you need to be aware of so the new silver color Matt finish with the tremendous camera module on there this is the pro version I do want to check out the Pro Plus and the supercharger wireless supercharged at 40 watts it is the new P 40 Pro from Huawei [Music]

and safe so i have an unboxing today of the huawei mate view so this is huawei's new external monitor it's 28 inches with 4k resolution but what sets it apart from most other monitors on the market is that it has a three by two aspect ratio meaning it's a little bit taller and i like that because it's great for productivity because most external monitors out there right now have a wider aspect ratio of 16 by 9 or sometimes 16 by 10. i think most of us who review laptops and screens agree that 3x2 is a little bit more ideal aspect ratio for work if you're watching videos and movies then a widescreen monitor is better but let's check it out the package okay let's see what's in this small box first all right so we have some papers warranty information this is a typeseeded type c cable type c type c okay we have here charging brake unfortunately i will need an adapter to use this in hong kong because this is not a hong kong plug and then we have here a display port cable okay so this is the huawei mate view as you can see it's a pretty sleek aluminum body really sleek and thin looking just look at how thin this display part is and also this little stand right here and as you can already see i can elevate the screen the height of the display you know higher or lower by just pushing and pulling and that's it stays in place magically so you don't need to press any buttons and you push it down it stays in place pull it up it stays in place now down here is a base and you see here there's an nfc logo this is where you can tap the huawei smartphone to connect your huawei smartphone to the monitor and down here this appears to be a speaker grille i will put that to the test later so over here you have two usb a ports a usbc a headphone jack and this as soon as the power button now on the back here you have another usbc thunderbolt port so this is i assume to power the external monitor a display port and an hdmi port so for the most part you don't need any of these usbc can already plug into your computer okay so earlier i forgot to mention that another unique feature of this huawei mate view is this little touch sensitive bar down here i just have to slide my finger left to right you see it will move across so now i'm going to go into here this says input so i just tap and it will jump into the settings now i can choose my input mini displayport hdmi usbc i'm gonna choose usbc so i have a huawei matebook x pro here i'm just gonna plug it in power it on and okay so now it is mirroring the screen but we're gonna go extend the view okay so you see how much more screen real estate you have on a 28 inch three by two aspect ratio this is 4k resolution so all the text is super crisp i think you can adjust volume all back here oh yeah so give it just volume by just sliding on the bar so you see because this is a three by two aspect ratio it's actually not the ideal for watching movies because you have major letter boxing unless you're watching the snyder cut if you're watching the snyder cut then it actually fills up properly because he shot it in a weird three by two aspect ratio but most hollywood films shoot in this widescreen aspect ratio so you get a lot of on the left and right so this monitor is it's more suited for productivity than for watching movies like this so unfortunately this is only a 60 hertz refresh rate it is not a high refresh rate display but for productivity driven monitor i think it's fine this is not meant for gaming okay let's try another laptop this is the huawei matebook x pro so obviously it was going to work flawlessly now let's try my macbook pro 16-inch yep it works perfectly on a mac too so this being a 4k monitor you can watch footage in native 4k resolution if your video supports it okay so this is the huawei mate view it is already on sale in china for about 5 300 rmb that converts to about 730 us dollars this will launch very soon in europe i believe starting in the uk and other parts of western europe too you can expect prices to be around similar to 730 us dollars now obviously you can find a cheaper monitor out there but for a monitor that has 4k resolution and has a really kind of new modern design slim bezels and kind of like a freely adjustable stand it's quite hard to find at this price for example my dell monitor right now it's only 1080p resolution the stand is fixed so when i use it sometimes i have to put a bunch of books under if i want the screen to be a little bit higher it does not have built-in speakers and it does not have any nfc functionality and even that monitor goes for about 400 us dollars right now so if you're on the market for a new monitor this is a pretty good option especially if you're using a huawei smartphone because if you have a huawei smartphone you don't even need to have a laptop with you you can just tap your huawei smartphone here and you'll connect to huawei's emui desktop then you can do work on this monitor with your phone or if you have a keyboard that would be even better so anyway that's about it for this first look unboxing hands-on of the huawei mate view so if you're interested in more content like this please consider subscribing to my channel or follow me on instagram at ben's gadget reviews that's it for now thanks for watching a small demonstration will now take place welcome to what gear reviews tech reviews coming to you from rainy old england today i want to give you guys an easy way to update your hms devices to harmony os early and it will only work with certain devices but i'm going to show you how to identify those and you really must follow the steps in this video for it to work number one make sure you subscribe okay you don't need to do that but one thing i will say full disclaimer if you do decide to try this method you do so at your own risk although it's coming straight from huawei so it should be all good you ready let's go so if you have a chinese device like this one you'll have an app called my huawei this will open up you can then select the china server if you've got an english huawei device like this the p40 what you'll need to do is download the my huawei app and i will leave a link to the apk below this video so you guys can download it from my website one thing you must do when you open the my huawei app is the first time you log in it will ask you to choose a region make sure you choose china so once you get to this screen my best advice to you guys to make sure you don't make any mistakes is get another phone like this and open google translate what you can then do here at the top of google translate is select chinese to english and you can use your camera to actually look at the screen and instantly translate everything just on screen this is what i did i spent ages doing this and you'll see there that left box is actually uh early access beta so translate and it says try it now so you can actually do that here on the devices and the reason i'm showing you on two devices is because actually this one this model here i looked at the model information it's not actually in the list of devices so i can't update this one just yet but there's a way to find out if your device is compatible with the early beta and i'll show you how to find out now so basically same thing i did here with the translate open the camera looked at all of this stuff to make sure i knew what was going on on each page so what you want to do here for example uh is you can see here mate 40 p40 mate 30 you can see the same thing here so here mate x2 of course click that this is a load of information that you should really read but the important bit on this page is the model number so if we do the same thing here this is the p45 g if we go in there you'll see as we scroll down these are the compatible devices so if your device doesn't appear in this list you won't be able to use the beta right now one way to find out if your device is in this list is actually go into your settings go to about phone and here you'll be able to see the actual model number so you can see mine is els nx9 again use your google translate to look at all of these pages read through at the bottom you'll see these continue buttons you go to those more information that you need to read through about the beta agree to those make sure you scroll all the way to the bottom and then this is the last page so this is the most important one this is where it will tell you to check if your device is compatible and it'll also tell you how the update will work so once you click this what will happen on the device that is compatible is you'll get the download if you click on one that isn't compatible you'll see it does absolutely nothing there we go it's installing the update here on the mate x2 unfortunately we've got to wait for the p40 pro and there we have it guys harmony os here ready to download 2.0.0 ready to go we hit download and install and as you can see the update package will be deleted automatically after the update is complete harmony os is a new paradigm smart operating system that's designed to ease and enrich your life facilitating seamless coordination between your devices whilst bolstering privacy and security across the board it's a versatile all scenario intelligence built to excel wherever life takes you that sounds pretty promising and a couple of things i do know about harmony os is it's still kind of piggybacks on android but essentially there's a part of the software that requires very little ram to run so essentially all of your devices whether it's smart scales smart phones smart watches smart microwaves they can all have this part of the code so that they can all work seamlessly together more so than we've ever seen before with huawei devices so it could be a game changer essentially what we are building an ecosystem to make your life easier if you buy into that ecosystem with all those compatible products and there's a bunch of third-party manufacturers that are going to be on board with this as well so it's not going to be just huawei devices that will have this bit of code the harmony os there'll be lots of devices going forward so let's just check that that will work properly if we go into settings go to about and you can see we are now officially on harmony os this is the mate x2 this is one of the first devices that it rolled out to all of the other ones will be updated shortly as well the proper way so if this method didn't work for you don't be discouraged you will get the update soon and i'm thinking about doing a more in-depth review on the actual operating system itself in the future once i've had some time to test it out so make sure you subscribe turn on your notifications for that i appreciate you guys for watching this one and i'll see you in the next one don't be late the rest is quite similar really where it is hi welcome to this week's episode of cold fusion last week we had a look at quibby the netflix for mobile it had a-list celebrities and two billion dollars of funding but failed in just six months today we'll be turning to the ever brewing story of huawei vs the united states huawei currently the world's largest smartphone manufacturer was the first high-profile company to be caught in the center of a feud between two competing world powers the united states of america and china after the huawei crackdown it was tick tock and wechat that came under fire it's all extraordinary when you think about it so what are both sides of the story what does this mean for huawei who wins and who loses and how did this all happen in the first place and what's the latest in the two years since the ban began let's take a look you are watching toll fusion tv [Music] so who are huawei we've already done an episode on their massive size and exactly what they do but here's an outline for those who missed it the company was founded in 1987 by ren thing fee a member of the chinese people's liberation army after his retirement he would start the huawei company initially focused on manufacturing phone switches huawei has since expanded its business to include building telecommunications networks communication equipment and consumer devices from data storage to networks and carrier software to pcs vr wearables smart speakers wi-fi routers usb modems and much more they do a lot huawei has deployed its products and services in more than 170 countries and has 21 foreign r d institutes internationally including countries like the united states canada and the uk huawei overtook ericsson in 2012 to become the world's largest telecommunications equipment manufacturer though to most people the company is most known for their smartphones as of q2 2020 they overtook samsung to become the number one smartphone maker selling 56 million units compared to samsung's 54 million in short they're a huge company but then suddenly seemingly out of nowhere in 2018 they were banned by the us government the company had an annual revenue of 120 billion us dollars last year so this ban is a big deal to understand why this happened we first must understand the bigger picture of the relations between china and the us until the 1970s china's economy was under communist control by the government it was isolated and closed from other economies but throughout the 1970s they opened up and in 2000 u.s president bill clinton signed the u.s china relations act of 2000. this agreement paved the way for china to join the world trade organization just a year later the idea was that trade with china would benefit american interests this agreement exchanges membership rights for china and the wto for economic opportunities for america in china for american businesses and american workers without the tariffs and technology transfer requirements and production and china requirements and other requirements which have limited our ability to benefit from their market for too long almost immediately chinese products flooded into the u.s and by the mid-2000s americans began to notice that everything was made in china the fact of the matter was that america was starting to build a reliance on china anything from toys to laptops electronic components and appliances it was now much more cost effective and cheaper for american companies to manufacture these goods in china and sell them back to the united states in 2006 china surpassed mexico as the biggest trade partner to the united states after canada all of this trade with america the biggest consumers on the planet was a huge boost to the chinese economy in the second quarter of 2010 china surpassed japan as the world's second largest economy in 2015 the chinese government unveiled its plans to become the most powerful economic empire by 2025. in this plan they wanted their currency the yuan to be more powerful than the us dollar one aspect of the plan was to pivot private companies to shift their goals towards the government's vision the americans were now nervous the plan was cited as a quote real existential threat to u.s technological leadership end quote by an american think tank in 2018 a trade war between the united states of america and china soon exploded huawei being such a big company was quickly caught in the middle we are being taken advantage of okay and i don't like it and i haven't liked it for many years and i told that to president xi i said how did this ever happen we're down 507 billion dollars in trade deficits how did it happen and they told me nobody ever complained there was never anybody to talk to in the united states so now that we know the driving factors that made this situation reach a boiling point what was the actual ban the united states accused huawei products of spying for the chinese government by using backdoors it was claimed that this behavior would be consistent with chinese laws that required companies to cooperate with state intelligence when needed huawei emphatically denied these claims and said the chinese government never asked them to have backdoors and if asked in the future they would refuse to comply and mr ren you talk a lot about the distance between huawei and the chinese government but what we've seen publicly is senior officials in the government talking at times on huawei's behalf is that useful to the company or do you find that a distraction first it's understandable that government leaders would take pride in the great companies of their country second huawei is being stuck in an extremely difficult situation the us is launching intense attacks against us if the u.s government speaks ill of huawei why couldn't the chinese government speak in our favor that creates a kind of balance in the past no one spoke up for us in 2018 the united states passed a bill that stopped the federal government from doing business with huawei and other chinese vendors due to security concerns but even to date no solid evidence has been brought forward to substantiate these concerns it could be a matter of the evidence being withheld for national security reasons or the simple fact that the evidence doesn't exist right now this is anyone's guess despite this u.s companies had to stop using huawei components in cell networks and current systems must remove any huawei components america encouraged its allies to do the same things quickly escalated when the chinese government threatened economic retaliation against countries that followed the us ban in 2019 huawei filed a lawsuit against the u.s government they cited that the ban was unconstitutional because there was no due process or a chance of rebuttal from huawei the ban divided u.s allies politically australia britain canada and new zealand semi-banned huawei but germany italy and much of europe haven't the german and british intelligence agencies have pushed back on the us allegations stating that they've found no evidence at first it seemed like the us was going to look foolish stephanie richard ceo of the mobile network orange stated that the claims of backdoor spying were like the weapons of mass destruction lie told during the iraq war however in july of 2020 the uk government backflipped and joined the band for their 5g equipment the reason this is an important moment is because some will say this is a moment where the uk is asserting itself as an agile independent political and economic power others will say they're being a bit like a pinball buffeted between the big powers the us and china which are engaged as frankly in a full-scale economic cold war and the uk is caught in the crossfire india would soon join following their northern border conflict with china france also recently stated that they would favor european companies for their 5g network in february of 2020 things escalated again the us department of justice charged huawei with racketeering and conspiring to steal trade secrets from six us companies there was some precedent though prior to this in 2014 huawei was accused of various instances of intellectual property theft against parties such as cisco systems and t-mobile us a t-mobile lawsuit claimed that two huawei usa employees spied on a smartphone testing robot in a lab on a visit to the lab the employees photographed the robot and stole one of its fingertips huawei did admit wrongdoing by the two huawei usa employees and fired them the most brutal part of the ban for huawei was the restrictions on business partners essentially american companies must stop supplying huawei with key components and technologies some of these entities include google arm the taiwanese chipset maker tsmc and mediatek so what does this mean well google has to drop support for huawei phones no google maps gmail or any google apps unfortunately for huawei no google apps means that it's going to be very unattractive to international buyers how important do you think things like google maps youtube all those applications are and they're very very important to be able to have access to them on your phone on the move so if they didn't offer that it would put me off using the phone completely designs from the company arm are used in huawei chips and tsmc manufactures the chips both are not us companies but the us has pressured them to stop support and stop manufacturing in september of 2020 huawei lost access to samsung and lg suppliers because the display driver ship had us technology samsung ram is even off the table it's estimated that huawei would lose 30 billion in revenue in the next two years following june 2019 [Music] so what are they going to do in the consumer market huawei is going to create their own app store and entire operating system they actually already have and it's called harmony os it can run on anything from cars and watches to smartphones and tvs the software will be running on huawei smartphones in december of 2020. interestingly the software can share resources from connected devices for example displaying an image and sound through a huawei tv while using the camera and microphone of a huawei phone they also plan to attract developers by bringing on board and promoting regional app makers that would otherwise have to fight to get market share in a flooded market harmony os is expected to run some android apps according to huawei their os is more flexible than android and 60 faster they claim that one line of harmony os code can do a hundred lines of android code i sat down with someone from huawei to explain more about their new operating system the company also plans to grow out a more robust network of partnerships around the world countries like japan and russia they're also currently working out a deal with qualcomm though r d may be focused towards local chinese chip manufacturing technology despite the sanctions huawei has launched the ninuan project and has struck new chip supply deals [Music] okay so we're almost at the end of the video but let's try and distill this from both points of view from america's point of view the general view is that china has their fingertips deep into huawei and that having any huawei technology in the nation is a big risk to national security not to mention the risk of having ips stolen for america it's mainly a question of trust china's rise and the geopolitical landscape of u.s china relations over the past decade may contribute to this view we convinced many countries not to use huawei because we think it's an unsafe security risk it's a big security risk we cannot ensure the defense of the west if our allies grow dependent on the east for the benefit of a few corporations you cannot sell the privacy of the the people of your country down the river from huawei's point of view i spoke to some people within huawei and in their view the real threat is the prison project started in 2007 the prison project was implemented by the us government to collect internet communications from companies that now include google facebook apple and microsoft [Music] huawei still asserts that there's been no evidence of spying in over 170 countries despite many the general view from huawei is that it's being used as a pawn to put pressure on china management in huawei claims that the us government persecutes it because huawei's expansion can affect american business interests attorney general william barr has been quoted as saying that the us needs to ban huawei to maintain its tech dominance it's all a big ploy to keep the rising china at bay to them it all seems unfair and unwarranted over the past century which countries and companies have made the us scare the us hasn't been scared of anyone or anything though for such a powerful country to be scared of a small company like us some other countries are saying your products are so good that the us government is scared we won't test your products we'll buy them directly that's why some deep pocketed countries with rich oil reserves are buying from us they are buying our products in large quantities as the us government is advertising for us in this there's going to be some unintended consequences as huawei breaks up from its u.s suppliers the suppliers will lose money in 2018 u.s companies earned around 11 billion dollars from huawei in addition 5g systems may end up being more expensive and ripping out existing huawei systems will cost money in the uk this is set to cost 7 billion pounds in addition america may be seen as a less secure place to do business than it previously was they had a virtually untarnished record of free trade in general any company that wanted to do trade in america could along with the more recent tick tock ban this pristine image is beginning to be altered even the risk fire foundation the company that provides open source software standards for the chips that power smartphones has moved from the us to switzerland due to concerns about stricter u.s regulation this all isn't to mention further escalation china may retaliate by stopping american companies from doing business with them so in the end who wins so far it seems like no one huawei will be battered from this experience but if they can achieve more robust partnerships they'll survive the us may have lost some credibility with their european allies and may be perceived as a less stable place for companies to invest but back to huawei the main issue for them is trust and that's a question of human psychology something that's becoming a little unpredictable in modern times though when you really do take this entire situation as a whole the real winner might be companies like samsung they don't really have any tyres to either side and may see some benefit in the end only time will tell so what do you guys think which side do you think is right do you take huawei side and think the us is scared of china rising or do you take the us aside and think that huawei is a front for china spying let me know in the comment section below in next week's episode we'll be taking a look at apple's new m1 chip and what this means for the bigger picture of the computing industry as a whole as it turns out this might not just be more marketing hype from apple and they could be on track to doing something special anyway that's about it from me thanks for watching don't forget to follow me on instagram and twitter and as a side point the standard cold fusion merch is still available if

much money can also come and Mahima so much of the ability to clean a little target bye-bye hey everybody i hope you guys are all healthy and safe so this is the huawei mate pad pro 2021 so the maypad is huawei's series of tablets there have been several of these in the past but this one is special because it runs on harmony os this is in fact the very first huawei mobile computing device to run on harmony os so that means this is our very first look at harmony os and there's a lot to like is the ui is very nice there's a lot of new special features smart features that you don't get on any other android or ipad tablets out there and then also if you own other huawei devices you just get complete symmetry across all your huawei devices now but i do have to rain on huawei's marketing parade a little bit in that some people at huawei have been claiming this is a completely new operating system built from the ground up without a single line of code from android that is just not true there have been very technically savvy people who have dug into the system code with harmony os and found very similar codes of android and also just the fact that most android apps including instagram will run perfectly fine on harmony os as is without like any sort of like emulator so that means as much as while i don't want to admit it harmony os is still kinda a version of android but it's okay because due to the us government's sanctions bullying of huawei huawei's has been unable to use google mobile services so it's approach now it's to build a so-called new operating system so that people will go in without thinking oh it's android so i have to be able to use google right it kind of frees you from the expectations from expecting android or google on this device and yes this tablet cannot run gms google mobile services so that means if you install the youtube app on the map pro it will not run but while not having gms on a smartphone has been a huge huge hassle and a deal breaker for a lot of people but i would argue that on a tablet not having gms isn't that big of a deal because you use a tablet like you use a computer anyway and if you're using a dell computer do you have google apps in that out of the box do you have a youtube app on your dell xps 13 you don't so not having gms on this it's actually pretty okay i'll explain more later [Music] okay before i continue on about why not having gms on this is not that big a deal let's go over the hardware so you have a 12.6 inch oled display with a resolution of 2560 by 1600 so it's a very sharp and vibrant screen unfortunately this is only a 60 hertz panel but again on a tablet i'd argue it's not that big a deal because you use a tablet for two real things light productivity like writing articles typing words and watching videos watching movies and for both of these you don't need 120 or 90 hertz refresh rate now device is really thin and light it weighs 609 grams which is about 1.3 pounds for americans and it measures just 6.7 millimeters in thickness so inside is a kirin 9000e so this is a 5 nanometer soc the same one used in huawei's mate 40 pro there's 8 gigs of ram and either 126 or 256 gigs of ufs 3.1 storage you have a triple camera system here consisting of a 13 megapixel main camera an 8 megapixel ultra wide and a 3d tof sensor around the front you have an 8 megapixel selfie camera and the good news is it's located in the middle top part of the tablet inside the tablet is a 10 050 million battery and including with the package is a 40 watt charging brick and this tablet also supports wireless charging 27 watt wireless charging and it can reverse charge other devices too now just like apple's ipad the mapat pro really it's better used with companion accessories so this includes a pencil which huawei calls the m pencil this sticks onto the tablet just like so and there's a keyboard folio case so unfortunately all these are sold separately and huawei has not announced official pricing but basically if you get this whole kit tablet keyboard case and m pencil it's going to run you over 1 100 us dollars so keyboard on this thing as you can see it's pretty generously spaced there's quite a lot of space between each keys so that makes for an easier typing experience you're not going to actually press different keys and there's actually quite a lot of travel around one millimeter there's two propping angles for the tablet so you can either have like this or this and then when you fold it up the case offers all-around protection and it still keeps the device relatively thin and light so this 12.6 inch screens the largest we've had in a huawei tablet yet which makes it great for videos and you're going to want to watch videos on this thing because this tablet has eight speakers four on each side and they're really damn loud they're tuned by harman kardon [Music] and yes you might have noticed i am indeed running youtube on this right now i'm just running youtube off the web browser and that explains why i don't think the lack of gms on harmony os is that big of a deal because you use this tablet like you use a windows laptop anyway and on windows laptop if you want to watch youtube what do you do you don't have a youtube app right you just go on youtube.com and likewise if you want to go on google maps on a dell or microsoft laptop what do you do there's no google maps on the app right you go on google maps via web browser and it works perfectly fine on a web browser on the map pro now if you're thinking what if i want to install third-party apps like instagram facebook netflix all that well huawei has designed a very small way for you to do that it's called pedal search and there's actually a search bar right here so you just jump into pedal search let's say i want to install facebook just type facebook and it'll show you a list of ways you can install facebook and these are trustworthy sources for example you can download facebook from apk period which is definitely a trusted third-party apk hosting site but you can also download from the official website if it's available so now it'll take me directly to the facebook site to download the app just tap download and just like that install and then i have facebook on a map pro and this works for many apps now obviously not every app is going to be available like this but i was able to get netflix facebook instagram twitter on it with no problem and netflix everything runs perfectly fine okay now let's take a look at harmony os as you can see harmony os unfortunately takes a lot of inspiration from ipad os for example we swipe from the corner to bring down this control center toggle and then you swipe from the middle to bring down your notification shade and also you have this dock down here that looks very very similar to the ipad os stock but huawei has added some of its own clever touches too for example i really like that you can swipe up on certain apps and it will immediately jump into the widget so that offers you a quick look at your widget and then if you tap in you can immediately pin that widget to your home screen likewise for notepad if you swipe over the notepad you can see your latest notes and now they have a widget here you can do that with most apps i haven't set up email yet but if i have set up email i can swipe up and probably get a look at my last two or three emails right here and we use the m pencil and hover over a specific app in the doc you'll see a preview of what you just opened recently so on instagram i can see my last post on chrome i can see my last tab on photo i can see the last photo that i uploaded okay so let's take a look at this m pencil it's a pretty clean minimal design actually looks like a pen more than a pencil there's a flat side right here so then when you're when you have it on the table it won't roll off the table if you double tap on the pen then it would switch to eraser double tap again it will jump back to pencil and latency it's pretty good la huawei has designed some clever features with the m pencil too one of these is free shape so for example i'm trying to draw a square it's pretty hard to draw a perfect square or perfect triangle when you're using freehand right or a perfect circle huawei has designed this little clever software trick that if you just hold the pencil at the end of the stroke it will then register and give you the perfect shape that you want so now you see this triangle is perfect i'm going to draw a square i'm going to hold still and then you see i have a perfect square that's not all this also works if you want to build a chart or graph now it gets in a rectangle to online and then another line now i have myself a little graph right and then if i write on this just watch this if i write too long the graph will adjust itself so how are you doing you see it like it just decides to fit whatever i'm writing so n w o for life man that's pretty damn clever but that's not all my favorite smart feature of the huawei and pencil is probably this free script so i can just write on this adjust address bar x d a and it'll show up exterior and then you see there's a necessary space right there right i can just draw a line and it'll bring xda together and if i want to get rid of it i just scribble and i'll get rid of it and i'll write another one go face book sucks and i can highlight the text by drawing a line through it and it'll highlight the text that i can copy and paste it easily if i want to get rid of you know sucks that now as i mentioned earlier harmony os allows seamless connectivity across all your huawei devices so i have a huawei monitor i can wirelessly connect this map pro to that monitor i can output to that display and we look at this keyboard down here there's a little nfc icon right here right this allows one touch connectivity between a huawei smartphone i have the huawei mix 2 here and the huawei and maypad pro so i just have to tap my phone on it and i already feel the vibration and it's asking if i want to connect i say yes and now see now my x2 screen is showing on the map pro i see it's pretty damn smart so yeah this is the huawei mate pad pro in a nutshell so what i think of the tablet overall i think the tablet's hardware is top-notch as we can expect from a huawei product like the oled screen is so nice and you pump out deeper black stand on even this ipad the much hyped mini led screen on ipad pro like you know if you saw my review of this i said this is the best screen in an ipad but it is still not as good as an older panel so if you look at instagram here side by side colors just pop a little bit more and look a little bit more bold and vibrant on the map pro solar panel than on the ipad pro's mini led screen i'm also a big fan of the keyboard this is a very comfortable type of experience and the m pencil the m pencil is really fun to play with however i'm disappointed with harmony os in two areas i'm disappointed that the overall aesthetics of the home screen looks just like ipad os i feel like if you're a chinese company you can't give western media any excuses to make fun of you so if i'm designing for harmony os for the maypad pro i would make the ui look as different from the ipad os as possible because if you make something that looks similar us websites are just gonna start poking fun and why give them ammo so i'm disappointed in that and i'm also disappointed at some huawei marketing people for claiming harmony os is a completely new operating system built from the ground up when that is not true but like i said it's kind of necessary because the us government is bullying huawei so much it's good for huawei to try to pay its own way and free itself at least you know a name from something that people associate with google so now when you come into harmony os maybe you won't expect oh where's google maps there should be google maps on this thing right as for pricing huawei has not announced official pricing but like i said this tablet by itself is around 700 800 euro and if you add the keyboard and then pencil it's gonna go over 1000 euro go over which is about one thousand one hundred one thousand two in the us dollars now as for if this is worth it or not it's up to you if you're someone who just want every single app to work like you really wanna just run the youtube app natively then just get an ipad or get the samsung galaxy tab s7 and you'll have a lot less hassles if you just get those two machines however if you respect huawei's hardware craftsmanship if you want to support huawei or if you just own a huawei smartphone and you want something that connects seamlessly the huawei map pro it's worth looking at like i said tip top hardware and the software is more than usable as a productivity and multimedia consumption machine that's about it for this review of the huawei matepad pro 2021 if you're interested in more content like this please consider subscribing to my channel or follow me on instagram at ben's gadget reviews i post a lot of photo samples and cop

start at the going in but first let's start at the beginning quick disclaimer huawei beginning quick disclaimer huawei reached out to sponsor this video but as reached out to sponsor this video but as always always all views are my own both good and bad all views are my own both good and bad so the change in design so the change in design is subtle on the pro but there's no is subtle on the pro but

customize your watch enough options to customize your watch to your preference and my personal to your preference and my personal favorite is this black taiwan favorite is this black taiwan because again the next james bond because again the next james bond no still not okay one cool feature if no still not okay one cool feature if you do decide to spice up your watch you do decide to spice up your watch face a little bit face a little bit outside of the sort of built-in custom outside of the sort of built-in custom watch faces that you can choose from watch faces that you can choose from

to then go you decide whether you want to then go to your phone to respond to your phone to respond and that leads me back to software and and that leads me back to software and hardware hardware and my original point of the start how and my original point of the start how does the third edition live up to the does the third edition live up to the first two first two and should you buy it now like with all and should you buy it now like with all huawei gt2 watch devices it is running huawei gt2 watch devices it is running with huawei's with huawei's lite os it's not new but it definitely lite os it's not new but it definitely feels like it's been optimized feels like it's been optimized marginally better on the pro marginally better on the pro than the previous in the series than the previous in the series certainly not night and day but it just certainly not night and day but it just feels that little bit slightly smoother feels that little bit slightly smoother but but that might just be me but with the four that might just be me but with the four gigabytes of storage and 32 megabytes of gigabytes of storage and 32 megabytes of ram ram we're pretty much looking at the same we're pretty much looking at the same internals internals as the other two in the series so if you as the other two in the series so if you already have a gt2 or gt2e already have a gt2 or gt2e it's a little bit harder for me to it's a little bit harder for me to recommend because it's not recommend because it's not too much different internally with the too much different internally with the pro also with the turn of the year pro also with the turn of the year almost upon us and rumors of almost upon us and rumors of brand new exciting software and hardware brand new exciting software and hardware from huawei from huawei are there gonna be big leaps next year are there gonna be big leaps next year from them in a few months time from them in a few months time obviously time will tell we don't know obviously time will tell we don't know for sure but it is again something to for sure but it is again something to consider do you bite the bullet now and consider do you bite the bullet now and buy a buy a pretty brilliant watch or do you wait a pretty brilliant watch or do you wait a few months few months maybe something is drastically different maybe something is drastically different again who knows with all that being said again who knows with all that being said if you currently don't own one of the if you currently don't own one of the previous previous gt2 watches or you're just simply a gt2 watches or you're just simply a sucker for that brand new premium sucker for that brand new premium looking design looking design and i can't blame you on that one it and i can't blame you on that one it really is a butte then this is by far really is a butte then this is by far the most complete and my favorite huawei the most complete and my favorite huawei watch going

[Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] thanks for watching don't forget to subscribe and share this video see you in the next video THIS is the Huawei Mate X2! It is by far the most special foldable phone
on the market right now. And that’s because 1. It has the best hardware in a foldable, and
2. It is close to impossible to get. You cannot buy it in the UK yet, or in Europe,
or in the US. You can only buy it in China at the moment
and the stock is incredibly limited. In fact – this phone is so hard to get that
even our review unit is the only one in the UK. And, we only have for 2 and a half days, after
which we do have to send it back, as there’s literally a queue of reviewers waiting to
get their hands on it. So, without any further ado, here is how it
compares to the Galaxy Z Fold 2 – the current foldable champion! My foldable smartphone journey started with
the Fold 1 in April 2020, after which I got the Z Fold 2 as soon as it came out in September
2020. I’ve used each as my main android phone,
alongside my iPhone. And the Fold 2 was for me the perfect foldable
phone, as it fixed all of the complaints that I had with the Fold 1, such as the small external
display, the massive notch, the overall durability AND also added some unexpected features, such
as the new hinge that you could stop at any point you wanted. In fact, the Z Fold 2 was so good that 2 of
my team members, Harry and Josh both got one as well! So we actually have 4 Z Fold 2’s in the
office, as we have another one, just for shots. But it turns out that this new foldable from
Huawei, tops even the Z Fold 2…at least when it comes to the hardware. Right off the bat, the Mate X2 fully changes
the design philosophy of Huawei’s Mate X and Mate Xs, which both used a single foldable
display that folded on the onside and instead, it adopts Samsung’s idea of having a foldable
display that folds on the inside, and then a regular display on the outside. This is so that the inner display always stays
protected, which is a great decision for foldables, as Huawei also had issues where the Mate X
broke, because of how easily the foldable display could get damaged, by always being
exposed. So if they are so similar now, how does the
Mate X2 improve over the Z Fold 2’s hardware? First, the outer display is fully usable as
a regular smartphone. You see, with the Z Fold 2, even-though the
outer display has been significantly improved over the Fold 1’s, by Samsung making it
bigger and therefore more usable, it still suffers from the very narrow aspect ratio. It is very difficult to type on and the fact
that it is still very tall, makes it very difficult for me to use in one hand, as I
constantly have to move my hand up, to be able to reach the top of it. The Mate X2 fixes that by using a large 6.45”
display, which has a more conventional aspect ratio compared to the Z Fold 2’s. And this is also a 90Hz display, rather than
it being a 60Hz panel, like on the Z Fold 2. In fact, this display is so good that I can
pretty much do everything on it, without the need to open it up. Whereas with the Z Fold 2, I only use the
outer display probably about 20% of the time, with the remaining 80% going to the inner
display. Second, we have the camera. The Z Fold 2 uses the same main and ultra-wide
modules as the Galaxy S20. Not the S20 Ultra, but the regular S20, while
the telephoto is the same as on the S10. And I’m not saying that the camera is bad
or anything, as the main sensor captures a lot of light with its large 1.8µm pixels,
but the fact that we don’t have anything more than 2x zoom is a bit disappointing,
when other flagships have crazy numbers like 5x or 10x optical. Well, the Mate X2 fixes that by using a true
flashship camera. Its main sensor is a 50MP sensor, 1/1.28”
in size, with 4:1 pixel binning, as opposed to the smaller 12MP 1/1.76 inch sensor on
the Z Fold 2. You can take a look at a few samples from
the main camera module right here and see how they compare. The telephoto module is vastly superior on
the Mate X2. As we not only have 1, but 2 of them. The 1st one is a 12MP 3x optical zoom module,
which already gives you more zoom range than the single 2x module on the Z Fold 2 and then
the 2nd one is an 8MP 10X optical zoom module which uses a periscope lens to achieve an
incredible level of zoom, that just blows the Z Fold 2’s zoom out of the water. And then we have the ultra wide module which
is a 12MP f/2.2 module on the Z Fold 2 vs a 16MP f/2.2 module on the Mate X2. Not a massive difference here. Moving on to the 3rd thing that the Mate X
2 does better than the Z Fold 2 - the overall thickness. You cannot argue with the fact that the Z
Fold 2 is very thick and feels like a brick in your pocket. It has this sloped design where the body gets
thicker, the closer you get to the hinge. And that’s because you cannot fold a display
flat, as it would break if you did that. Instead, Samsung has this gap that keeps the
display slightly open, even when closed, giving it a thickness of 16.8mm at its thickest point
and 6.9mm at its thinnest. When it is fully open, it does indeed feel
very thin. Not so much when closed. However, Huawei not only made the Mate X2
noticeably thinner, at just 14.7mm when closed, but they also fixed the sloped design of the
Z Fold 2, by closing almost perfectly flat. But how did they manage to do that? If you look closely when closing the display,
you can see how the display still remains curved on the inside, but then the body of
the phone became thinner, in order for it to be able to close flat. It’s pretty genius how they designed this! And I gotta say, just holding it in my hand,
the Mate X2 feels SO MUCH BETTER than the Z Fold 2. It feels way more usable and similar to using
an S21 Ultra with a case, rather than an actual foldable phone. When unfolded, it does feel pretty thick on
one side and super thin on the other, as opposed to the Z Fold 2 which feels more symmetrical,
which kinda reminds me of when I was using the Z Fold 2 with a case on. But overall, the Mate X feels in hand how
I would want the Z Fold 3 to feel. Speaking of changes that the Z Fold 3 needs
to make. The crease! On the Z Fold 2, it is noticeable, although
you will quickly forget about it after just a few minutes of use, but on the Mate X2,
Huawei has somehow managed to pretty much remove it entirely – to the point where
you cannot see it and you can only barely feel it. And on top of that, there are SO many things
that the Mate X 2 does better. For example, it comes with a free case in
the box, which also includes a kickstand, whereas with the Z Fold 2, you have to buy
that separately. It also comes with a super fast 66W charger
in the box, as opposed to the 25W charger that the Z Fold 2 comes with. We also get advanced face scanning tech on
the front, similar to what we have on the iPhone, which is something that the Z fold
2 lacks. And we also get an IR blaster! When was the last time we had this in a phone? So now that we took a look at how the Mate
X 2 improves over the Z Fold 2, let’s take a look at some of the things that the Z Fold
2 does better. The first one being the hinge that you can
stop at any point you want, so you can use it for watching videos and some apps would
even take advantage of this. The Mate X2 closes shut immediately, and it
doesn’t feel as satisfying to open, as the Z Fold 2 does. Not to mention that we do not have a camera
on the internal display at all, which really sucks when you want to do a video call. Speaking of the internal display, the Mate
X only has a 90Hz refresh rate, compared to the 120Hz on the Fold 2. The bezels surrounding the display are ever
so slightly thicker and the Z Fold 2 is also more affordable at £1600 in the UK, vs around
£2000 for the Mate X2. But then again you cannot actually buy the
Mate X2 in the UK yet, or even outside of China, so for most people this is not an option. And obviously, since this is a Huawei phone,
Google services are also not an option either. Huawei has added tools such as Petal search
and more ways to install APKs. So if you really want to get Google stuff
and your regular apps, for the most part, you can. It’s just that it’s way more hassle to
do so, since there is no PlayStore and getting updates requires more steps to, reason why
for anyone outside of China, I just cannot recommend this phone. BUT for anyone in China, this is by far the
best foldable you can get and if you really are a tinkerer and you 
want to get this imported from China and you don’t mind the hassle of getting your apps
on, I think it is an absolutely amazing piece of hardware! [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] do do [Music] [Music] you you consumers around globe have been looking forward to our spring flagship [Music] me [Music] oh [Music] i'm speaking of course about the huawei p50 series that is supposed to be launched in this spring it is a sheer beauty with an ultra thin and lightweight design and an iconic design language it lifts mobile photography to a new level four reasons you are aware of a launch date has not yet been set but we are trying to figure out how to make this great product available to you speaking of wild speculation oh man i'm crushing i'm crushing is this a speculation segways yeah because this is a rumor okay okay speaking of speaking of wild speculation uh we've got a huawei p50 rumor slash image slash leak from ice universe i just like i just opened it and the top comment is huge just saying lol in all caps it is a it is an image i'm just going to paint a visual picture for you so imagine the back of the phone right on the back of the phone somewhere in the top left you have your camera bump now i want you to look at the back of your phone and divide it into quadrants i have a really good way to describe this i feel like i'm just going to say if you can picture the the back of your phone into quadrants top left top right bottom left bottom right picture the entire top left binoculars two huge circles looking at you this looks almost looks like to me um do you know how john rettinger does those thumbnails where he's focusing on cameras on smartphones where it's the smartphone back and he he dislocates basically the camera bump and zooms it up this looks like uh maybe like the iphone 10s which had the vertical two camera and then john renders zooming it out and just slapping it back on the back of the phone but it's weird because it's it's got three cameras inside the top circle yeah and then another camera and a flash inside the bottom circle i assume the bottom one is like a large like periscope lens or some sort of large mod like that sharp phone that's probably that's rumored yeah you know that one with this just like one giant camera yeah so the fact that it's in a larger circle is purely aesthetic and they're just leaning into this circular aesthetic and so it just looks like binoculars on the back i think the best way to describe it is imagine a vertical two-camera system that's gigantic and then there's cameras that's just the bump the cameras are inside what you thought were the cameras because when i first saw this from the corner of my eye on your screen i thought i just had two gigantic cameras on the back that would be and i don't know if that would be better or worse i don't think the phone is just too bad i don't think the phone's thick enough for cameras to be that actually huge i think this is just an aesthetic yeah yeah it's just a look it's a look it's a look man huawei if this is actually the way the p50 looks be prepared for the memes because you know some companies do things for the memes get prepared it looks like wally that's another good one oh if you just scroll down the comments yeah the comments are there's more stove top ones like i highly recommend you scroll down and look at the means we'll link this in the show notes yeah this is great the same energy so turntables oh my god this is great sonic microwaves it's good i don't know it's dead mouse ears interesting i haven't said mouse ears that would be i feel like you could skin some cool things on this and use use that as inspiration on on top of it but like yeah it's just a weird look i don't know it also has a flash in between them it's great it's so i don't really get it i mean the the focus of the thing is the focus of so many of these new smartphones coming out is just the the cameras and the differentiation of the cameras and we already know xiaomi huawei they're not afraid of a big camera bump like they're not afraid of going absolutely nuts with how crazy the cameras look on the back of the phone whether or not their cameras are actually the best in the business debatable but they're not afraid to have crazy camera ball i still think if you're going crazy camera bump you go horizontal and you go as high up as possible so when it leans on the phone it's almost like a wedge like i kind of imagine the pixel six rumors which you know has that big like daft punk looking horizontal if that continued up to the top or was closer to the top edge i think that would be like perfect but this is just kind of crazy wobble yeah and it's gonna wobble a lot yeah what is up guys techrax here so in this video we're gonna be doing a drop test of three really cool phones that came out this year and I've got three clear cases guys I want to show you I'm gonna put each phone in one of these cases so if you can already guess guys this will be right here the iPhone 11 pro which I've got right here in my hands perfectly working beautiful works this case right here belongs to the Galaxy Note 10 one of those in there which I've got right here it is a little bit dirty here in the back but it does fully work here's the front and finally the huawei mate 30 Pro and this is going to go into this case right here as you guys can see here's the back of it fully works no cracks whatsoever this is actually a really beautiful color and a very beautiful phone has a great camera on it and all three phones are in their cases just the side note guys all these cases are very cheap there were six seven dollars silicone cases so will be interesting to see just based on all three of them they're very different - all three of them are different brands which one does better so let's drop them off and see what happens and we're at the spark guys I just want to show you how crazy this place looks like so it's about 13 stories I'm gonna drop three of the phones directly hopefully in to that hole right there pretty memorizing guys gotta say pretty sketchy - but here are the three phones iPhone 11 Pro Galaxy Note 10.1 so I'm gonna hold them like this and go straight down let's go ahead and do it in three two one there is the first phone fully cracked there's the second phone oh my goodness crazy but still recording so a final recap of these three phones guys and I gotta say right away footage was a little bit wonky with this video because where I was filming I actually don't know if I was allowed to film there at all it was this government building there were people around there were actually people walking around the stairs it was pretty sketchy so I wasn't able to film everything but what happened was the Galaxy Note 10 was the only phone that Ferrat fell at the very bottom and yet the weird thing is it remained inside its case and there's no cracks whatsoever so this phone literally looks perfectly fine the only visible damage on this phone that I can see is the scuffing right at the bottom right hand side of the corner of the phone I think might have been just the angle of the drop or something but the phone still works perfectly fine yes it does the iPhone 11 Pro actually stayed inside of its case the back looking completely fine no crack with the camera nothing on the back fully protected but the front fully damaged and as you guys can see it's tweaking out here a little bit major frame damage on top check this out phone is just fully coming apart here one more time here's the bottom of the device and the side screen is popping out and finally with the Huawei May 30 pro the phone actually cracked on both the front and the back the clear case actually flew out so I wasn't even able to find it I don't know where it landed but the phone was actually working perfectly fine for the first few hours I was able to power it on and mess around with the device but now as you guys can see you can just hear a little bit with the audio here as I press the power button but there's nothing showing on the display so this phone is a goner the camera surprisingly did not crack but the back did and the front so that's a wrap for this video guys as always I hope you guys enjoyed this thanks for watching and I'll see you guys in the next one peace out what's happening everyone my name is alex and welcome back in today's video i'm gonna show you how to install the google mobile services on your huawei or honor device once the installation process is done everything seems to work fine so that was the youtube app this is the google play store that one seems to work fine i'm not going to show you my emails chrome works fine and google maps works fine you're still not going to be able to use them google pay after you install the google mobile services and also you should check the video's description before you do anything i will post any updates in there and also a list of devices that are compatible with this installation method i didn't come up with this installation method so if you want to see the original video that was in spanish there will be a link in the video's description and with that being said let me turn the camera around and let me show you how to install the google mobile services on your huawei device all right so you have to start the installation process with a fresh factory reset keep in mind that when you do a factory reset everything that you have on your phone will be erased so first things first check the video's description and make sure that your phone is compatible with this installation method next you have to remove the sim card so the sim card has to be out of your device and for now you can be connected to wi-fi all right first things first you're gonna have to download the installation file and um to find the installation file and the link for that check the video's description so you're going to open the browser click next agree allow along and enter the link that you've seen in the video's description that link may change depending if the files are available or not but i will try to update the link as often as possible so everyone can download that so enter the link in the video's description so this is a google drive folder it's going to look something like this press on this once then press at the top here and you're going to have to press download anyway twice so once uh or once sometimes you have to press twice on it but button press download and just give it a couple of minutes till it's done downloading the file when that file is done downloading you can exit that go to files here here you're gonna go to categories internal storage download browser and this is the file that we just downloaded so hold this pressed for a second select more extract to and you can select the current directory and press ok and this is the file that you just um downloaded so here it's step one you're gonna go to backup you're gonna select huawei hold it press for a second select move select other location select internal storage press move here you're gonna select apply to all and merge and then you can go back and you can exit that next you're gonna turn off the wi-fi so go to wi-fi turn it off next we'll go to system and updates here you're gonna go to time and date and you're gonna deselect the first one so not set automatically and you're gonna change the date to uh 2018 or 2019 whatever you prefer go back and back next we're going to go to apps here at apps we'll click on apps once again select show system processes search for backup here you're gonna force stop it and you're gonna uninstall it that simple and you're gonna exit this and you can close everything running in the background next we'll go to files internal storage download browser our installation folder and we'll go back to step one and here we're gonna install these two apps so click on the first one select don't ask me again allow and install done and install the second one install done exit this and you can close everything running in the background next we'll go to settings once again we'll go to system and updates we'll go to backup and restore data backup next agree select the three dots at the top here restore from internal storage select the only one that shows up and restore and you're gonna have to enter this password right here press ok and done and of course you can exit this and close everything running in the background so now you're going to open the blue g app and a couple of things can happen you can get this screen and if you get this screen everything will work normally or you can get a different screen and that means that this doesn't work with your device and you probably have to downgrade the software on your device so i will try to leave some links in the video's description so i can show you how to downgrade the software on your device but if you get to this this works um fine so press activate and allow so just leave this like this and you can probably close it from the background so close everything running from the background next we're gonna go to settings at settings we are gonna turn on the wi-fi once again and then we're going to go to system and updates time and date and you're going to set the time to automatic once again you can exit this and you can close everything running in the background next we are going to open files once again internal storage download browser and our folder here and we're going to step number two and here we're going to install this app right here click install and click done and you can exit that and now you should find the app right here so now you can open this don't change anything go to account add google account sign in this will close do it again sign in and now you can enter your gmail account and password click next and enter your password click next agree and now you should be logged in and to check and make sure that you're logged in go open settings users and accounts and at google here you should see your account so you can exit this and close everything running in the background if you want to add a second account open this app once again and add the second account now so that's how you would add the second account next we're gonna open the g app we'll give it a second press on this and on this and let this um run in the background we'll open files we'll go to internal storage download browser and we're going to step 3 and we're going to install all these apps so number one number two number three number four number five number six and you can exit this next you're gonna open the play store but it's not gonna work but you just wanna see that your account is there so you can close this just close the play store and uh then you're gonna uninstall the micro g app so just uninstall this next we're gonna go back to files here we'll go to internal storage download browser and we'll go to stem number four and we're gonna install this so install it and give it a second we should then start getting notifications some pretty soon those error notifications so exit that go to settings here go all the way to user and accounts google and here uh turn on the sync for everything go back back back and we are getting the notifications now but the play store should be working now so you can probably see the play store is working so i'm going to turn on down the sound so you don't hear that anymore but um now we're basically getting all the notifications by the google play store is working all right so next we're gonna try getting rid of all those uh notifications that we're getting so we're gonna close all the apps running in the background we're gonna go to settings we'll go to apps we'll go to apps once again here we'll select show system processes search for google and we're gonna uninstall the google play services so first stop it and then uninstall it and you can exit this and close everything running in the background next we're gonna go back to files internal storage download browser and we'll go to step number five we'll install this give it a second press done exit this open the play store and make sure that it still works so it still works but we still get the the notifications the notification errors we'll close that everything is closed we'll get rid of those notifications and then we'll go to settings so here we're going to apps once again apps at the top show system processes search for google and we're going to google services framework here we are gonna go to storage clear cache clear data will for stop it you may have to do this a few times uninstall and we'll exit this we'll go back to files internal storage here we'll go to download browser and here we'll go to fix errors we'll install number one install done next we'll make sure that the play store is still working so it's still working next we'll go back to settings back to apps apps once again and search for google show system processes and we're gonna go to google play services and um you're gonna for stop it and you're gonna uninstall it then we'll exit this we'll go back to files and we're going to install our second app from here install and when this is done you're going to restart the phone so you're not gonna do anything else you'll just restart the phone so wait for it press done exit this and restart the device we'll press power off and then i'll start it again in a second we'll just give it a second so when the phone starts again we basically have to see if those notifications keep showing up and we do have a notification at the top there but the play store should be working fine so next we are going to go back for some devices they may actually work with all notifications now for some you may have to do this once again so go back to apps go back to apps show system process search for google here go to google framework services go to storage clear data clear cache and for stop it and uninstall it go back to our files here internal storage download browser fix errors and reinstall this we'll press done and let's restart the phone once again now that the phone is back on we'll have to check and see if those notifications come back so no notifications on showing up let's install the youtube app let's install chrome install chrome hotel some let's do gmail for account for uh for a try so the youtube app does seem to work normally i can access my account there chrome we're still waiting for chrome the gmail app is on and chrome should be on soon and chrome works so there you have it the google play services on the huawei p40 pro probably p40 pro plus the mate 30 and um so on so it takes a while it's a lot um based on a lot of luck for some it may work from the first try from some of you may you may have to do like this three or four times so it really depends on your luck but at least we get another um google mobile services uh installation method that works all right guys hopefully you enjoyed this video if you did like it don't forget to press that like button don't forget to subscribe and i'll see you guys in the next one thanks for watching okay welcome to what I would say is the camera comparison of the year I've got the three companies that I would say make the best smartphone cameras and these are pretty much their best models sir welcome to Lally p40 Pro Galaxy S 20 ultra vs. iPhone 11 prompt Macs students to get one thing straight the p40 Pro Strength is ready in photos but just before we get to that the company have made improvements to video to all three phones can record 4k video at 60 frames per second the Samsung can even do 8k but that comes with its own set of caveats and I wouldn't really recommend using it anyways when you're just filming standard video in the daytime but the main differentiator is really just the style that each company's opted for iPhone sticks closest to reality samsung takes that reality and adds a little bit of extra vibrance and hallways is just a little bit different gone are the days when Huawei just took the saturation slider and worked it up to max settings the p40 pros output if anything is actually the least saturated in a lot of cases it's similar to the iPhones but almost a little bit fainter and if you look at the bright areas you can see it does occasionally overexpose this brightness though may well be in part because of its huge camera sensor which lets a ton of light in and so when you're in the dark this potential weakness turns into a strength and it's pretty much a case of the darker you go the further behind the other to four so let's go really dark the kind of Darkness where Samsung's video is looking like a pot pourri of pixels and the iPhones well you can barely see anything I'm also going to drop the prices of each of these phones on screen right now just the UK price just to give you an idea of how they stack up relative to each other the p40 pro is also very snappy when focusing the phone has a new akhter phase detection autofocus system but to be honest the iPhone can keep up and can actually do so with a smoother focusing system Samsung's phone has improved since launch but I mean it's not great and here's some selfie video it's kind of amazing we've got smart phone for here that can take phenomenal video on their front cameras and what are the first things you might be able to tell is that always dialed up the audio quality on their phones and their AI noise reduction is now fantastic also in this of things that always improved you've got the fact that the company has really pushed the quality of its zoom and it's ultra light which you can see here but they've both comments like caveats for example while was using an ultra wide camera built specifically to take cinematic video then so the output looks great and really consistent with its main camera compare that to Samsung where the quality Falls and the phone kind of punches up the contrast to try and compensate the trade-off for huawei is that this ultra wide isn't really ultra wide okay the zoom cameras add an even more interesting layer of complexity to this because before we and Samsung are fantastic this right here is at six times magnification and if you take a look at the ducts here you can see that hallways even edges out Samsung's space zoom or if you one of those people you could just screw it and zoom in 15 times and it's cool that you can do that and still get well I wouldn't call it sharp video but a serviceable video the iPhone keeps it together but is noticeably less crisp than the other two but here's the twist you could argue that for most of the time you zoom you'll probably be zooming two to four times and in those cases you'll actually get better quality from the iPhone with the other two we're not quite magnified enough to activate their telephoto cameras so at this stage they're forced to just using digital zoom with their main cameras and it's not pretty also if you enjoyed this video a sub would be amazing now almost every clip you've seen so far was actually taken handheld so you don't need telling the stabilization is a plus on all three of these phones but what if you stopped moving well if you're filming a 4k resolution a gentle walk is fine it'll look good on all three but if we up the pace then the p40 and iPhones footage starts to fall apart there's just too much motion for them to handle if you lower that resolution to 1080p each phone improves but Samsung is king of stabilization I should say though that what Huawei wants you to do with video is use its ultra wide-angle camera that was built for situations like this so if you switched to that then even at 4k it does a pretty good job ok so just before I get to slow-motion I'm itching to address the elephant in the room photo quality and this is where Huawei shines you might well know that past phones from the company have had some let's say interesting color processing algorithms but it definitely feels like this has been tweaked to focus on natural shots with again as with video this slightly faded look on default settings one thing that becomes quite apparent here is the sheer size of the sensors on hallway and Samsung large sensors equals big depth of field or in other words crisp foregrounds and nicely blurred backgrounds you're almost taking photos that look like portrait mode shots without actually needing to use fake portrait mode if you actually do use portrait mode like here you can obviously have as much background blur as you want and I'd say iPhones have been the gold standard for portrait mode for a while and even though Huawei has made leaps and bounds that doesn't change here all phones take good quality ultra wide photos during the day at least but as with video quite apparent as Huawei's not so wide-angle Samsung and apples shots are just more dramatic zoom when taking photos is maybe the most interesting part of this comparison on paper you might think that who always got this one in the bag after all it has a 5 times optical zoom versus Samsung's four times but not quite Samsung zoom camera may have less magnification but it has a higher resolution so for photos when you start zooming in crazy numbers samsung has more room to crop inside its image the big question though for a lot of people is which one captures more detail the qua way has a 50 megapixel main camera Samsung has a 108 megapixel one and Apple 12 so if you take a max resolution shot on each and crop all the way in the result is about what it sounds like on paper but here's the thing almost all the time you won't be capturing max resolution photos they take time to process they suck up a ton of your storage and they have less dynamic range so by default all phones are set to a much lower resolution twelve point five megapixel on Huawei and twelve for the other two so in terms of general photo detail there really isn't that much in it but wait there's another twist a lot of the photos I take and I'm sure are the ones that you take they're not in ideal lighting conditions and as soon as you start moving away from daylight hallway steamrolls if we crop into this shot here there's an immediate difference in how much information is being captured if we go darker that trend is somewhat exaggerated again this is not using the night mode on the phones just Auto the only thing I would say about whoa is that it sometimes can slightly overcompensate on cool tones when shooting in low-light what about night mode then so each of these phones comes with a night mode that lets you hold them steady for a few seconds and capture more information and to give you an idea this is that same photo taken using night mode on all three back to normal and night modes you can probably tell the iPhone sees the biggest immediate gain from this piece of software and will always barely changes so to reiterate if you're just shooting on auto mode on all the phones p40 feels like a literal generation ahead if you are gonna use night mode though the providing things aren't too dark all three are great then to be honest which smartphones photos you prefer is more of a style thing as opposed to one being explicitly better than the others but if you get really dark then something starts acting up when things get so dark that Samsung can't draw out finer details then rather than just keeping the image dark like the iPhone does it has a tendency in night mode to just brighten anyways and I think it looks pretty odd I tried this on both X eNOS and Snapdragon s xx ultras and they behaved similarly no this image was taken in almost pitch black you can't tell nightmare on smartphones is getting good but what I wanted to show here is how always focused on making all of its cameras good not just its main one but for example flicking into ultra wide the difference is just phenomenal especially when compared to the iPhone and I love this idea that I can use whichever lens I want to to suit the shot I'm trying to capture as opposed to feeling like I need to use my main camera because my ultra wide sucks the same goes for zoom this is using the five times zoom in pitch black like I couldn't see what the p40 Pro is seeing right now the s20 ultra and iPhone aren't too pretty however there are two ways to deal with the dark one is night mode sure but the other one is flash and Chloe has added an insanely bright flash module onto its phone of course bright is good but if it's too bright and the software doesn't deal with it accordingly you end up with photos like these the camera tends to severely under expose to try and compensate for the extra brightness the detail is still there if you manually brighten it it looks good but no matter how hard I tried to take this photo it would always come out dark on huawei alright let's slow things down for a minutes literally all three phones can take slow-motion footage to varying degrees you've got continuous slow-motion up to 240 frames per second and I think on balance the iPhone takes the nicest looking slow-motion footage but the other two can do something that the iPhone can't shoot bursts of super slow-motion footage and you're only telling that the p40 pro is inherited the frankly nuts super slow motion from the may 230 pro last year it's so slow it is unreal you could almost say it's borderline boring to watch but with this kind of frame rate your entire perspective on the world is different Apple and Samsung also let you take slow-motion on your front cameras it's cool to have I guess I've not used it once outside of a testing environment but that brings me to the front cameras generally and it's never been a closer battle when it comes to selfies Huawei edges out on detail but for most people I don't think that's a biggie for front-facing photos and they've all got an awesome selfie portrait mode - so which phone do you think one who always phone is still on early software so it might improve but Michael and conclusion is that iPhone is still the king for video but its leaders shrinking over its Android counterparts and also that my favorite phone for photos is now the p40 Pro thanks for watching my name is Aaron this is mister who's the boss and I'll catch you in the next one [Music] what's up every kitten right here so i know i'm late though but i'm sure that you guys know huawei held a huge event yesterday to unveil its harmony operating system 2.0 and show off a couple of tablets a new smart watch and even some gaming monitors well also huawei took the opportunity to air a 45 second promo video of the huawei p50 series so here is the video before look at it the promo is a slow pan showing the quad camera system of the huawei p50 pro and adding a few words the promo video huawei shares that the p50 series have a beautiful thin and light design and that they raise the bar in terms of phone photography like they are making the cameras of the phone even better because the huawei p50 series will feature a one inch camera sensor namely the sony imx 800 and looking at a screen grab from the video the quad camera on the huawei p50 will go from 18 mm to 125 mm suggesting a 5x periscope zoom would account for the long end however it's not officially confirmed though it's just my assumptions but i would say the smartphone looks really pleasing to me like there are a lot of memes going on with the camera module of the p50 but honestly i really love the design because it's unique anyway the video concludes with a wide view of the phone on a sunset horizon and that's it [Music] val you know that huawei unveiled the second major version of harmony operating system 2.0 and several new devices that have it pre-installed but those are two watches and two tablets no phones and yet as of today there are a list of phones that can run the new operating system and honestly though it's a massive migration because the company plans to switch over 100 devices phones and tablets from android over to the harmony operating system 2.0 and know that this will initially only be happening in china so huawei honors in the west will have to wait in fact the company made no mention of when devices abroad will switch to the new operating system anyway here are the first two batches of devices that will be updated and the first batch of devices can jump to the harmony operating system today and the second batch will be invited in quarter 3 like july or september and here is the full schedule you will have to zoom in for a closer look as there are a lot of devices and by the way users who are not comfortable installing the software on their own can visit one of 66 stores in china and have someone help them through the process so yeah are you ready to jump to the new operating system if yes let me know in the comments down below and if you somehow found this video helpful then it's up to the channel will be a great reward for me so as always i'll catch you guys in the next one peace out what's up everybody kitten right here so i was right though because i knew the chinese people will support and love huawei's new operating system because now it seems the new operating system is getting a lot popular in china and it's already breaking all the records because now a new report shows that the harmony operating system is already passed 10 million uses aka active devices which are using it right now which is insane like i can't even imagine though and to mark this big thing as an occasion the company has decided to celebrate with a rather unique looking cake as you can see here it has tws headphones watch phone and a tv or all a diable elements making up the cake by the way anyhow the success of harmony operating system is incredibly quick and it's important to know that harmony operating system isn't just an operating system in fact it seems to act more like an all-in-one umbrella type brand for all of huawei's different operating systems as well as its internet of things stuff it's basically an ecosystem which will connect different products to each other and even you can just tap the harmony operating system running devices to each other and boom you are good to go like it's that much faster and accurate anyway the update of harmony operating system 2.0 is available right now for the huawei mate 40 series p4e series mate 30 series and a mate bad pro in china while the p30 series and honor 30 and v30 series will get close betas this month and public betas in july but still it's only available in china though but it would be interesting to see how the company handles the transition to harmony operating system outside of china like in the international market anyway the number of products running a version of harmony operating system are definitely only set to grow in the future after this great start huawei in fact hopes to achieve 360 million active devices running harmony operating system by the end of the year as well as convincing 1.2 million developers to write apps for its platform so definitely the company is working really really fast to make its operating system more popular and i know it would be really difficult for huawei to achieve the same success in the international market because google is a really really big competitor but still i think they can also get popular in the international market too and they can compete with google also so yeah what do you think about my thoughts well let me know in the comments down below because i would love to read your comments and feedback so yeah if you somehow like this video is up to the channel will definitely make my day so as always i'll catch you guys in the next one peace out [Music] [Music] do do [Music] [Music] do do [Music] [Music] do do [Music] [Music] do do [Music] [Music] do do [Music] [Music] you you check out this phone it's the huawei p50 or it's a render of it and really do i want you to scroll down and then just react just give it to us give us that strong react that we're here for from willy do go ahead big one go ahead wow go ahead um it looks like it has a case on it is that the case or is that the like a regular back it is the case that it has a case on it that is the case uh where's the naked version hey man easy we're live oh yeah sorry sorry um no because if you know the case manufacturer sometimes they uh send stuff out before they should or whatever then so that just so that's just so happens to be what this particular leak is but the main part of the phone the important part of the phone that you need to look at is the camera unit which is about a well she's a big one yes i'm not too bothered by this um the bigger the better i would say um but it would it would have to be like not too thick you know what i mean like the size of it is fine it's just it can't be too thick so what have you willing like mother will the mic for too long he's going who knows where you're working you gotta reign it in sometimes you know he will a mic for too long um i hear you will well you're okay good i'm glad i hear you and i hear you the right way yeah you're saying that the uh the obvious dimension here is the scale across the flat back but the one that actually matters or an equally significant one is the height of the device how much wobble you're going to get from this enormous hump yeah which we've seen a variety of of different uh so implementations is that it right here well it's i don't know if it's official it's a render they're claiming it's a leak but yeah i mean the perception at this point is it's going to look something like that yeah it's not bad cool that's that's a strong react on you well because this is when is it out of control what if it's twice that size i don't mind it if it follows a whole back if the camera quality is good why not but at this point your first sure point fingerprints like where are you holding um think about it in landscape you're watching a video right your mitts are all over those cameras yeah you can't even avoid them at this point um you get all those little warnings please wipe your camera sure um anyway it looks too bad no you're right i i think it actually i kind of like the two the two circle look and then packing multiple cameras into what looks like one camera unit uh what you're what you're seeing here at least in this render who even knows what's real and not i mean it's a render right you have three of the sensors along with a laser focus module that's what's up top there housing the top circle and a single periscope lens in the second circle those obviously are are much larger there's even a leica logo and an led flash inside the oversized pill-shaped camera housing so you know they've had the partnership with leica in the past um so this is the camera the bottom one the periscope style camera so it's like with the with the mirror in it and that's gonna be for your uh far zooming your your zooming or i don't know what you're up to yeah some sort of periscope thing when you're looking across the road like when you just have to you put the curtain like this much hey man i never said that i never said that yeah maybe you were trying to pick up the wildlife yeah you weren't trying not to spook the wildlife okay we were talking about nature before what's the matter with you jeez the way you insinuated it doesn't matter with you anyway yeah so the smartphone cameras they're obviously out of control but people seem to love it people seem to love the cameras getting out of control hello guys vladimir99 here thank you for reaching my youtube channel today i'm going to show you how you can install your my huawei app and be an early bird for the harmony os i have here a matepad pro and as you can see if i access app gallery and search for my huawei app it won't be available but if you will download the file i provide you in the description this file is the my huawei app is the latest version of the chinese version you have to download it and install it on your device for this purpose you don't need any vpn service just wait for the installation to finish installation successful now you can open the app it doesn't matter if you have an huawei id register to outside china or any other country which is unlisted you have to tick these two head to next agree with the terms and now we will get a notification asking us if we want to switch to the china version of this app we tap on yes and it will keep loading [Music] if you don't get this not that this notification you can select from this list china and tap on it the servers are busy and you will get a notification unable to connect to server try again and you will have to keep trying keep tapping this until you will get into the application if you won't be able to con to get into the application you can close the huawei my huawei app try to open it again and tap again on china also i told you the servers are busy if you can't connect you can try out a vpn service and try to connect to a hong kong server and it should work i finally managed to connect to the server as you can see i haven't used any vpn service or something if it won't work you just try to reboot your tablet or go to applications scroll down to my huawei app go to storage clear cache and clear data and it should work okay now it asks me to access the device location and i will allow it and this is the interface of the my huawei app in this announcement it's written in chinese that we the update plan for harmony os will be announced later also i think it will appear in this button it's like an upload button and this will take us directly to the page where we should be able to upgrade to harmony os just stay tuned because huawei team will launch harmony as soon as possible so if you like my work just like it subscribe to my channel and comment we are waiting now for the big moment when we will be able to install harmony os to our device also make sure make sure that your device is in the list which with the devices which will get the update right today okay have a great day bye when it comes to battery life whoa SP 30 when it comes to battery life whoa SP 30 and P 30 Pro have pretty much every and P 30 Pro have pretty much every factor in their favor and I've managed factor in their favor and I've managed to get both devices making this the most to get both devices making this the most important battery comparison we've ever important battery comparison we've ever made we're effectively fitting two whole made we're effectively fitting two whole battery comparisons into one video here battery comparisons into one video here we've got the standard mainline flagship we've got the standard mainline flagship phones from huawei Apple and Samsung but phones from huawei Apple and Samsung but then also their Pro Plus Size variants then also their Pro Plus Size variants so right now I'm using a lock saw meter so right now I'm using a lock saw meter to make sure the brightness is to make sure the brightness is completely calibrated between the completely calibrated between the different screens they might look a different screens they might look a little different here but that's because little different here but that's because the angle they have from the camera and the angle they have from the camera and off we go off we go I've unplugged the cables and the first I've unplugged the cables and the first thing we're gonna do is continuous Skype thing we're gonna do is continuous Skype calling if you take a look at the calling if you take a look at the battery capacities at the bottom you can battery capacities at the bottom you can probably tell Huawei isn't messing probably tell Huawei isn't messing around here the p30 pro out of all the around here the p30 pro out of all the plus size smartphones has the largest plus size smartphones has the largest battery capacity at 4200 milliamp hours battery capacity at 4200 milliamp hours but what is interesting is that it but what is interesting is that it almost looks like they've made it a almost looks like they've made it a mission to beat their competitors in mission to beat their competitors in every category of phone for the standard every category of phone for the standard sized p30 you can see it's got quite a sized p30 you can see it's got quite a bit more battery than the iPhone 10 s bit more battery than the iPhone 10 s and the Galaxy S 10 on paper and the Galaxy S 10 on paper alright so with 40 minutes in which is a alright so with 40 minutes in which is a little early to say anything conclusive little early to say anything conclusive but so far it's looking like team but so far it's looking like team hallway on the far left is winning in hallway on the far left is winning in fact the p30 the standard smaller p 30 fact the p30 the standard smaller p 30 is currently beating every other is currently beating every other smartphone out here right now we're just smartphone out here right now we're just on YouTube then we're watching some of on YouTube then we're watching some of the other mister who's the boss coverage the other mister who's the boss coverage of this phone and we'll leave it on this of this phone and we'll leave it on this for about 30 minutes or so I'll see what for about 30 minutes or so I'll see what videos we end up on one thing worth videos we end up on one thing worth noting is the measures we've had to take noting is the measures we've had to take to try and make this as fair a test as to try and make this as fair a test as possible all phones have Wi-Fi Bluetooth possible all phones have Wi-Fi Bluetooth NFC as well as location turned on and NFC as well as location turned on and for all four Android phones here we for all four Android phones here we haven't touched the resolution setting haven't touched the resolution setting we've just kept it on the default 1080p we've just kept it on the default 1080p that most people will use out the box that most people will use out the box the other really important thing is that the other really important thing is that we're testing phones that haven't been we're testing phones that haven't been used yet when you use a phone as your used yet when you use a phone as your main device you're constantly draining main device you're constantly draining the battery day and day out and these the battery day and day out and these continuous charging cycles degrade its continuous charging cycles degrade its overall capacity and so none of the overall capacity and so none of the devices you're seeing here have been devices you're seeing here have been fully charged and discharged more than fully charged and discharged more than ten times and so even the s 10 plus ten times and so even the s 10 plus you're seeing here is a different S 10 you're seeing here is a different S 10 plus to the one I reviewed and just to plus to the one I reviewed and just to make sure that we're getting make sure that we're getting the best battery life out of each phone the best battery life out of each phone we've now switched from news and social we've now switched from news and social media to something slightly more intense media to something slightly more intense by running f1 mobile a racing game and by running f1 mobile a racing game and we are starting to see some trends when we are starting to see some trends when it comes to battery the two iPhones are it comes to battery the two iPhones are starting to slip behind a little bit and starting to slip behind a little bit and the standard smaller Galaxy S 10 has the standard smaller Galaxy S 10 has lost a lot of battery compared to its lost a lot of battery compared to its larger counterpart if you compare that larger counterpart if you compare that with the p30 and the p30 pro well the with the p30 and the p30 pro well the standard smaller p30 is actually standard smaller p30 is actually slightly ahead and that may well change slightly ahead and that may well change over the course of the test but over the course of the test but nonetheless so far this is an nonetheless so far this is an exceptional result the galaxy s 10 plus exceptional result the galaxy s 10 plus at least when it comes to continuous at least when it comes to continuous screen on time is incredible we did a screen on time is incredible we did a battery test earlier this year when it battery test earlier this year when it came out and it was the leader they beat came out and it was the leader they beat out every current gen flagship out every current gen flagship smartphone so if the hallway beats that smartphone so if the hallway beats that then that's really really something then that's really really something we've just passed the three-hour mark we've just passed the three-hour mark and with this in mind all six flagship and with this in mind all six flagship phones are doing well for battery life phones are doing well for battery life none of these are gonna disappoint none of these are gonna disappoint although on a relative level the iPhone although on a relative level the iPhone 10s and the Galaxy S 10 have fallen 10s and the Galaxy S 10 have fallen quite away behind this starts to build quite away behind this starts to build the kind of picture we were expecting the kind of picture we were expecting given that the standard s10 has a given that the standard s10 has a reasonably sized but not particularly reasonably sized but not particularly large 3400 million power battery mind large 3400 million power battery mind you that looks like a very generous you that looks like a very generous figure next to the iPhone 10s is 2658 figure next to the iPhone 10s is 2658 milliamp hours but Apple's iOS and this milliamp hours but Apple's iOS and this is the latest iOS is just very efficient is the latest iOS is just very efficient at managing limited battery capacity I'd at managing limited battery capacity I'd be interested to see how well these be interested to see how well these iPhones would perform if they were iPhones would perform if they were bundled in with equivalently sized bundled in with equivalently sized batteries alright we've got Facebook batteries alright we've got Facebook open right now we're just watching open right now we're just watching endless pretty useless videos and we're endless pretty useless videos and we're gonna close it down and open up the gonna close it down and open up the camera we're gonna focus on 4k video camera we're gonna focus on 4k video recording something that all phones here recording something that all phones here can do but mind you the latest - Huawei can do but mind you the latest - Huawei flagships can't do 4k video at 60 frames flagships can't do 4k video at 60 frames per second all four other phones can so per second all four other phones can so for the sake of parity we're just gonna for the sake of parity we're just gonna record 4k xxx on all this does big record 4k xxx on all this does big damage to the standard Galaxy S 10 which damage to the standard Galaxy S 10 which is now clinging on to 30% and that's is now clinging on to 30% and that's crazy because the Galaxy S 10 plus is crazy because the Galaxy S 10 plus is still on over 50 after over four hours still on over 50 after over four hours of screen on time worth bearing in mind of screen on time worth bearing in mind whilst don't get me wrong the Huawei p30 whilst don't get me wrong the Huawei p30 phones are cutting edge in many ways phones are cutting edge in many ways they are built on the same chip as the they are built on the same chip as the mate 20 pro last year and it's a super mate 20 pro last year and it's a super efficient efficient chip so it's not a bad thing but it just chip so it's not a bad thing but it just means that any battery efficiency gains means that any battery efficiency gains that you see on this phone versus that that you see on this phone versus that one are most likely due to two things one are most likely due to two things firstly both p30 phones ship with mui firstly both p30 phones ship with mui 9.1 a slightly more refined version of 9.1 a slightly more refined version of the software at the meet 20 pro released the software at the meet 20 pro released with the company said that one of the with the company said that one of the features of this new software is that features of this new software is that the phones will better be able to the phones will better be able to anticipate your behaviors and if you anticipate your behaviors and if you think about it if your smartphone can think about it if your smartphone can successfully predict your behavior then successfully predict your behavior then in theory it should be able to allocate in theory it should be able to allocate resources efficiently ahead of time and resources efficiently ahead of time and so that would explain some battery so that would explain some battery saving the other thing is resolution saving the other thing is resolution whilst the apples and the Samsung's have whilst the apples and the Samsung's have a maximum resolution well above 1080p a maximum resolution well above 1080p both koala flagships are limited to this both koala flagships are limited to this figure which I was kind of surprised by figure which I was kind of surprised by I feel like a 20-19 flagship should be I feel like a 20-19 flagship should be able to go up to a quad HD plus able to go up to a quad HD plus resolution nonetheless we are now well resolution nonetheless we are now well past the five-hour mark what had called past the five-hour mark what had called a SafeZone any smartphone that lasts a SafeZone any smartphone that lasts over five hours of screen on time is over five hours of screen on time is what I'd consider acceptable and so even what I'd consider acceptable and so even though the - 10 s was the first to go though the - 10 s was the first to go and in fact the galaxy s 10 is just gone and in fact the galaxy s 10 is just gone as well they're both ok the battery life as well they're both ok the battery life won't amaze you but more importantly it won't amaze you but more importantly it won't be a concern not at least for the won't be a concern not at least for the first year or so of using them also if first year or so of using them also if you've been checking the figures this you've been checking the figures this test is getting seriously close it's test is getting seriously close it's probably the closest test we've ever probably the closest test we've ever done between the p30 Pro which by the done between the p30 Pro which by the way has overtaken its smaller sibling way has overtaken its smaller sibling now and the S 10 plus dell'utri now and the S 10 plus dell'utri completely neck-and-neck the iPhone 10's completely neck-and-neck the iPhone 10's max has just called it a day max has just called it a day which is good news for huawei it's nice which is good news for huawei it's nice to see that they've shared the battery to see that they've shared the battery love between their standard sized phone love between their standard sized phone and their plus-size model the fact that and their plus-size model the fact that they've got this more compact phone that they've got this more compact phone that can still outlast the suppose it max can still outlast the suppose it max variance of other companies is really variance of other companies is really cool ok so we're nearing the end of this cool ok so we're nearing the end of this test I'm going to put this last section test I'm going to put this last section on fast-forward and we're going to get on fast-forward and we're going to get straight to the final results in sixth straight to the final results in sixth place the iPhone 10s with the result of place the iPhone 10s with the result of nearly 5 hours and 20 minutes which is nearly 5 hours and 20 minutes which is kind of just above what I've consider kind of just above what I've consider acceptable the galaxy s 10 lasted about acceptable the galaxy s 10 lasted about 15 minutes longer than that which is 15 minutes longer than that which is fine but at the same time it's a shame fine but at the same time it's a shame to see it so heavily hindered compared to see it so heavily hindered compared to the amazing s 10 plus for the iPhone to the amazing s 10 plus for the iPhone Tenace max finished at a fraction under Tenace max finished at a fraction under six hours which I'm pretty happy with six hours which I'm pretty happy with it's good performance but I was really it's good performance but I was really surprised by the p30 which managed to surprised by the p30 which managed to last a good 45 minutes longer than the last a good 45 minutes longer than the 10s max and that's the kind of 10s max and that's the kind of difference you would notice on a day to difference you would notice on a day to day basis in second place the galaxy s day basis in second place the galaxy s 10 plus with over its 7 hours of screen 10 plus with over its 7 hours of screen on time and I've said this before but on time and I've said this before but this thing is an absolute tank when it this thing is an absolute tank when it comes to battery life but that means comes to battery life but that means we've got a new battery King the Huawei we've got a new battery King the Huawei at P 30 Pro which lasted over seven at P 30 Pro which lasted over seven hours and 20 minutes Wow I'm incredibly hours and 20 minutes Wow I'm incredibly impressed not hugely surprised because impressed not hugely surprised because on paper it does have everything going on paper it does have everything going for it but nonetheless to see those on for it but nonetheless to see those on paper specifications translate into paper specifications translate into real-world battery performance is still real-world battery performance is still really cool if you enjoyed this video really cool if you enjoyed this video it'll be massively appreciated if you it'll be massively appreciated if you could smash that subscribe button tons could smash that subscribe button tons more really cool stuff coming soon and more really cool stuff coming soon and as always my name is Aaron this is mr. as always my name is Aaron this is mr. who's the boss and I'll catch you in the who's the boss and I'll catch you in the next one next one [Music] [Music] you you what's the favorite kitten right here so finally the wait is over i've been making videos on huawei harmony operating system since it was first announced back in 2018 and finally today huawei officially announced the release date of harmony operating system plus a teaser video so the new operating system will debut during a live stream event held by huawei on june 2 at 8 pm local time where it will officially announce the new operating system while the company posted a teaser video on its webo handle if we look at it the video shows hoard me operating system boot screen which displays huawei before showing the harmony os logo the note at the end of this teaser video says a launch conference will be announced both for me operating system and a product will debut and surely this product is expected to be the huawei mate pad 2 which is rapidly the first device to come with the harmony operating system out of the box yes you heard me right the huawei mate pad 2 will have harmony operating system out of the box furthermore huawei also shared a logo of this upcoming operating system which gives us a short form of harmony os as hm operating system and in my opinion though the logo looks quite good and perfectly fits into the harmony os launch harmony operating system is also called hongmang os in china and is quite popular there but this nickname is pretty unique and will be really really handy and with that said we got a leak which shows the names of 4g smartphones that will launch alongside with the harmony operating system on the launch date and they will get the new operating system out of the box well these phones will be available for pre-orders through both online and offline channels without any down payment and the official sale of these products will start on june 18 while the huawei mate pad 2 will be available a little later or probably by the end of june and i know guys you were thinking why 4g smartphones in this era well the reason is clear though huawei is surely running short of chipsets and the company also wants to push for me operating system to as many as users possible therefore it's the best way to combine both situations and make a good option that could benefit the interest of both the consumer and the company at the same time so yeah finally the huawei harmony operating system is coming to mobile phones on june 2. so yeah are you guys ready for the update if yes let me know in the comments down below and if you somehow found this video interesting then except the channel will be phenomenal for me so as always i'll catch you guys in the next one peace out [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] huh [Music] foreign mega foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign foreign foreign [Music] foreign foreign [Music] you u.s sanctions dramatically slow growth for chinese telecommunications giant huawei revenue for 2020 totaled 137 billion dollars that's about a four percent growth compare that with the roughly 20 bump it saw in the previous year china in fact was the only region where huawei saw positive revenue growth let's bring in the chief security officer of huawei technologies us andy purdy and it's always good to talk to you uh we should note revenue actually declined in q4 by 11 so clearly things not moving in the right direction the company's been very transparent about just how much you've been hurt by us sanctions but when you look at the path forward does it really just come down to the home market of china for huawei at this point no absolutely not uh we're making some progress in a number of other places and and since we're talking about the financials let me just mention that in the spirit of transparency these numbers aren't what we've had in some years however given the pandemic given the challenges around the world given the sanctions that hurt us significantly in 2019 and 2020 and will hurt us even more in in 2021 we are able to support our customers and 1500 networks around the world 20 different uh industries 170 countries so we continue to have although we're not publicly traded we provide audits by kpmg that's a standard unmodified audit opinion so regardless of how bad things are we're going to make sure we're transparent so customers government employees really know what the situation is so we know that this year is going to be tough but we look at the situation as the glass is half full whereas because of the u.s sanctions for the u.s semiconductor industry the glass is definitely half empty and getting worse yeah on that issue the consumer business has taken the biggest hit when you look at even just devices huawei falling out of the top five in terms of smartphone makers we heard from rotating chairman ken who overnight essentially said we haven't been able to see a clear picture and supply for our smartphones what kind of timeline is huawei looking at right now at what point do you run out of supply largely because of the us sanctions well the supply the export controls are not affecting our infrastructure business and of course the claim that we pose a national security threat in the infrastructure business as part of the reason for the export controls really doesn't make any sense so we're hoping there'll be a revisiting of the impact on american employees but our consumer business is making some substantial progress and will continue to as we focus on things like smart office fitness and health smart home easy travel and entertainment uh and when you look at the at the broader picture which is innovation 5g generally we have 3 000 5g innovation projects in industries around the world coal mining steel ports production manufacturing so we're going to be hurt this year but we're in this for the long haul so so we're going to be fine but but on the supply issue of smartphones specifically what's the timeline do you have i mean how much more can you continue without the supply coming in because the export controls well we are pursuing as you know alternatives which is one of the reasons we upped in this year 2020 we invested about 21 billion dollars in r d i think we're in the top three in the world so we are trying to find ways we are trying to find alternatives uh and we're we're going to get through we hope there'll be a reconsideration of the export controls on the ability of us to partner with google in terms of the android system we don't see any argument that there's a national security threat and it definitely has an impact on google and frankly in terms of the security of the ecosystem it's really great if we can be an active partner in the android system it really helps everyone yeah and andy i mean to keep his point there obviously i think uh it would be very clear why it would be good to get these sanctions out of the way but you as your role here as usa chief security officer i mean what more can you do to maybe approve that point if not directly with the bind administration beyond just to the public what is it that you think can be better i guess proven out there to to put those concerns to rest well i think we have to look at the larger world and in terms of your question our priority so our priorities are hoping that the export controls uh can be lifted to allow american companies to sell non-sensitive technologies to huawei and that hopefully our cfo mong won joe can can be released so the issue about the export controls that's going to be between the american semiconductor industry and the u.s government there are a number of things happening around the world there's some very important things happening in the u.s regarding supply chain risk we hope in light of the recent solar winds attacks on the microsoft exchange server two of the largest cyber attacks in history the us government we believe working with the private sector is really going to improve supply chain risk metrics we just saw last week the information technology industry council released a principles for supply chain risk where they said country of origin is only one of 188 factors so we're hoping that as the u.s improves supply chain security for the u.s working more multilaterally now with our partners that at some point uh the the government will conclude that it's okay to sell those non-sensitive technologies to us that go into our mobile devices what's the company looking at right now for additional sources of revenue there have been reports out there that you are doubling down on the ev space potentially providing technology although you're not actually building out the cars themselves is that an avenue that the company sees as a potential opportunity well the communications and sensing infrastructure of automobiles is very important part of our overall consumer device and enabled uses strategy that we believe as we move from 5g to 5.5 g is going to continue to be very very important and that's one of the reasons why we look at our partnership our partnership with carriers with companies enterprises uh around the world uh that people will have a greater understanding that it's shared success it's not about us making money we partner with a lot of folks so when you see and some companies in the us are afraid to speak out publicly because of the toxic political environment you see folks know that they can make money working for us it's not about us taking every dime out of it it's a shared success that's going to come from these technologies and the impact of blocking our ability to compete where there's no national security connection really has a dramatic impact on american consumers and american businesses yeah we'll see if that stance uh from the government changes but andy purdy huawei technologies usa chief security officer appreciate you taking the time to join us today we can go in without who the protec problems and this is really hold hey guys what's up my name is Jonathan from swag cell today I will show you how to install the Google Play service in Google Play Store without the notifications from Google

first time to bring you Huawei Hongmeng OS some key The first experience of hardware Monk, monk, monk You've heard this many times before First time in our channel with you The first is Huawei Mat Pad Pro power by Harmony OS This is of great significance Huawei's What 3 Pro And, of course, Hongmeng's mobile phone As they set a magnificent ecology There may not be that much hardware out there right now But the key pieces are all there But this little white video Start to remember three or two videos from the thumb up collection Waiting for you ok? Let's start with this side of the pie The most important thing is power by homos It's not Android anymore 10 V 4 mx 40 watt charging head There should be several colors in the material this time I was a little surprised this time He used plastic shells But this time he has the plastic version I expect that leather version will be very, very hard to get The ID aspect is the same as before N ot much has changed Tablets and things like that You can't get anything out of this again And then the camera This parameter we type out for you is one A combination of three shots This time he used one A design for the 8 speakers There are two in each of them Haman Caton He did give it to me the first time I watched it A lot of shock Let's listen The first thing I feel when I hold it in my hand A 12.6-inch slab It's not as heavy as you think He's 609 grams and then the thickness is The 6.7 mm And then there's the all-important Kirin 9000 chip Of course, this one was very, very unexpected He also has a Snapdragon 870 version Is this a What does that mean Yeah, I don't know. This is actually nine grand This should be a ring One of the biggest threats of the past two years Just how much Huawei has left Kirin 9000 This screen should be a domestic one The specific manufacturer of Ole Lai We didn't find it 2560 * 1600 One hundred percent DCSP 3 He dote It's less than 0.5 This aspect of colo r accuracy is also screen-by-screen adjustment This can also be used as a monitor Levels used on one screen But it's a pity that he doesn't have a high brush 60 hz Plus 120 Hz touch sampling rate According to our profile The original was a high brush on the plan But because of some overwhelming factors Eventually they switched to domestic ones This screen doesn't have a high brush Other just say convenient return ok The sides are of equal width It seems to me that he It's almost as narrow as the plate is Why is it because technology can be narrower Personally, I don't think it's worth pursuing The ultimate tablet Let's say it's a line at the end In that case the security is not Is there a problem? Or when you hold it in both hands This hand is occupied Isn't that a little too much screen area If the structural strength is enhanced then say something else This m penso This pen has been updated as well First, the appearance ID aspect He's really more like a pen The same silver penhol der But this nib The position of a transparent ah It's kind of technological This time he connected all the interfaces They all become one The small ball is attached to a larger one This is a very iconic icon on Hongmeng He's in the Huawei memo @ Can be implemented That's a pretty low latency of 9 milliseconds And he has the pressure of this 4096 Hung Meng, I'm sorry Our version is 9.2 This is a system for a tablet This time Huawei Mate Pad Pro The biggest highlight is probably multi-screen collaboration Yes, Huawei this time Pad and laptop ecology Based on Hong Meng finally got through There are three modes to choose from: mirroring extension and sharing The first two are actually quite understandable Mirroring is something like a projection Copy your screen to the Met Pad for display Development is the common extension of the desktop outside the machine display Use the PID as a side screen It brings direct improvement to work efficiency The most interesting feature is the sharing fea ture Click on the Shared Then there was no PPO Will revert to a flat panel system It's the same as when you use it, right But when the mouse pointer crosses the edge of the screen It will turn into a small ball on the pad Acting as a mouse pointer Small round ball stays on the icon It's going to have a magnifying effect There is a circle Use light operations to highlight your chosen project When the small round ball stays in an app such as Settings Gallery After a while He'll pop up a preview of the content Of course,
This function requires third-party software to perform Adaptation, the most important thing is in this mode You can just drag and drop and copy Paste the inside of PC and pie All text and picture files are OK Like a picture on the computer I pulled the end of the pie I made a copy of it at home Drag and drop text Just paste it and copy it This is not too cool When we were working on this copy Just write the script While looking up information . The file image to be referen ced Text directly drag and drop It can be quickly added to our document Dragging is the most direct operation of the human body Instead of complex connections or shortcuts Have both devices on the store side I got another thumb up detail straight through It's the left and right automatic recognition of the screen arrangement This one's a little bit dark tech He was launched from a PC To locate the tuple's approximate position To determine which screen is on the left and which is on the right He will automatically make a judgment for you at the first sign of coordination This might not seem like an obvious feature In fact, it is very convenient for your daily use After all as a daily Equipment that you pick up at your fingertips As Fuping's position He's not going to be fixed OK Red Devils S second key hardware watch The Huawei Watch 3 O It's just a titanium watch chain A white magnet charger with a brown belt There are no contacts behind this Just put it on The third brown watchband li es in ruler 3 I don't know what happened this year I prefer this silvery gray color I bought a lot of this silver-gray stuff today It's a little bit more technical And then the whole chain is made of titanium Very light clasp This shape is the same as the previous Porsche model Same thing This textural aspect of the whole Just to keep the toughness of the metal And it's not that heavy. This watch The first thing you feel when you hold it It's just that it's thicker than the previous one You can have a look The whole design aspect of this ID Appearance is the scale of this number with a circle added This positioning of PRO It's also more businesslike More mature wind Some overall table volume aspects Of all the smartwatches It's kind of a big one In terms of material Worce 3 is full for you this time Sapphire in the front and titanium in the middle And then on the back this is a ceramic one The volume of this gem 3 Actually, personally, I like it best I don't know if there are any more Too metal watch chain I'll take this version if it's available Because of that, I think it's a little bit bigger and thicker Its surface? Is a 2.5D piece of glass covered And this Pro side It is a flat sapphire of a glass This watch looks like It's a little softer It's not that hard Representation of stainless steel Relatively more likely to be contaminated with fingerprints But this volume here I am Like the I'm wearing something like this. I think this Kind of suited to that Right? The gym kind, more muscular It's bigger This time watch map navigation It is a kind of embodiment of the distributed concept of HongMeng After you start navigation on your phone You can optionally push navigation information to the watch You don't need to turn on your phone afterwards Just check your watch Encounter an intersection that requires a turn The watch will send out a vibration reminder Or for safety reasons Watch navigation only supports walking and cycling Wai said The watch will also support D idi The driver's license plate number Distance information is also pushed to the watch Save the trouble of pulling out your phone But this feature We haven't pushed the version we have yet Haven't fill in The red envelope is the key function of the app All support push to the watch Let the watch become the most efficient hand control center Instead of simply looking at the message Sports health This is a Huawei watch The key feature of labelling sex is up There are 100 modes of movement indoor and outdoor 85 custom functions He plays almost every sport you can think of If you don't know what exercise to do You can go the other way and find one that fits you Very, very many arms
13 series of satellites with built-in Beidou GPS Locating motion trajectory It's pretty cool to be able to generate video Compared with other equally supported new rates Belief monitoring equipment In our comparison Huawei watches are the biggest difference He works with a number of professional organizations Le t the monitoring of all kinds of data have higher value Instead of just telling you What are your statistics like Or you have a problem Participate in cardiovascular health studies You can use that data Really get to know your state Detect abnormalities early There is also a practical fall detection for the elderly That's why a lot of people buy them for their elders Of course we want you to You'll never use this feature Of course,
Except for the aforementioned Wai Watch 3 Series It also added a temperature check And a follow- up respiratory disease risk screening bureau warning This function? Also be with huazhong university of science and technology the same class medical school Joint study of affiliated hospitals at the same level Screening for various physical problems It provides a new direction And under all this versatility This time we were surprised Watch 3 pro In 4 g Smart Classic mode It also offers five days of extra battery life Word 3 supports three days of ultra-long batt ery life You know in a credit card watch That's pretty good battery life Before, I used to charge it one day Although the Reds S Is an underlying system that spans mid-range types But as soon as you mention Hongmeng Naturally, it's the phone we hold in our hands every day The one in my hand The Charisma 40 Pro is loaded with Red Devil S 2. The first feeling of hands-on experience I guess a lot of beta testers are like me It's just two words that are smooth And in the early stages of the experience We didn't even notice Did he turn on the high brush After opening the high brush, it is silky and delicate Let's compare Emu, for example 11 and MIT 40 Pro The operation of opening the app The explanation is not obvious enough We set the animation zoom to 5 times the speed Now you can see Emir clearly 11 Taobao is direct I opened the interface with you This is what we often say silly fast And I'm going to app on red S It does zoom in from the icon To the entire interface The increase in time is also not significant There are also some detailed animations This is a small operation when you go into multitasking All were recorded at 90 stitches for comparison And you can decide which one is red, red S Which one is em y one one You can walk around the wave barrage Do 321 feel left The side is a little bit more natural So that's the sum and MOS It's a little bit more fluid here In fact, he is not the truth of the difference Instead, it adds intuitive details You can find and MOS Between the window is actually linkage ah They have access to And it has an inertial effect when it's shaking Emu doesn't It's just a simple finger movement Oh, come on. Let's think about this Android can do the same Yes, Android does But it's going to require a very deep change to Android And it's a huge amount of work It's like redecorating a house The red mask is integrated into the system as a link at the bottom It also takes into account future upgrades In other words, it's newer When developers ar e developing F Just follow the rules of the Red Gate The same smoothness can be achieved across all platforms Animation and low latency You know, it's only developer-friendly that's convenient You have to use things to make the system work Can refer to the fruit next door And the loading problem is also interesting If you're watching this video, you can pause it Whatever phone you're using Taobao load speed In the case of quick flipping The page needs to linger to load images Reddream S is synchronous loading The image loads when you swipe it The brush for a quick These details are optimized to make you feel red dream s More fluid reasons In the most direct level of interface interaction I think about it a little bit differently A large folder is a larger version of a folder Ah, that's a bit of nonsense The folder becomes 2 by 2 And f in the folder You can just click on the icon to open it Easy to install a bunch of things like that But only a few of them are used on a daily basis You can put them wherever you like The app doesn't really change much under the new interface But both on the Pad and on the phone You can see that some of the f's are underlined You can slide straight up The phone opens the universal card Take a quick look at what you want or what you want to do Like checking the number of steps or jumping into a selfie You can click on the pin Attach the card to the table It becomes your quick action button Of course,
This also needs a third party to adapt ah Like this Youku right now You can pass the universal card Go straight to binge-watching There is no feeling very similar to this operation And Vivo Oranges desktop components It's kind of close But relatively speaking Huawei's seems more intuitive and practical This is actually one of Hongmeng's ideas Principled service The universal card breaks up the app's functions Only provide the functionality you need where you need it Instead of searching through the app one by one The -1 screen of the phone It is a resident center for various atomization services Click on the card to complete the various operations Take a taxi with one click Check out your local movie theater And these operations are APP free Even if you don't have an app installed You can also use it directly Soul in the Emir 11 phone We talked about that in those videos Use the previous pad to fight the god The second one is not this pad It's in the form of cell phone force It is also the software and hardware of the redwood system A representation of the shattering atoms in the painting This is the hardware level Let's take a look at all of this Everything seems to be, except multi-screen synergy A single experience Seems like other houses can do it Hongmeng promotes the infinite possibilities of connectivity Where are the possibilities In fact, the service of the atom you just saw Because of the service form of the atom The equipment that runs through the entire system For example, the Hongmeng school, for example, th e Hongmeng watch Huai Ruo 10 series 3 watches fly The screen is the same as the one on your phone It's divided into several modules Cloud assistant weather stopwatch navigation and so on Finally, there are smart cards In addition to the weather and Huawei Chang Lian There are no other services But in the future it will be the same as on mobile phones Support the use of all kinds of universal cards At present, all kinds of smart watches need linkage Then you're on the watch Then download a watch version of this IP On the Red Devils, there is no need to install an app Just like the first cab ride we mentioned earlier Display license plate and location You can just pull up the card of the atom Developers can do it all in one development Just adjust the watch when you need it Just use cards with relevant functions No more love needed HongMeng equipment It seems to me that there is also a very explicit change Super mid-range You must remember these four words I'm going to talk about this a lot It's also a very core feature He can be said to be the beginning of Hongmeng Interconnection In the control center where the phone is sliding You can see the super weight screen Here you can see you directly It's equipped with the Hongmeng system Could you really be a number-one who knows nothing White relies on the simplest intuition We want to connect these two devices together Just pull the pad directly toward the center I immediately put my phone on my pad It's not just a screenshot You can also copy the file text by dragging and dropping As well as direct photos and other content Import the document you are editing Get through the use of both devices Let me give you an example Out of office is using pies to edit documents At this time Someone else sent you the information via WeChat You don't have to log in to WeChat again on a pie Just a little bit You can import the data into the pie side You can go straight through the pie Communicate with others on their mobile phone WeCha t In fact, the super single set of connection logic is Humans are the simplest Direct intuition II don't care what your complicated luck is Calculate and connection I want these two devices connected right now I want this picture right now Just come and pull It feels so headstrong The Red Gate hardware After we filled in for a while The one that impressed me most personally The most thumb up worthy It is also one of the many connections that must be addressed Underlying problem Is the delay The delay at the red gate is really low How low is he We figured out a way We put the Pad and the phone together And turned on the stopwatch function Then stop You can see the difference between the Pad and the phone It's about 40 milliseconds That's the delay of the screen projection You probably don't have a clue It's lower than the minimum latency of your Bluetooth headset Close to double or more Of course, this test method may not be very accurate Because Huawei officials say the delay is as low as 30 milliseconds This is you projecting a game A rhythm that can't be felt And in order to achieve this low latency It's not an app Or the system can be modified to achieve it The whole system was designed at the beginning Pave the way for him Paving the way for possible hardware in the future Even if it's not connected in the super middle As long as you're in the same network In the file management and gallery Also be able to directly access your Documentation of other mahogany equipment Picture and call quickly It actually gets through file transfer between devices Not only that Even if it's not a mahogany device Yes, we're talking about PCs The PID we talked about above is in the PC On the function of the Is the cell phone red too The underlying system is all the same and that's fine Just click on the link Not only can achieve the same low latency screen projection operation The phone's storage can also be set directly as a USB flash drive Copy and copy directly in the file manag er Since it's the Internet of Everything And not just between Pads, of course It could also be Watch and Prad Pad and Smart Screen Smart screens and phones Mobile Phones and Displays As long as it's a supported device All can be easily pulled through the super terminal They can be attached together Empty sight is believing Want to listen to music But the volume on Pi's phone is too low I don't want to take it with me As long as it's near other equipment You can use smart prompts Quickly put music into the speaker smart screen Even on the display of the Hongmung system If you wear a watch can be cut at will Pause to adjust volume When I check my headphones, I notice that the show I'm watching has been updated But the screen is too small to look good Just tap it on the super middle end of the phone The video is already on when you pick it up Is directly watched here and then click like Mobile phones can also connect their displays wirelessly Spare me the trouble now It's just that the cu rrent computer model is still under development There is currently no support for using the phone as an exit code But the keyboard and mouse can be connected through the monitor You no longer need Bluetooth keys and mice to use them together This brings us closer to a truly wireless desktop That's one more step But so far It was indeed his own The devices can be connected to each other Of course,
The connections between these devices are already very complicated The accompanying function Apple has been doing this for a long time Apple's experience already does a pretty good job But we also need to know Hongmeng: That's what it is The first edition Push it out to the public for use and public beta Iron Man is not in a cave I just went straight ahead and made an antigrand Gram-armored and nano-armored A plane in the sky It's not going to go through the speed of sound in one step And just emerged Only two or three years It's going to be in addition to apples The first system to achieve su ch connectivity Why is it not worth a little praise and pride These connected experiences also give us a glimpse What is the underlying interconnection of everything you want to achieve It's about breaking the function and the device completely And realize the free combination of hardware and function This sentence does sound a bit abstract Every piece of equipment in your home is Part of a system Every function is part of the system And the tool to operate the system is any one of them It's a handy device It could be a pad or a cell phone It could be a watch or it could be a monitor Even a refrigerator with a screen And this device is The big ball in the middle of the super terminal interface His other AIDS are small balls around him What functions do we theoretically need in the future Just connect it directly Let's just think about it for a second Like the TV of the future It could just be an oversized quality Very nice display What else does he have All he needs is HongMeng's netwo rking capabilities Even a network can call the mobile phone pie Or the hardware of the computer Play the video Music games have a variety of features The air conditioner can call the temperature and humidity sensor at the head of the bed No built-in sensor required Closer to the human body So it's a little bit more accurate In fact, these are all in general The previous Android has also been imagined and practiced But we also see that progress is indeed slow Or can't do it at all What Hongmeng is really doing That's one of the biggest obstacles to the current interconnection Fragmented operating systems This might be a little abstract But he's like an interface You can't use HDMI as USB for data transfer many
What you take for granted is impossible to achieve Many operating systems don' t support it at all Simple smart hardware You may not know that Android 11 Minimal operating requirements Memory needs to be 512 megabytes And devices that are less than 512 MB You can't run the latest A ndroid operating system Red ink design at the beginning He allowed for memory as small as 128 K of the equipment What is 128 K He is a mobile phone with 8G memory of 60,000 1/5536 Because of the Hongmeng system itself He himself is a fragmented module It's like a Lego That's a big picture you took for your phone You just build a big one Wear or smaller LT lamp It's a little device like a kettle Just put it together in a few small pieces Unified systems make the most sense It's a great convenience Software and function development And function calls between different devices For example, the air conditioning adjustment mentioned above Use temperature and humidity sensors If you do not understand the brand of equipment Design interfaces of at least two brands are required And then they call each other And if they're all flying Reddream S You just need to open the interface directly Just wait to be called You don't need to install an app to use it Open Hyperterminal Just pop up the card T he red sign is a small ball and I asked for a big ball What devices do people use What device is the super middle one in the center Of course people want more and more small balls Because the more devices you can connect to The more services can be provided In fact, the connection between these devices is a little bit like ours Similar characters and like-minded friends ah The more good friends you have The more people who can help you Why can you be good friends Because of your base The same layer system is the same character ah Communication without pressure It's more efficient You just have to live in this world You get connected to all kinds of people and things In the story You before the video Just through this video It's relevant to us And now you fire a barrage With other friends who are watching the video and sending off barrage It makes a connection The network is made up of endless connections And that's what made the world And it's the connected 2021 Many devices do not hello everybody welcome back to another episode of ichimi so on today's episode we are going to briefly talk about what apple has introduced during the wwdc 2021 and that includes ios 15 and also a new continuity feature called universal control huawei malaysia on the other hand is about to launch the huawei mate pad pro 12.6 in malaysia soon and this tablet runs on harmony os2 so if you want to learn more remember to stay tuned during wwdc 2021 apple has introduced ios 15 which will be introduced later this year despite earlier rumors ios 15 still shares the same device compatibility with ios 14. that means if your phone is currently running on ios 14 it will be able to receive the latest ios 15 update that includes the iphone 6 the iphone 6 plus as well as the first generation iphone se ios 15 is now available for apple developers and it will be released for public beta in july the final ios 15 version is expected to be rolled out around september or october alongside the new iphone models but compared to ios 14 the ios 15 isn't that groundbreaking some of the new features include improved facetime with shareplay updated imessage app improved dnd mode with focus and notification summary there is also an updated photos and camera app which now supports live text recognition and translation besides ios 15 apple has also introduced a new continuity feature called universal control if you own several apple products you can now work seamlessly with a single keyboard mouse and also trackpad two years ago mac os catalina enabled mac users to turn their compatible ipad with ipad os 13 into a secondary display now you can move freely between your mac and ipad even quicker without lifting your hands from your macbook with universal control enabled you can use the keyboard and mouse on your mac to control your ipad when you move the cursor to the far edges of the mac screen the cursor will switch to the ipad screen just like how you have to spare a monitor connected to your computer the trackpad gestures and keyboard shortcuts are also supported as well in terms of compatibility is available for imac macbook air and macbook pro from 2015 and above as well as mac pro from the late 2013 and mac mini from late 2014. huawei malaysia is about to

notification bell icon so you won't miss any of our future videos and i'll catch you guys in the next one bye in this video we're taking a look at the huawei mate pad pro 12.6 this is the first huawei device coming in with their very own harmony os that's their version of android by google i'm usually not very keen on tablets because i don't understand their use case but in this video we're going to figure out how this tablet performs both with hardware and software let's get started so let's begin with the design on this first sound wise it's not something out of the ordinary you get a 12.6 inch oled display with a pretty impressive 90 screen to body ratio because of those uniform bezels all around overall the design does look pretty premium and elegant you've got nice rounded corners no flashy business it's also not too heavy and it's pretty comfortable to carry around and interact with now the screen resolution on this is 2560 by 1600 pixels with a total of 240 ppi that's actually pretty sharp even though it's slightly less compared to the samsung tab s7 plus that we reviewed earlier that actually brings me to something i was slightly dissatisfied with on this tab the refresh rate not only does it not have a super high refresh rate like the tab s7 plus of 120 hertz you don't even get the new benchmark 90 hertz of refresh rate this one's capped at 60 hertz of refresh rate that's not really terrible but it is something that feels a little bit outdated on a new 2021 device the display brightness on this is capped at 380 nits which is pretty good for most indoor situations but using it outdoors you will face a bit of a challenge however the refresh rate and the brightness does not take away from how gorgeous this display really looks you get those high deep contrasted blacks with vivid colors you can even get fairly decent color accuracy with this making it good enough to color grade and color correct pictures the thumbnail of this video was actually edited on the matepad pro when it comes to the actual consumption of content though on the display even though youtube is a google service you get the in browser support to enable full screen and you can view videos in 4k resolution even though the device can support hdr and can give you res up to 4k when you're watching movies apps like netflix don't let you really get that you will consume content in sd unfortunately because of the policies but hopefully we get to see that change in future policy changes and updates moving on to the audio this is somewhere the huawei mate 5 pro can show off a little bit you get a total of eight speakers split both ways four on either side and the quality of the speakers is surprisingly really good there are a total of eight speakers with four located on either side these are tuned by harman kardon and each of the speakers have a large speaker for both lows and mids as well as a smaller speaker for the heist let's kill him properly this time the overall result is a great sounding built-in speaker definitely one of the best we've tested out on a mobile or portable device music sounds rich you get a pretty good balance of mids lows and highs and nothing is too tinny or too bassy this obviously results in an overall great experience for listening to music or consuming content there's obviously no 3.5 mm jack so you'd have to use an external adapter if you want to connect your headphones it does come with the adapter included in some regions so that's pretty great as well now there is no fingerprint sensor on this so for unlocking it uses facial recognition this isn't like the 3d recognition it's more like image recognition so it does work pretty intuitively and well might not be the most secure but it does work both in landscape mode and vertical now i don't know about you guys but with a tablet i would expect a stylus unfortunately this does not come with the stylus which is a bit weird but you can purchase the m pencil the second version which is pretty much one of the coolest things when you accompany it with this tablet even though this is sold separately and it is not very cheap i would say this is a must-have if you're using the huawei mate pad pro obviously out of everything this is one of the things that really sold me towards purchasing a tablet it's super responsive with a very low latency of just nine milliseconds the screen supports up to 4096 pressure sensitivity with selected applications very similar to the competition out there it's capable of charging wirelessly when mounted to the side of the tablet magnetically magnetically magnetically the m pencil may be my favorite part of using the tablet because it's designed so well the edges being curved and the way it fits in your hand feels a lot better and you also get different mode switches like phantom touches to switch between different modes when you're taking notes for writing and erasing the other worthy accessory which you can purchase separately is the smart magnetic keyboard which is a combination of a cover or stand along with a keyboard again all of this is connected magnetically magnetically why does this word sound weird the keyboard is actually enjoyable to type on especially considering the fact that it is use a 13 inch macbook i'm kind of used to the smaller keyboards now and this does feel pretty good it has a pretty nice travel distance and the separation on the keys is quite nice and overall the typing experience is pretty much as intended it works well next i want to talk a little bit about harmony os this is their new os coming in so it's kind of their first test for it and from using it it does feel pretty well optimized and functions really really nicely you still got the pedal search in case you're looking for applications that are not available on the huawei app gallery they've really expanded on the list so you can find pretty much all the applications you're looking for and the petal search is a great addition on top i was able to download pretty much any application i was looking for on top of the built-in 256 gb of storage they also have their proprietary nano sd card slot so you can expand storage if you still need to now let's move on to the multi-tasking capabilities on the map pro the matepad pro lets you take control and customize the way you multitask with multiple windows support you can resize reposition customize exactly how you want to interact with all these apps simultaneously these are however limited to two apps at the same time if you want to use them on screen swiping and holding from either side of the tablet shows you the list of applications that do support multitasking and if you press and hold an application on an existing open application it splits it up into two windows which are resizable so you can customize how open or small you want each tab this can also be done by making them into smaller vertical applications so it makes it look like a mobile app and these two can be opened simultaneously for me personally the multitasking experience was quite enjoyable whether that was opening up the browser to look for information while typing in the notes or writing with the pencil or if i want to watch a video while i'm editing pictures that's pretty much what i used it for for the most part listening to music or watching videos while i was doing another task and i really did enjoy that unfortunately like previous generations you don't really get the desktop mode on this like the samsung decks for example or the emui versions from before however you can still connect the matepad pro to a huawei laptop through a feature called multi-screen collaboration so the mirror mode on this allows you to mirror the laptop screen onto the tablet so you can use the m pencil for your laptop applications for the ones that support it that's awesome apart from that obviously you can also mirror your display meaning that you can extend your laptop screen to another display or just replicate whatever you're seeing also if you do have a huawei smartphone content sharing has become easier than ever you can replicate your screen off your smartphone onto the tablet and then transfer data from them back and forth as you can see adam from adam lobo tv do that we don't have a huawei smartphone so check out his video if you're keen on that as well now to get away with all this crazy multitasking and multi-window support it's powered by the huawei kirin 9000 e5g flagship chipset it's pretty much the same flagship chip but with a lighter version of the gpu this is brilliant for most multitasking and gaming for example was a breeze on this i didn't feel any downsizing in the graphics for example and everything felt very smooth intuitive no lag issues whatsoever playing at max resolution max settings was a breeze definitely an enjoyable experience that's also thanks to the massive massive battery on this it comes with a 10 050 milliamp hour battery this will last you upwards of 14 hours of battery life whether you're browsing or consuming content on obviously this depends on your usage but that's roughly about where we got out of it it also comes with a 40 watt charger included in the box which can charge it up from zero to 30 in about 30 minutes now considering the size of the battery that's fairly fast it also does support wireless charging and reverse wireless charging now the cameras on this is something i'm not gonna waste a lot of time on because really who uses cameras on tablets so if you're in the huawei ecosystem you own any huawei devices like their laptop or their smartphones or their buds or whatever this would definitely be a great tablet for you if you're looking for a tablet definitely a complete tab with everything you would need from it apart from that refresh rate if you're able to overlook that you'd be pretty happy with the huawei matepad pro 12.6 it's a great creator's tablet and gets you away with a lot of stuff the thing that i enjoyed the most on this was editing pictures while multitasking and watching videos that was my favorite part of using this and also the gaming yeah if you guys enjoyed this video be sure to like the video if you did so that more people get to see it hope you enjoyed this and we'll see you again in the next video until then [Music] good evening everyone welcome to huawei's launch of harmony os2 and all scenario new products over the past decade we have witnessed a significant transformation to see a very famous product brand we have realized a lot of innovations we have guided the trend for the phone-based shooting for photos and also for videos and also for other sectors we are leading this world of mobile phone and we have solved a lot of problems for the mobile phone making we have extended the capacity of the batteries we have applied new materials and new techniques and especially over the past two years we have the foldable smartphones we have this enabled technology and we have also entered this year the pc sector we have realized the seamless connection of our technology with our daily work we have also the smart screen for the tv and nowadays we have upgraded the experience with the tv and we have also significantly modified the experience of our healthy living for example the smart watch and also other wearables and also the wireless earphones the real authentic wireless earphones that can enable a high quality of the listening to music and other sounds for our viewers we are turning all the impossible into possible make the impossible possible we would like to create more possibilities and choices for our customers so that we can provide more extreme users experience for the next decade our long-term strategy is to have this all scenario strategy for the daily living for our people for example for the sports for the video and sound and also for the intelligent houses etc and today we're about to bring a high weight a big weight to you this is our operating system called harmony if we look at the operating system after the invention of the personal computers in the 1980s and then to 2000 we started to have the mobile equipments and operating systems and gradually we have the android and also ios and today we come to a new era where everything is connected and it's more intelligent however we know that everything is so complicated and usually we have fragmented experience how can we improve the experience of our users so today we see that for the mobile phones for the tablets for the watch and also for the tv and for cars and also for the smaller objects of daily life we have created this operating system if we give for each type of product an individual operating system then it will make the whole system really complement really complicated and we would like to make everything into one that is the harmony os [Music] this is the operating system it can be used with our watch and mobile phone and cars tablets tv etc and also it can be used in a wide range of i o t objects for example the lamps and other home appliances so today harmony os is enabling the utilization with a wide range of products one as all all as one that's what it means in a chinese name of harmony os and now i'd like to invite um dr wong chung lu the president of the software department and the president of the ai and all scenario intelligence business unit to share with you more details thank you ladies and gentlemen good evening it's a very great pleasure for us uh to introduce to you this harmony os2 we have decided from the very beginning to use one set of codes to satisfy the amounts of different types of hardwares this is our starting point and today for the single operating system it can be used with the mobile phone with a watch with the tv etc even with a very small volume of the equipment like 128k so it is only one uh it's the first one of its kind to enable such a unique uh system for almost everything so it's also the starting line for the internet of things for the connectivity of everything we have the distributed architecture and also we have the soft major pipeline for the soft pipeline it seems that there's the highway connecting different devices and our users can choose all the necessary devices they need and put them connected to the same highway so we can so have a review of the history when we replace the functional mobile phones with the smartphones we have these new changes for example we can decide what kind of softwares we would like to have within our mobile phones so it means that we by using the smartphones have enabled our users to select whatever softwares they would want and today by using this distributed architecture and this highway-like connection method we can enable our customers to put all the hardwares they want together for example if they want to shoot a scenario from different angles then they could connect for example their cameras and also the drones and also their mobile phone together then those three different diver devices could diversify the angles of the shooting also in the office we can use this highway to connect the big screen with the tablets with your computer and then with your mobile phone we can tackle our daily tasks with our mobile phone and later we could also use another device to get the same set of documents pre-assessed and of course the room is so big for us to use our enough imagination to have this connection of all the devices however we would like to make sure that no matter how many devices are connected together you can always use them as one [Music] [Music] harmony os will give you a unified control center by which you can manipulate the modules and also the other devices connected to your phone it can also enable you to use these os to form different kinds of super centers of connection for example you can choose different channels for the playing of music if you have activated different apps for the music playing and then use the card you can select different apps to play the music and then for the output you can also choose your favorite option for example whether it will be played by the bluetooth speaker or by your phone or by the tv etc and for the selection of the bluetooth you can use this page with one tab it's connected and also with the control center with all the third-party devices connected to your phone we use this card to display their mode whether it's activated or not and for the third-party equipment connected with the phones you can manipulate them in real time of course there are more functions enabled by this operating assistant and by this control center with the harmony os 2 finally all the devices will be combined and integrated into one super terminal in the past we need a lot of hardwares and the real tangible wires to connect different devices however today we have an entry called the super terminal you just use a tab and then all the surrounding equipments by your phone would appear on your screen and if you want to connect two of them you just need to drag one towards the another and then they are connected so that is a procedure much much easier than today's existing options for you i believe that you can understand this point immediately actually it seems so simple for the procedure however for our development process it's much more complicated we have to do the discovery the matching connection coupling and finally the verification only by going through all those steps can we enable the successful connection of every two pieces or even more pieces of devices we can imagine several scenarios the first one is when you are listening to music with your phone due to the limits of its hardware within the mobile phone the quality is quite limited if you have wonderful speaker by your side then you can first activate the control center and also drag the sign of your mobile phone and the speaker and then you have formed the super terminal and the sound will be played out immediately by the speaker nearby so that means that with a single tap you can let the speaker play your music and for example first you listen to the music on the balcony and then you go back inside the room and you would like to match the speaker with your phone and then immediately the sound has been transmitted about the video sure it can be enabled with the video too for example you are watching a video clip with your phone and later you would like to use your tv screen in the living room to play the video and then you just drag the symbol and then immediately your video will be played by the swing of the tv and currently this experience of video for our customer would be far more impressive and immersing compared to that using the phone and when it's very late in the night in order to leave your family members alone and reduce the disturbances we just dragged that symbol for earphones and immediately the sound will be limited to your ears only and you will not disturb your family members so currently thanks to harmony os our experience can be expanded to different devices we have applied actually two very important technologies to synchronize the picture and also the sound we have the synchronization of the soft clocks when we connect three different devices together they will respect one single unified standards of the time and another challenge is the disturbancy if there are disturbances there would be the damage to the quality of the video and also the sound in this case we have to use an algorithm that is anti-disturbancy so that is the magic behind the convenience offered to our customers and today make sure that this connection kept ability between our phone and also the smart screen to the third party suppliers this is the first step of the openness of our function i believe that in the future the potential could be further tapped the free connection has become a very popular function among our users this function with our mobile phone thanks to the existence of this super terminal we can connect the tv with our phone and next time when we do this connection a video with our friends and family members then we would see their face on the tv screen instead of only on the screen of our phones we also have realized a lot of innovations and if you take some time you can reveal one after another and if you want to take one photo and move that photo from the phone to the tablet we have to use a certain device to copy first of all this photo from the mobile phone and then move it to the tablet or you have to first upload and later download but today it's quite simple with only one move you can connect or tablet with your phone and you just use a very gentle drag and the photo would be moved from your phone to the tablet that is really efficient since we can connect the tablet with the mobile phone then you should also be curious about the possibility of connection between the mobile phone and pc of course the answer is positive we can form a super terminal between the phone and also the pc and the reason why we would enable this connection between the two sides is that we have a distributed so that it can be connected directly uh with that of our phone the file to your email then you just make the connection between your phone and also your pc and then you find the file and you upload and also you can do it in another direction you can drag something from your pc to send it by your mobile phone in your pc if you have discovered a very nice photo and you would like to keep it with your phone you just open the file the folder and find the file and then you send it to your phone today with the harmony os you could create different types of super terminals as you want we have different angles for shooting we have this distributed architecture to enable different angles of camera so you will not miss any single wonderful angle of shooting and you can also select the footage made by different angles of camera so that today there's no boundary to the photo shooting and video shooting today more and more intelligent smart devices have become a object of our daily life however today we have not yet tapped the full potential for these smart home appliances why is that because for each one of these whole appliances you have to first of all download an app before manipulating it and usually those softwares and those apps would take up a lot of room in your storage of the mobile phone and that's why people are hesitating for the utilization of those home appliances if you really would like to tap the potential of those uh whole appliances and then you have to go through the menu and choose the best option sometimes it will also be a headache for our users so today we have estimated that the utilization ratio or the installation ratio of the smart home appliances app is less than 10 and the potential has been tapped for more for less than five percent now let's have a look at the home appliances enabled by harmony os2 our ecosystem of harmony os how we can enable the connection to the internet in a very convenient way and how we can activate the application we just a mobile phone with the harmony os to have a very gentle contact with the home appliance and then it's connected with the web and later we will use the card to display all the smart functions of this home appliance for example we discover a very interesting recipe and then we will use the mixture of the ingredients and then we just put all the ingredients inside that hung appliance and then it's cooked it's a very big help to our modern life because we have such a rapid pace of life today and those home appliances they have become tailored home appliances to us it's very close to our heart and it can help to make our life easier for this rapid pace life usually we would buy a lot of food and stock them into the refrigerator and for many of our users maybe you don't know where to put those food into the refrigerator to better protect their value of nutrition so we have helped to solve this problem with that os of harmony for example first we will make a touch of the device by our mobile phone and then here we have the money of the function and you can see what is the best temperature for the protection of each type of food and beverages and immediately you can put the food to the right place and also the sour bean milk is a favorite food of the chinese people however milk we have different recipes of different proportions of the nutrition and for the juice maker of the soybean milk usually we have to run a very complicated setup in order to have the correct proportion of nutrition from the final product but today we also use our mobile phone to have a touch with our device of the cheesemaker and then we know what is the proportion of that milk coming out so today what is waiting for us is no longer a a technical box instead it's a very humane equipment that can help us to build up very good habits for healthy eating and healthy living last year since the 10th of september we have open we have this closest operating system to all the partners more and more brands of manufacturers have joined this ecosystem of harmony os so i believe that with the demonstration of different scenarios of utilization you dear customers you have already a first glance of this magnificent functions of the harmony os you know that how we can connect one piece of device with another and how we can manipulate different super terminals and also thanks to this distributed architecture today not only with your phone with the tablet with the watch you can run the same type of control center and in the future we hope that all the equipment with the screen in this system of um harmony could be equipped with such an operating system and then it will give you much more convenience in the [Music] utilization [Music] 10. [Music] and now i'm about to guide you into the second section for our customers we are quite used to using the smartphones and also for the downloading of the smart apps the apps they are very powerful with the mobile phones they can enable us to get more digital information and services it can enable the connection between the friends and family members once we have more devices joining the mobile phone and then we find that the apps will not be suitable for the whole system that is our third point of consideration when we have more connected devices to one super terminal whether we could make it possible that the developers develop only once the code we have enabled this programming architecture that is distributed so we can use them like the service this is our desktop for the current devices if they are equipped with the harmony os and also the atom services then with only one slide upwards immediately they will be displayed in front of our customers and we are using this card to display the service as the atoms for the cards they are carrying very important messages if i would like to keep the message there and if i want to keep it there and i don't want to repeat that illumination of the display screen then i would just keep it there and we can also make sure that with one desktop there is a certain scenario and with another screen we can show another display another display of the desktop for two similar apps you could drag them into one folder and at this time the system will also give you a hint to tell you that there are other similar apps that could be dragged into the same folder too and then we could also enlarge this folder and with this larger display of the files and of the apps inside you would immediately know what is inside you don't have to activate the whole page to see what is inside and also thanks to this capacity of harmony os this kind of card can be enabled not only with your phones but also with the watch and with the tablet uh wherever you go the experience is the same and now i'd like to review an even more magic experience all of our customers they are used to getting an app with the mobile phone and in today's ecosystem is the only pay it's the only place that they can get an app in that way however with harmony os the apps could also be reached elsewhere i will show you how we can break down the barriers among the softwares and the hardwares i will take the example of our phone and tablet when we combine the foam and the tablets there is a super terminal and you can check at the same time the tasks activated with the foam and tablet if i would like to shift one task from the phone to the tablet we will only use one single tab and the same mindset if i would like to drag one useful function one useful task from the tablet to the phone it can also be easily realized in today's ecosystem it's really hard for us to imagine the possibility however within the ecosystem of the harmony os it's so convenient and rapid today we are also benefiting from this super terminal to put the service to the highlight spot when you are riding a bicycle then you can shift this application to the big screen for all those procedures and experiences just with a tap and also with a drag you can realize that move now i'd like to take example of the video connection which is also based on this 18 service and distributed distribution distributed architecture you can see how it works in the world of harmony os we can make this free circulation and communication more convenience what about the devices without a screen it can also work with the harmony os you can feel really easy to tackle your tasks you are you can enjoy the service and the service will follow you wherever you go even in the midair however challenging the scenario is it can always make it we also hope that this card would be the unified carrier for the atom service it can be the unified language for the communication you don't have to install it wherever you go you just activate the service center and then all the cars would appear here and you can receive the message with the card if you need extra details of the information with only one tab you could activate the page and you could also add this one to the main page of your desktop so today more and more add-on services are combined here it has become a unified interaction carriers these cars wherever you go the cars would follow you if you have run into a news with your phone and you would like to share with your friends you will just use the car to share with your friends for the destination phone it's not necessary for them to pre-install this card service also when you take the bus you can use your phone to immediately buy the ticket and also you can show all the information with your card wherever you want to go the destination place is registered with your screen and not only with your phone but also with your watch our new type of language of communication with the harmony os with one slide you can activate the versatile card with your watch with your phone with your tablet wherever you go the performance is always there and there's no limit with our cards and the cards will make your connections easier here [Music] harmony this is our innovation based on a distributed architecture and add-on services and more and more partners have already noticed the importance and the value behind this operating system and we also would like to say thank you to them for their appreciation and recognition today we have different layers for example the layer of the core layer of the runtime layer of the hardware and also the layer of the framework of applications according to our statistics about 20 of the users after using the mobile phones for three years the rome storage room has reached its ceiling by then the system would be really slow and every step of the procedure for example if you want to activate an app or if you want to play the video game and or you want to add it a profile and this case will all produce a lot of um artifacts in to your phone and this will take up nearly all the space all the room in your mobile phone however today with the harmony os there's no need to stock all those temporary documents it's just in real time service so it means that it will not eat up all the storage room inside your phone and this time with harmony os we have used an absolute the whole system of the images we have several innovations first of all with the intelligent calculating okay tpo cpu we can combine the cpu and the cgu and for the rendering logic and also the business management logic they are separated so they will not interfere one into another for the whole fluidity of the image it can be guaranteed and third for the imaging we have used a render service so there's no overlapping imaging the load folder management of the image would be reduced all this combined the result is that you can see a better animation and also longer navigation hours with our battery for a video game with the mobile phone from with the iphone it can sustain only 3.9 hours with hours we can sit in 5.1 hours and in order to guarantee the supply of the resources on the front stage we have to block some backstage this is our past practice if i want to go back to the previously used application in this case when we go back we need to reactivate the application this is a very bad customer experience and today with the harmony os whenever we want to go back to the already the activated is going on it will not be cut and it will not be blocked and from the first day of our service to the customers we have put the privacy and safety of data of our customers on top of our agenda we have maximize the security and the protection of the security of the privacy of our customers for example multi surface and during this connection for the id of this equipment we have to round layers and layers of verification only after a positive result and response from the verification we would allow the adhesion of a another equipment today for the terminal recognition we have already reached the world-class level and the harmony os we are launching today is the first the version based on open harmony open harmony is a project of open source of an open source community only this open source manner would enable the success of the ecosystem for harmony os and i would like to welcome all of the developers and the partners to develop different versions of publications for harmony os with different devices this is what i would like to share with you about the harmony os and now i would like to give the flow to my colleague [Music] [Music] oh [Music] foreign [Applause] so [Music] [Music] two two [Music] two [Applause] [Music] [Applause] this is the harmony os just explained by dr juan with a new structure the harmony os has solved the problems for many hardwares some of them has a very small storage and some others have bigger storage and some have higher requirements for them capacity of the batteries and all in all we are using one operating system to solve multiple problems and the highlight of this is the distributed technology we can realize the seamless synchronization of different devices and this is a very big upgrade the harmony os has also enabled this all scenario atom services and we can let our experience flow today in the internet of things area we have used this card design to be the unified language excellent performance and performance of the harmony os would help us to make a big step forward compared to the previous android experience today we have better performance and more sustainable performance this is the most powerful operating system harmony os for this era of internet of things and now i'd like to give the floor to mr hooker our ceo to talk about several products that are applying this harmony os operating system [Music] i'd like to say thank you to mr you and the doctor one for your introduction about the harmony os and in order to give you the benefits of the harmony os of course we need some hardware first in 2015 we have launched the first generation of the huawei watch during that time we have stick and in 2017 we have launched the watch too and later we have waited for four years before launching a new watch the new watch suite because for the watch wine and watch tv we discovered that there are new challenges waiting for us for the performance and for the design to grow so we have spent four years in order to realize a big step forward and today we are bringing to you the brand new watch three [Music] so this is the huawei watch three we have brand new design for example this linear design there's the combination of arts and science and technology in order to give us better knowledge about this watch 3 and in order to better embed the harmony os 2 into the huawei watch 3 we have used this rotating watch surface we could also use a tab to enter our menu we could also use a very rapid tap to get into or get out of the apps so it's really convenient to use we have used the 316l stainless steel and we have also used a special technology so that it will not be easily hurt on the surface we have also polished the surface of the watch so it can give you the elegant feeling as a very high-end brand of the watch we also have the 3d curved surface screen of 1.43 amoled we have 326 ppi 1000 of the brightness and also 60 hertz of the ratio of refresh so for this product it has not only very beautiful design of the panel of the body but also we have this and now i'd like to show you how would it be like a real watch with the harmony os first of all it's a fully independent device that means even without a phone your watch can independently perform for example when there is a call coming in you don't have to grab your phone you can use your watch to take the call because it's equipped with the easing with this capacity we can stay connected with our friends on the line when you are swimming or when you're doing some sports outdoor when you're traveling outside you

later be connected with your watch and you also have a countless applications through our online app store you can download all of them so with the huawei watch 3 you can listen to music take the

Ocean ah the China only honor TV from Huawei featuring I'm just gonna put this down there hyung mang OS which at one point was rumored to be Huawei's answer to being cut off from Android note though now they've like they've walked that back they've said it's not like an Android fuchsia something I don't know we don't know what it is because I can't read anything on this so thankfully I've brought along a special friend to help me check out the honor TV and it's Hong man OS Dennis first I'm not your friend yes I can help you read this honor smart TV your flesh yes all it says why do they need so many characters for that what's up Pro oh no it's fine I get you don't you don't read English this video is brought to you by privacy comm get a brand new virtual credit card number every time you shop with privacy check out the link below and get five dollars off your first purchase it's basically free money and if anyone likes free money it's Dennis yes give me all the free money alright [Music] so this is honor smart TV Pro so our so Dennis claims so the only syllabus in China for now right no ever as far as we know okay this is all pretty visual I think I can't figure this out cut that composite cable included hi guys I got the stand but um probably because it goes like that oh oh weird the power plug doesn't have the holes so I guess that means it doesn't work with locking extension cords and stuff okay it's kind of an apple remote but like cheaper and plastic ER but wait yes honor magic link with NFC chip okay so what does that do so I mean I think you can tap this thing and then we'll secure there what kind of your phone to the TV do you want to install that on your phone oh did you just say why not this one is a 55 inch model so I just wanted to kind of show the design on the back it's actually kind of kind of an interesting shape and the i/o is weird so the power goes in here which I can't think of a good reason to do that beyond like class saving measure cuz like the power supply happens to be here no vase amount except that there's like oh yeah I know it is a vase amount so you just got a maybe put a pin in it and like pop it out so that's where we put the stand oh that's kind of nice it had a little cover for where the stand goes if you want to wall mount it oh that's the bun oh oh oh so it's just like an accent late yeah okay cool okay there we go so what do we got here three HDMI USB three keither net oh collects I guess oh it's kind of a different connector than I'm used to seeing for it and then that's a clean 1/2 millimeter Jack what is that though it's for that composite video adapter this guy right here ok cool oh you can see the integrated speakers through the grill down here so I've got three on this side another three on that side all right let's go ahead and throw it up here hey you left all these hats here LTTE store.com we've got three different colors how much of our personal information is likely to be collected in the next hour I'm not using my phone I'm doing it I like to live dangerously Hey look there's no proof they spied you can prove it later - she says nice to meet you her name's yo-yo yo-yo yo-yo yeah so basically he says you need to access your phone your written rice storage and camera and you need to why does it need my camera well there's always a lot of question about this but I think you have to say let's say agree fine I wonder I'm you're hot for your hallway device need to be you need to use some hardware guys okay I got my hands on an honor view 20 here so I'm just gonna wait for it to charge up in the meantime why don't we experience Chinese TV okay so I'll just agree jesso Korea agree with someone on the right to just agree so basically assess above a data will be transferred transit transferred and collect it to the People's Republic China's Sofer so in order to have the complete experience I need to agree to give the people trying to have to agree do you have a hallway account I actually think I do so far honestly my main comment is this is pretty similar to any other oh no what okay again it's just this device only support how it combats register in China now what so do we really need this anyway though I don't know we can try without the account yo yo yo chin content-item I am telling you the weather in Beijing nah man Cooper that was super weird why did it just gone anyhow yo yo hunger game bah oh you can only like try it you can watch 10 minutes for free but you know and then you have to like you have to link your hallway membership to watch the full version that looks like crap so this is free don't need a membership to watch it how are the hardly onboard speakers actually not too bad oh so these are just all the built-in media platforms that's why here can I borrow this for a second that's why we're actually seeing a lot of the same movies from one to another and this is cool meow I guess different platform and isn't mango TV mango TV is that Ingo TV what's mango TV so mango TV is like mid like one of the mainland television stations they do a lot of like reality shows holy crap this one has yes 75 seconds of ads wait so I have to have a membership to watch it without ads then yeah so I've got to give them credit Hong mango s is like very content centric like you fire it up and it's not like here's a bunch of random stuff here is all a whole bunch of platforms that you're may or may not be interested in so I guess I never mentioned this before this is a 4k TV I mean this content doesn't look great this is pretty little bit rate but then there was that other video that took a while to kind of take in at a higher bitrate so maybe it will eventually it's got two gigs of RAM 32 gigs of internal storage it's got their high silicon Hong whoo whatever 8:18 chips so that's two ARM Cortex a seventy threes and then two a fifty three so two high-performance to lower performance on Mally z51 GPU so you could feasibly play some cheapo android games on it I guess although I can't imagine how you get access to the Play Store the pro has the six speaker so the vision only has four and it's not a sixty Hertz refresh rate 400 nits peak brightness 94% screen the body ratio that kind of checks out and then dual band Wi-Fi you can see the bitrate did pick up on this it's still not great like you'll still see some bending and some blocking in the water but it's it's quite a bit better than it was before alright so is there anything on here that isn't just TV oh this music doesn't work that's not Chinese wait did we lose our internet connection I don't think things are loading it anymore yeah we just get kicked off no way it's all internet working here I'm working okay so let's try reconnecting again then okay okay we're back I'm not just how am I supposed to enjoy this content spongebob there's no way that's all she says I really I'm listening yes pass spongebob story yeah ever if I ever have to go to like you know an important business meeting with someone Chinese or something I'm not bringing you they want some kind of partnership agreement oh we got a Chinese wall way accounts yeah okay video call shoot a video call sure call your mom okay in the meantime let's find something that didn't work before because we didn't have a why away account this one this one are you okay whatever this is yep it's free if you have alcoholic now it's free but yeah yeah oh you have six minutes then you have to upgrade your like a premium we need to have a gold membership okay so that's like 550 US dollars per month and then what does 60 yen get you two months three months three months oh so it's a lot cheaper for 12 months is 180 yeah but that's the same no it's none of things yes it is times for its 2020 month so times four oh I've thought of times three see the math here Wow even though I cannot do translate I can do math what so that's like 25 bucks a year okay that's pretty cheap okay so why don't we dig into the settings menu a little bit now that's standard mode why would you tell me at the standard mode how am I just one to four yeah okay so one picture mode I can't read it Victor don't be like oh press contrast this is so much easier than getting you to do it Dennis I'm just using bixby vision and it's like there we go dynamic contrast yeah you're out of a job dynamic contrast dynamic backplate and it's noise reduction gamma correction dynamic picture compensation now let's find out what these settings are I want to try one more thing to see if I can remove smooth motion cuz if you can't do that at all that would be horrible that's off okay let's try that oh no it's better okay wow it's a lot better okay big breakthrough guys Dennis check it out with Andy's account we were able to get into the app to control the TV with with our smartphone yeah with specifically a wall weight or honor smartphone you can't use a third party one still for example in the Apple II have the controller and all those like they out here we can see it does click the control and see oh you have to look at it while doing it yeah oh that's so you drag it you track it yeah and then stop and click oh that is a horrible interface that's the worst is that you have see your phone's lock right yeah you tap it like you're controlling also your remote so the point is you like stick this on your like remote buddies on your table or your whatever your coffee table or something and then you just put throw your phone on there and it's like okay now mode you adjust think of this right yeah look planus look how cool is that you can change different is easier oh that is way better okay this is it okay stupid go to any shows like okay let's go back to Avengers so it's kinda like the chromecast anycast to your phone now so you can't or your phone now it cap it ain't change on the TV look Linus you are controlling oh cool oh that is pretty cool you can adjust the bone here well the TV yeah yeah or oh nice that is pretty cool I mean I can't think of a reason that I would oh I guess I could get my headphone jack yeah and if someone's sleeping you can watch that and another thing now we can see the camera oh nice hey nice see the camera pop oh nice shirt Andy LGD store calm calm that's that's pretty cool image quality is actually not bad like when you consider how crappy like a laptop webcam is like this is more like a foam selfie cam like it actually looks fine you know obviously blown up this big it looks kind of Garbo but like it's good enough oh oh good that's useful you can only open a camera on the control so he can recruit someone Oh interesting they're not creepy at all Neha yo-yo lied are you yeah what is that both on the eager yo-yo I still have to get up and reach the remote conclusion wise honestly it's more polished than I expected quite frankly like it's got a ton of features but it's also still way behind in a number of ways like when it comes to third-party app support as well as just the overall fit and finish of things like the integrated digital assistant although that last one in particular is something that we've certainly seen before I've got to give them credit for having a massive amount of content just and like content that people would probably actually care about just like baked right into the TV the minute you fire it up as well as the very affordable streaming service especially if you buy the year-long subscription but overall as a North American I don't really feel like I'm missing out on a whole lot but hey if you're

have that link below so thanks for watching guys even you Chinese government thank you for watching see you in the next video [Music] [Music] [Music] it's 2021 and we can think our day without google android or apple ios and surprisingly harm in eos yes huawei operating system coming to smartphones in asia [Music] not only asia later this year it will cover first world countries over the world aside from the geopolitics no company has successfully taken on a mobile os duopoly now dominated by google's android and apple's ios system a battleground littered with the likes of play modes including blackberry microsoft's windows phone and the amazon fire device [Music] nearly 100 different huawei products are set to support harmony os and china this year [Music] huawei had previously said 300 million devices will run on harmony os this year this harmony os truly gonna boom in china this year two operating systems dominate the mobile market today google's android and apple's ios in the past [Music] companies from microsoft to samsung have tried and failed to create viable alternatives but huawei has put a big focus on apps and the company's skill and the number of devices harmony os can work across could help draw developers to the platform harmony os could attract the developer ecosystem and increase the install base of devices really fast more developers will see the benefits there is not a check-in and a problem as different types of files and other content could be passed between phones tablets tvs and computers with these by using its unified harmony os system which leads to a whole new huawei ecosystem but there is some problems both companies also have a huge base of app developers and the world's most popular apps on their platform that is one area in which huawei could struggle huawei's app store is missing major names such google apps which are important to users abroad facebook meanwhile is available but not for direct download from app gallery some certain continents like europe and africa could provide an opportunity for huawei however the chinese firm will most likely have to deal with the reputational fallout from us sanctions well this will not be a big problem for this giant chinese company if they throw money at it it will be solved itself so we could easily bring the conclusion that in near future we are google is losing its palate and apple will lose its dignity and harmony os and huawei will be the next cat giant [Music] peace [Music] so [Music] with [Music] in some ways the Huawei p30 pros camera system is completely groundbreaking let's get into it okay guys welcome to maybe the most exciting smartphone camera comparison of the entire year but before with a 30 Pro Galaxy S Templars and the other antennas Max and let me know which smartphone microphone you think sounds better so we recording for key video from the rear cameras and weirdly enough hallways P 30 Pro doesn't support 4k video at 60 frames per second so we recording at 30 on all of them now one of the most exciting things about this new Huawei flagship is it's 5 times optical zoom and honestly I had to see it to believe it all three of these phones have optical image stabilization on the telephoto lenses so even when you're zoomed in this much the footage is generally pretty stable but you really start to see the differences when you go to 10 times you can clearly read the text on the Eiffel Tower I am standing so far away at this point and on the other two phones that's quite apparent for a point of reference the iPhone tennis max footage is the closest to reality in terms of colors the STM plus is very similar with a slightly puncher aesthetic and it looks good then you've got the Huawei P 30 Pro which has basically established an entirely new color palette of its own it's not necessarily bad it's just different for this shot here I put all three phones on a tripod and I wanted to show high dynamic range this is a really good example of how the iPhone tennis max HDR is still yet to be beaten it has managed to control that super bright Sun a lot better than the STM plus which in itself has done it better than the hallway now you can also shoot video in ultra wide or at least you can on the Huawei and the Samsung and it's such a cool feature to be able to get that extra perspective but what you will notice is that especially in video Samsung's ultra wide captures so much more ultra wide are definitely the right words to describe it I'm happy to say that all three smartphones have stellar stabilization here I'm walking in 4k resolution and the Samsung is lagging a little bit behind but nonetheless all three do a pretty good job and there's no weird distortion effects that we've seen on previous flagships but things get really exciting when you bring that down to 1080p this is when Samsung's super teddie video mode kicks in and that elevates it quite away above the iPhone but then who always p30 pro combines artificial intelligence stabilization with optical image stabilization and the results are crazy I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like it this is quite possibly the best smartphone stabilization to date one of the things that I've really enjoyed about the last few Huawei flagships are these AI video modes things like AI color of being able to colorize the foreground and make black and white the background and they work better on this phone than ever before I just wish they'd added a few more now whoa is slightly weaker dynamic range in video is really apparent here the p30 Pro does control the bright areas in the sky better than the Samsung but you can also see that almost crushes the blacks the general image just looks dark definitely darker than it should be whereas the iPhone in particular looks quite balanced I'm happy to say though this changes in low-light and the hallway becomes a bit of a beast of its own its image is a little too warm but the detail is miles above the other two phones and green is lower bear in mind that on the p30 pro and the s10 plus you do also have the option to use the ultra wide for nighttime video and it is great to have the option but you'll probably never use it because the quality takes a complete nosedive back to the main camera though the Huawei it manages to consistently produce far less grain than the Samsung and a much brighter picture than the iPhone making it the best smartphone I've ever tested for low-light video and things are about to get a lot better so just before we dive into photography this is the setup I was using and there's a couple of things worth pointing out about the smartphone's we're dealing with the iPhone has two cameras a wide-angle and telephoto the STM plus then dollz assert by adding in an ultra wide lens on top of that and then the p30 Pro has not just five times optical zoom versus two but also adds a fourth camera the time of flight which should mean much better portrait mode so let's find out first things first the p30 Pro has V best night time shots of any smartphone I've ever used providing you use the night mode and you're happy told the phone's steady for four to six seconds the results are sharper brighter and generally cleaner than the comp tition as with my video the general trend here is that the s10 plus is little grainy the iPhone is a little dark and although it does look a little processed and over sharpened the p30 pro leads the pack also whilst having to hold the phone still for a few seconds to take a nighttime shot can be a bit of a pain and it can mean that moving objects like cars are blurred this doesn't seem to happen any more often than on the other two phones they too have to keep their camera shutter open for a long time at night to let more light in but they don't have the night mode software to cope with it you can also use night mode whilst zooming in so if we take this scene zoom in five times you can see that Wally preserves the texture of objects much better and to the untrained eye it's not even obvious that it's nearly pitch black in this scene okay this right here is one of my favorites you see that Eiffel Tower way off in the distance well if we use that ten times hybrid zoom on the Huawei combined with night mode the result is leagues ahead of the other two flagships it's almost funny you can also use the ultra wide cameras on the Huawei and the Samsung at night and the results are better than when trying to take an ultra wide video but there's still a noticeable degradation in quality versus the primary camera all right this is when my jaw practically hit the floor this is the inside of my hotel room at night with no lights on I could barely see and the iPhones image is about the best way I can describe how dark it was samsung's bright night mode did activate here and it's brighter but less sharp than the iPhone but the Huawei completely blew me away I remember when the company was announcing this phone and they talked about how it's more sensitive to light than even full-size DSLRs and I was skeptical but this really is the real deal the flush quality is good on all three but I did find that Samsung doesn't color correct so well when it's relying on the flash only to light the subject and its images have a slightly green tinge to them all right so when you're out and about in the daytime man you're just shooting standard photos all three are amazing great detail punchy colors and the ability to deal with all kinds of harsh lighting the main difference you'll see is just in the ability to handle dynamic range and in this aspect the iPhone is still slightly ahead I do like the darker shadows that high-contrast look you get on the two Android phones but there are some situations quite a lot of situations where the iPhone prevents overexposure but the other two kind of struggle don't underestimate the zoom on this new Huawei phone in fact it's even more potent for photography than it is for video and you can get super clean images even at ten times zoom where the other two phones are effectively crippled you can clearly read text on buildings way into the distance and I've actually used this phone's camera as a telescope a couple of times already just to read signs that are too far away which I know it sounds like something straight out of a commercial also the ultra wide cameras on the hallway and the Samsung they shine in broad daylight you don't have any of those noise problems you get in low-light and notice again the s10 if it's a good deal more in the shot than even the Huawei Apple is crying in a corner at this point but then when you jump over to portrait mode you've got to hand it to Apple it's a little annoying that it uses the telephoto lens so you have to take a step back or you end up getting this super close-up photo but the results are consistently cinematic and the background blur you get is easily the most natural you might also find that the two androids in portrait mode tend to crush the blacks you lose detail in my beard my hair my black jacket whereas you can quite easily see that stuff in the iPhone remember though the p30 Pro now has that fourth camera the time of flight and this is one of the areas where it kicks in when it comes to edge detection the p30 Pro is a leap above the p20 Pro and it now makes even fewer errors than the s 10 plus if you wanted to try portrait mode at a night time then it actually holds up reasonably well it's a little more vulnerable to overexposure and some of the brighter parts of the image but not bad at all really the Huawei P 30 Pro has yet another trick that no one's really talking about macro it can get so close to subjects and still retain focus on them this is followed by the s 10 Plus which can also get pretty close and then the iPhone which really struggles to get too close at all what about detail what about if you just wanted to take a shot and be able to blow it up to as larger size as you want it well the p30 Pro can shoot 40mm pixel images versus 12 on the s10 plus an iPhone tennis max to be honest though a little underwhelming this sensor needs perfect lighting conditions to really get good results and without it you're probably better off with the STM plus the actual 12 megapixel sensor is capturing more detail Samsung also wins when it comes to the front camera video the STM plus can record at 4k resolution four times the number of pixels of the other two that's not to say it's image is four times better and this is definitely not the best 4k video you're ever gonna see but my vote would go with Samsung overall for this the p30 pro has better stabilization but I like how Samsung can shoot video at a really wide angle versus the other two front camera photos or selfies are probably the most subjective part of this comparison some people prefer Beautification others prefer pin drop accuracy you can't really please ever on what I can say is that the tennis max has the most consistent and the most balanced colors and wali has the crispiest selfies as you'd expect given it's 32 megapixels sensor they can all shoot portraits southeast too but the s 10 plus with its specialized depth sensor does by far the best job not just out of these three phones but any smart phone I've ever tested it also copes much better in low light versus the other two which quickly become super dark and super soft looking you do get the option for front flush on all three using the display to light your face and the p30 Pro definitely benefits the most from this it kind of needs this light to perform well I'm a bit disappointed with huawei's slow-motion situation this is a 2019 flagship and yet if you want to record slow-motion at 1080p the maximum frame rate is 120 frames per second the other two can record 1080p at 240 so they can record footage that is twice as slow if you do want to record 240 frames per second on the wall way you can but at 720p resolution which doesn't hold a candle to the other two phones it is nice that you can shoot bursts of super slow-mo of like on the Samsung but the s10 wins in terms of quality or way is using some sort of software interpolate to reach this 960 FPS limit and you can kind of tell so which phone do you think won if you enjoyed this video it had been massively appreciated if you could subscribe to the channel plenty more coverage on this phone and other phones coming very soon as always thank you so much for watching my name is Aaron this is mr. who's the boss and I'll catch you in the next one [Music] you despite some issues with its smartphones huawei is dropping yet more wearables with the watch 3 which as it turns out after a week of usage is pretty impressive but let's dive in thanks for watching 95 google here on youtube remember to thumbs up hit subscribe and then tap the bell icon to be among the first to watch our upcoming videos give me a round watch face and i'm usually pretty happy the huawei watch 3 is a round faced watch and it's expertly crafted and the design is fairly inconspicuous exactly how what should be at least in my opinion it is far from perfect though but this is a solid and well made smartwatch at least when you first get out of the box there is a ridged rotating side dial and flat macro button on the right side with no other hardware keys cluttering what is a fairly seamless build there is a speaker that is hidden from view on the right side of the chassis which allows you to take and place calls or even listen to music if you really want to although i would suggest avoiding the latter audio can get loud but it is tinny compared to your smartphone speaker or even a pair of earbuds which you can pair with this smartwatch another big bonus here is the usage of a regular strap as it's just much more comfortable than some of the flap style options we see from other manufacturers such as fitbit i have to say the entire package is assured despite a multitude of issues in the software stakes it's really hard to be majorly negative with the look and feel of the watch 3. it is genuinely outright exceptional the dial is backed by lovely haptic vibration when scrolling while the macro button is just the right side of mushy and clicky when you do depress it the display at 1.43 inches on the watch 3 is what i consider fairly large for a smartwatch and about the very limit of what i'd consider for comfort it is genuinely very good too and it's sharp at 326 ppi while the thousand knit max brightness means there are hardly any issues when viewing in direct or bright sunlight at times i actually thought that the display was faster than the 60 hertz maximum refresh rate touted but this is probably more down to the software and the hardware is tuned and it makes the overall package feel a little bit snappier as a result of this tuning as well a big bonus is that the display is completely flat which is great for usability and while it has taken some abuse in the short week that i've had the watch 3 it has held up really really well display though is really let down by the lack of good watch faces on offer i think huawei needs to up the selection and quality of the free options as the watch 3 doesn't appear to have any majorly standout options that you can choose or ones that i feel i can stick with there are a few okay options and i'm sure for most people that will be absolutely fine so one of the headline additions and we've heard a lot about is the supposed homebrew harmony os but it's not clear upon the first usage how it differs from android that huawei is set to leave behind the chinese firm is leaning heavily into the idea of a wider ecosystem here but if you have no plan to pick up a huawei smartphone or any other huawei devices something we actually actively suggest you don't do unless you're happy side loading or dealing with certain issues then i think this is not going to affect your daily usage too drastically the general performance levels are genuinely excellent it actually shocked me how good they were and it's smoother than most other wear os devices that i've ever reviewed i really didn't expect harmony os nor the warwick watch 3 to offer such a smooth experience it's snappy animations are crisp and absolute fairly quickly granted they're not a lot of apps that you can use or that you will be using beyond the default options and they'll cover most of what most people need that said it does come powered by the lte capable high 6262 chipset and 2 gigabytes of ram with 16 gigabytes of onboard storage also included so there's plenty of space if you do want to delve into the app gallery and choose from the fairly limited selection available there of third-party applications you can also choose between an app grid or traditional list layout view when tapping the dial button although i have never used an apple watch it looks eerily similar to how the watch os handles its own app grid being able to pinch and zoom in and out is a really nice way to navigate all of your installed apps without scrolling endless lists and menus that said you can have a list menu if you choose so a limitation though of this version of harmonyos is that some notifications you'll get on your wrist lose the interactive elements that are associated with wear os and something that i do prefer if like me though you do use a smartwatch mainly as an extension of your smartphone only for things like fitness tracking and reminders to check or pick up emails and messages on your smartphone then this probably is going to be absolutely fine for you however it might be frustrating if you're the complete opposite you'll need to decide just what you're willing to give up here before you make the decision to pick it up another notable is the nfc is also included but without google pay or a supported wireless payment app in your region it's not going to be much use unfortunately and it is a big bug bear as for fitness modes huawei touts over 100 workout modes including tracking for 17 core activities with a further 85 custom workout modes that you can tailor to your own levels those custom workout modes cover a heck of a lot of really niche sports and activities including even things like archery belly dancing and random things like laser tag i'm not really sure many of these qualify as a traditional workout but you can track them if you really want to the data is showcased in activity circles that will sync with certain watch faces on the watch itself it's lifted or it looks as though it's lifted directly from the apple watch but it does give you a nice clear visual indicator of your activity through any given day does it make me want to feel those rings i'm not so sure about increasing my urge to move but it's easy to decipher what each ring represents at a glance other notable fitness tracking features include an spo2 sensor that has sort of become standard on just about any smartwatch worth its sold in recent times especially since the start of the pandemic what's more interesting to me though is a skin temperature sensor which can supposedly help probe further into your overall health picture i'm honestly not so sure about how this helps but i suppose it's one of those nice to haves on the watch 3. huawei touts a 3 day battery life on the watch 3 but i can't honestly say that i've managed to attain such lofty lifespan goals two days is pretty much a piece of cake though in no way would i say the watch 3 is a battery beast but it is a pretty solid performer when compared to much of the wear os competition i found that i had to charge once every couple of days when i enabled the always on display feature but there was a significant uplift in the lifespan when this was disabled i do like the charger itself as it works no matter how you attach it to the back of the watch three sometimes smartwatches can have annoyances about how you line up that charging cable but it is magnetic and it works in any direction which means you can seat it how you see fit in my experience it takes around two hours or just over to go from dead to 100 capacity which i think is in line with most wearables that i would use on a regular basis so all in all i think it's really tough to even suggest that someone goes out and picks up a huawei smartphone but the firm's headphone and wearable lines are pretty much fair game i'll go so far as to say as i think the huawei watch 3 is probably the only huawei ecosystem device worth considering right now it's as good as the tick watch pro 3 which was my favorite werewolf watch of last year in terms of overall daily wear lifespan and performance which is a real standout performer itself within the google back to wear os ecosystem where it falters is in the extended access and interactivity with your favorite apps right there on your wrist of course it will depend heavily on whether you want or need access to apps like gmail on your arm or if you really need to be able to make mobile payments with apps like google pay that said you will have to decide if that is enough of a reason to even consider this for those reasons alone i mean i think it is still a tough sell but this is a very good smartwatch that isn't quite as inhibited by the lack of google play services access as a smartphone ever would be because it's more likely to be tethered to your wrist it doesn't seem to suffer the same fate as the p series and mate series smartphones and that's probably all you need to hear but with that said let us know what you think of the huawei watch 3 down in the comments section below is it a no-go or is it something you would consider picking up and would you even consider a non-wear os smart watch if you are an android user as always though this is damien with 95 google so thanks for watching and i will speak to you later you to build a 5g network you need a new type of telecoms gear you need many more base stations and they need to be smarter it is the Chinese tech company Huawei which makes the most advanced 5g gear this has been making Western governments nervous so I've come to find out who are who are we it may look like Paris but this is huawei's brand new campus in Shenzhen China a huge site where employees take a train between office buildings each of which is modeled on a different European city few journalists have visited this Disney World like projects very much the brainchild of run Jung PHA the company's founder he's been compared to the likes of Steve Jobs growing his company from a small workshop to a global tech giant now employing a hundred and eighty thousand people huge spending on research means Huawei claim they're now around eighteen months ahead of any other 5g manufacturer and that includes not just getting faster and faster data speeds but also dealing with the problems that come from higher performance since this is so far with 5g wireless base stations tsunami you found genes Aparri surrounds one Sullins watch and how much bigger is that than a 4G base station I think in 4G base station normally it's an average of power it's a 300 watt 300 yes so it's three times larger so this chain is three turns much power yeah so it gets water yeah it's much hotter it's a common problem in technology as things get faster and they can see more power they get hotter and new cooling techniques need to be developed this is a lucrative cooling cycle in yes Baba so if that is boiling and then coming here they're learning how different designs and materials can change the speed and direction that heated air flows away from the components and here's an experiment to try and keep everything at a stable temperature by either applying heat or cold on-demand yeah that's hot Huawei is currently enjoying huge success with revenues last year in excess of a hundred billion dollars but this is also a company facing some serious issues the biggest is that the u.s. is coming for Hawaii in a big way look we have met the enemy and it is Huawei and it is China make no doubt about that you know right now loo Huawei through access to unlimited capital from the Chinese government the communist government all of this technology guess what its built-in for cyber spying for cyber espionage because that's what the Chinese do the problem is mister run was once a member of China's People's Liberation Army and that's raised suspicions about his links to the Chinese state and whether it and Huawei may have each other's backs America is adamant that Huawei is a pawn of the Chinese authorities in 2017 China passed the National Intelligence law which says that they've asked all Chinese companies and citizens must help the government to assist national intelligence efforts China claims this is part of an effort to safeguard its security but the fear is that if Huawei supplies any countries 5g network the Chinese could exploit it to help the government decide whether Hawaii should be in the UK's 5g network the British security services have a special unit devoted to looking at the potential risks posed by Huawei it's overseen by dr. Ian Levy his job is to defend the UK against digital attacks he rarely gives interviews does Huawei pose more of a security risk than the other companies that supply the network infrastructure so I think what we're talking about is assuming the Chinese state wants to attack the UK telecoms networks our job is to try and make them work just as hard regardless about whether we use iviews while we kill not many people think the Chinese state would love to eavesdrop on other countries so if we let Huawei into 5g is that a real danger it's no more likely to have spying on communications in 5g than it is in 4G and anything that's critical whether it's government business even personal communications should be encrypted so you know all of the communications with your bank from your smartphone they're all encrypted because you don't want to trust the Wi-Fi and them and the telecoms network so someone's listening on the line they'll just get a gobble there yep gobbledygook yep and it's the same for critical stuff in business in government in control systems so according to GCHQ the threat of spying that we've heard so much about recently is overblown but there is another threat that they take very seriously in a future where our entire infrastructure our economy and our lives are run by computers talking to each other over a 5g network what would happen if someone shot not Network down if you think about it the future of warfare is not necessarily going to be using traditional armies in the way that we think of like with the Second World War the future of warfare is most likely going to be cyber so without firing a shot you could take a country out it's feared that the Chinese state could order Huawei to build secret backdoors in a 5g network these would leave the country vulnerable to a nationwide cyber attack and that could be catastrophic what's up every kitten right here so huawei is gearing up for its big harmony operating system event for june 2. the company has already previously teased the huawei watch 3 a new m pencil and a mate pad tablet ahead of the event and now they teased something surprising yes the company has officially teased the huawei p50 series so here is the poster while the poster shows two circular camera bumps at an angle and according to a report by gsm arena the huawei p50 series is expected to pack a one inch sony imx 800 sensor making it one of the biggest smartphone camera sensors on the market and also it clearly shows the big thing harmony operating system well this headline indicates that the huawei p50 series will come with harmony operating system out of the box and you know what the chinese tech giant has major plans for its android alternative with a goal to have it running on 300 million devices by the end of the year some part of that massive figure will surely come from brand new devices cells because huawei will introduce bunch of new devices including a pop-up camera smartphone tv and all of the products will run harmony operating system out of the box so surely a lot of harmony operating products will help huawei to reach 300 million devices by the end of the year well we know that the star of the show on huawei's event will be harmony operating system because it's the big thing and now through some industry sources we know the very first batch of mobile devices to get harmony operating system update right after the event now these devices includes the huawei mate 4e mate 48 pro made for a pro plus mate 40 rs mate x2 nova 8 and the nova 8 pro and obviously the huawei mate pad pro so these devices will end up getting harmony operating system update soon after the june 2. and don't worry as i told you huawei will give harmony operating system update to more than 300 million devices by the end of the year so surely your huawei phone will get this update for sure so yeah what do you think about this massive news well let me know in the comments down below and if you found this video interesting then except the channel will be mind blowing for me so as always i'll catch you guys in the next one peace out up guys chigz here from chigz tech reviews [Music] so today i bring you a brand new head to head flagship smartwatch comparison between the new huawei watch 3 pro elite versus the previous huawei watch gt2 pro so straight away i'll put the specs on the screen to give you guys an insight of what we are working with so the green text shows the same features red will show you the differences so you can pause the video now if you want to read but i will be showing this again later in the video so let's begin with the prices the new huawei watch 3 pro elite is currently priced 549 on the official huawei website now the hawaii watch gt2 pro is selling for 229 on the official site so it looks like the new watch 3 pro elite is more than double in price but how better is it than the gt2 pro and are you really getting your money's worth well we shall certainly find out in this video so we are going to start off with the physical differences so side by side pro elite is 48 millimeters in diameter versus millimeters on the gt2 pro not a lot between them if you look at them side by side they look like the same size i guess there's a difference of only two millimeters so not a big difference but the build quality the pro elite is made from a titanium watch case you've got a if i can show you you've got a ceramic back and sapphire glass on the front it's 14 millimeters in thickness and weighs a good 108 grams with the straps on the gt2 pro also has a titanium watch case with ceramic back and sapphire glass on the front but it's only 11.4 millimeters in thickness and it weighs 66 grams so gt2 pro slightly smaller in dimensions thickness and it's also much lighter so this is how both watches look on my wrist now i have a wrist circumference of seven inches and you can see the gt2 pro fits nicely it's not too heavy not too big or thick but the pro elite has that bulk to it you can see it sticks out considerably um due to that thickness it's certainly the heavier watch but you are getting that slightly bigger display but somehow it still manages to be quite comfortable on the wrist in fact both watches feel very nice on the wrist and that's thanks to that ceramic back now both watches have two buttons on the side so you can see the gt2 pro have two round buttons and the pro elite actually has that wonderful 3d rotating crown which i am quite frankly a fan of i almost wish i could pull this off and stick it onto that watch and that would be quite amazing now loudspeaker locations are also in the same place in the bottom right side just under the buttons so looking at the bottom of both watches we have our sensors and both watches do support all-day heart rate sensor sbo2 monitoring but the elite pro also has a temperature sensor both watches also support wireless charging so you can drop it on any wireless charger and it does take just over 90 minutes for a full charge but real-time battery performance is different now with all health monitoring on the elite pro will give you two whole days of battery life however with everything on gt2 pro will give you a good 14 days battery life now the elite pro also has a battery saving mode and to get to it you go to settings you scroll down to battery swipe up and then you'll see the ultra long battery saving mode and if you activate it it says it will give you 19 days and eight hours left based on how much battery i have remaining and i'm going to switch on the battery saving mode just to show you what to expect so there you go that's the battery saving mode so it basically turns off the harmony os and it switches to what looks like the same huawei lite os or at least similar to the light os then you can achieve up to 21 days battery life and it still allows you to track all your health with all the health sensors active just the internet related stuff will no longer work in this ultra battery saving mode now the gt2 pro does not have a battery saving mode as the standard os is pretty efficient and it will give you a good 14 days battery life as standard now we also have a whole bunch of different watch faces in both watches and the watch face quality has slightly improved in the new elite pro with more complications and options to customize those watch faces so you do have newly designed and better looking watch faces in the elite pro now let's talk about the wrist straps now the elite pro is the flagship model it comes with the titanium straps they are easy to remove and replace with any 22 millimeter band and as you can see you've got a very beautiful finish huawei logo engraved there easy to remove and replace there's one button there you press it you can pull it off and if you need to adjust the size you've got these tags which can be removed just by pushing down on those buttons and then releasing those clips and you can adjust the size accordingly and in the box you also get a pair of silicon straps again easy to remove and replace with any 22 millimeter band and of course silicon is more water friendly now the gt2 pro comes with leather straps finished in gray and again 22 millimeter band easy to replace and remove with your own strap and they both use the same size strap so you could remove the gt2 straps and stick it on the elite just to see how it looks and you know what i am about to do this and as you can see i've just swapped them around so the gt2's leather strap is on the pro elite and i can't say it looks any better but the titanium straps on the gt2 pro looks insane that looks really nice that looks so nice that i just want to put this on just wear this watch for a second wow that feels really good impressed very impressive now both smart watches are also 5 atm certified so you can go swimming and you can track your swimming stats including strokes distance calories etc all right now both watches support always on display and i'll show you how to get to them because it's slightly different on both so find your settings open up settings on both watches now in the gt2 pro it's quite straightforward go to display and then you'll see always on display but on the elite pro if you go to display you're not going to find it there i'll show you it's not there at all you actually have to go into watch face and launcher and over there you will see always on display so if we just tap that accept and now you're selecting the always-on display so let's just select this one for example on the gt2 pro so that's always on now active and the elite pro you can also choose various different styles and i'll try and choose the same one you have exactly the same choices so i'm going to select the same one on both a matching aod style will be used when the screen turns off watch faces that don't have a matching style we use the default style the default can be customized otherwise the always-on display will match um the existing watch face so you can see what happened there it matched the existing watch face if we switch watch faces to something else so say if we switch to the karate one we let that time out and you can see what's happened there so you saw it was based on the its own theme i'll show you a few aods see that aod is now active and you can see it follows the theme so when the theme can't be followed then it will use the default which is neon lights which should look like this but you can see every single one has been followed perfectly fine so far let's uh try something like this wow that's actually quite a nice aod right there so a more advanced always on display system on the elite pro than what you're getting on the gt2 pro now i do want to point out that the gt2 pro also does support downloading apps now you don't have a proper app store instead through the huawei health app you have an app section and you have a handful of apps that you can basically install on the watch and you can see these are very basic apps there is nothing like strava or spotify or even facer or watchmaker so very very simple apps and this app list has not grown for many months now i've not seen anything new in this so very limited support they tried to add app support but it's not being done well however in the new model you are getting a dedicated app store again the app list is very limited but it definitely should be easier for developers to produce apps for this watch very soon we should be seeing a lot of the top apps come to this smartwatch and that is what i'm waiting for and when that does happen i will be covering that in another video that was the physical differences out the way now let's talk about the specs the pro elite has a 1.43 inch amoled display with 326 pixels per inch and a resolution of 466 by 466 supporting always on display and sapphire glass on top the gt2 pro has a slightly smaller 1.39 inch amoled display with a higher 426 pixels per inch and a screen res of 454 by 454 and it also has sapphire glass on top so side by side 1.43 inches versus 1.39 inches doesn't look like a huge difference now the pro elite has a brand new chipset which is not even mentioned on the official site so it's powered by the high silicon 6262 chipset but not much info about it but you do also get two gigs of ram and 16 gigs of internal storage and the gt2 pro is powered by the kiran a1 with only 32 megabytes of ram that's right people i just said 32 megabytes of ram and 4 gigs of internal storage now the elite pro supports 2 gigahertz wi-fi nfc bluetooth 5.2 and a 5 satellite gps the gt2 pro on the other hand has no wi-fi no nfc but does support bluetooth 5.1 and has a triple satellite gps the elite pro is running harmony os which is a full featured smart watch os including app store third party app support with full health tracking and some great looking menus and navigation experience and you also have a full voice assistant called cilia now the gt2 pro is running huawei light os which is very basic in functionality it has no app store no third-party support this software is really just designed to be a smart fitness tracker and also there is no voice assistant included in this watch now all the health features seem to be nearly the same if not exactly the same you've got all-day heart rate sensor all-day sp02 blood monitoring you've got automatic sleep monitoring including daytime naps you've got automatic workout detection on both now both do support bluetooth phone calls directly on the watch you have automatic stress monitoring and lots of built-in exercise options but the elite pro has an extra feature called skin temperature detection other than that all the health features are exactly the same on both smart watches now i can't confirm if the sensors are the same or if we have upgraded sensors but what i can do is test the accuracy of those sensors all right so i haven't done this before with two watches at the same time but we're going to try anyway so here is my medical grade o2 ring which detects both heart rate and spo2 levels at the same time and wear it on my thumb and you will see it will work its magic straight away and this is medical grade accuracy now we're going to see how close to medical grade both of these are and that should give us an idea if the senses are the same let's see what happens so 97 blood oxygen and 97 heart rate you can see there and the percentage shows the blood oxygen so beginning with this watch i think we're gonna have to do this at the same time to be honest so open up the heart rate on both all right here we go the o2 ring shows a heart rate of 93 beats per minute we've got 96 and 97 on both 95 on the elite pro it seems like the elite pro is a little bit more accurate if we compare it to the o2 ring so ultra ring 95 elite pro 95 so it does look like we've got upgraded sensors i mean we're not far off with the gt2 pro gt2 pro is still uh pretty close to accuracy uh but the elite pro is the closest all right so that pro which seems to be a bit slower again giving an indication of much faster health tracking on the new watch so it's giving a 99 it gave 100 and then it dropped to 99. um quickly press the button on the ring which times out every 30 seconds to save battery so 97 is what we got on the o2 medical grade standard um elite pro 98 and 99 so they're all quite close together it does seem like we have slightly faster health sensors but the results are appearing quicker and a little bit more accurate in the elite pro all right next question is what about ios well both of these smart watches work fully on android smartphones you can be connecting to more or less any android smartphone with full functionality however both smart watches also support iphones and you'll be pleased to know that all the health features work absolutely fine on ios so bluetooth calls also works on ios on both smartwatches the only limitation on ios is you cannot purchase the paid watch faces uh so if you saw my full review of the elite pro you would see that there's a whole bunch of watch faces that you can buy instead in the ios app you get you get a whole bunch of uh free downloadable watch faces um and no paid option so definitely a plus point there i am going to be doing a full ios review soon for the leap pro so do stay tuned for that so those were the physical and specs compared but realistically which watch is better for you so this is how they both look on my wrist and if you're wondering i have a wrist circumference of 7 inches the elite pro has a bigger screen bigger in dimensions it's thicker and slightly heavier the gt2 pro is certainly more compact in comparison slimmer and lighter now wearing both on my wrist the elite pro definitely feels a lot more heavier uh than the gt2 pro now the link pro has some advanced features like the app gallery so you can download third-party apps but i think huawei has jumped the gun with the release date as there are no real big name apps that you can download so no strava no spotify and no no google apps in fact the elite pro also has nfc built in but you cannot make nfc payments yet as there is no app for it natively and you cannot download one yet from the app store now drop detection and sos alerts is coming via a firmware update late june so you have all of these advanced features in the elite pro but realistically you cannot make use of them yet so if we compare the features of what can be used uh on both of these watches then technically they are exactly the same same health features same bluetooth calls the extra features you're getting on the elite pro is basically the rotating 3d crown the e sim support the skin temperature monitoring and celia voice assistant is also new otherwise using the elite on a day-to-day basis i can't actually do anything extra on this at the moment apart from the three or four things i mentioned that i cannot do on the gt2 pro yes there is potential there you have full smartwatch features but they have not yet been utilized this is early stage for the elite pro and the new watch 3 series is set to release on the 16th of june firmware updates are expected and new features can be dropped at any time now what i do like is huawei have created the watch 3 series as a smartwatch with all the right ingredients in place we just have to wait and see how huawei cooks those ingredients via firmware updates they have the potential of making the watch 3 series the best and the most successful smartwatch in the world but it won't happen without better software support so huawei really needs to pull out their wallet and start paying those developers to port over all of those major and popular smartwatch apps so if you already have the gt2 pro and considering to upgrade i would actually wait a bit for a few more updates to drop to see if we actually get the better functionality otherwise if you buy this now you may not see the difference between the elite pro and the gt2 pro that you're already using my personal feeling and experience is i absolutely love the watch i love harmony os i love the direction that huawei are taking this in but i have to say i think they need to slow down get the big developers on board launch all the third-party apps then you will see the difference in this product and how useful it can be otherwise the product will seem inferior than it actually is but that is also the only way you can justify being priced similar to the samsung galaxy watch 3 or apple watch now remember the apple watch and the galaxy watches they have the full featured apps third party app supports amongst so many other features and people complain about the battery life but this is a full featured smart watch and a full featured smartwatch with wi-fi bluetooth nfc payments along with third-party app downloads and much much more we'll always consume more battery so two to three day battery on the galaxy watch three um two-day battery on this fully featured smartwatch but this is not a full-featured smartwatch this is a fitness tracker but a very premium fitness tracker it will do the fitness parts really well but you will not get any of those smart features and of course some of us don't need those extra smart features so this might be enough for your own needs it depends what you're looking for in a smart watch me personally for my own use i need a full featured smartwatch and this is my daily driver at the moment the galaxy watch 3 slim light everything works lots of apps for whenever you need them it's a brilliant watch now i hope you found this comparison useful and i hope it gives you a better insight between these two flagship smartwatches now i must admit i am a fan of huawei smartwatches but at the end of the day i will always review them with full honesty so people know exactly what they are buying i am quite impressed with the pro elite i'm actually also testing the standard gt3 active which is slightly smaller and thinner and that full review is coming soon and i will be sharing my experiences very soon thank you so much for watching and i'll see you all in the next one [Music] peace [Music] you paradise welcome to camera comparison to branching Walter sever pro galaxy s 10 plus and the Huawei P 30 right now it works recording on the front cameras of each phone so we think to the video quality as well as audio quality so starting off with rear camera video the oneplus is off to a flying start its high dynamic ranges so capable that it's the only phone where you can distinguish not just the dark water the green trees but also the blue in the sky also only the oneplus and the Samsung can record 4k video at 60 frames per second the four-way is limited to 34 this whole comparison I've set the hallway to its smooth color option but even then colors are coming out a little bit funky Samsung is the most natural in the situation stabilization at 4k resolution it looks like oneplus has knocked it out the park the oneplus 7 pro looks even more stable than the p30 pro which in itself is even more stable than the s10 plus when we turn the resolution down to 1080p all three phones have incredible stabilization the galaxy s 10 + moves into its super steady video mode and p30 pro uses its AI features as well to create a similar results safe to say the 7 pro is at least as good as the other 2 something you will notice on the oneplus though is that whilst the phone does come with an ultra light camera you can't use it for video at least not yet even when you can use it and we've all come to this when we talk about photos it's just not as wide as the other two phones it can do 117 degrees versus always 120 versus Samsung's 123 degrees you might also know that all three phones have a telephoto lens as well the wampler 7 pro at 3 x oom as 10 plus with two times and the Huawei with five bear in mind though that the oneplus footage looks pretty grainy it looks like instead of taking video using d telephoto camera it's actually just cropping in from what the main camera is capturing all three can record continuous 240 frame per second slow motion and I was really happy with how it looks on the S 10 + and the 1 + 7 Pro and in fact you can see that in terms of exposure of the background oneplus is even doing it better than Samsung the Galaxy S 10 though does go a step further it can record bursts of super slow motion and 960 frame per second video the wall we can - but it's using a bit of software trickery to achieve it and it's not true 960 fps okay as the light starts to dip this is where it gets really interesting so we're starting off with a middling lighting scenario it's not really dark yet but you can already see that Samsung's footage is already starting to Peter off it's lost a lot of sharpness compared to the other two if we try zooming in five times on each I would actually say oneplus looks better than Huawei this could be because it seems to use the main sensor as opposed to its telephoto for video and in this particular case that helps it you can also see the noise reduction algorithms as well as the high dynamic range algorithms on the oneplus really drawing out every bit of detail that the cameras capturing I was super impressed with this as we go even darker you can really tell the STM plus is falling behind whilst both the one plus seven pro and the p30 Pro are actually capturing the details inside this well-lit building the attempt loss is just making it a blown-out mess the seventh pro is at least keeping up with the p30 Pro that's kind of amazing and super surprising considering that this is one of the p30s main at selling points ok so just before I talk about nighttime photography let's take a quick look at the specs of each smartphones camera all three phones have a primary camera with the oneplus as being the highest resolution in terms of ultra light you've got the galaxy s 10 which has the widest ultra wide lens and then in terms of telephoto while we has the maximum zoom 5 times versus two times and three times also only on the huawei you've got a fourth time of flight camera for assisting with portrait mode as soon as we dive into nighttime photography the Huawei p30 Pro really starts to come into its own it creates generally speaking the most well rounded image the one with the deepest blacks but also the brightest whites it creates a super high dynamic range picture even when there's barely any dynamic range in the actual environment Huawei also adds a healthy dose of sharpness which is not always a good thing but it usually helps in these nighttime scenarios take a look at the brickwork on the floor in these images now to be clear all three are actually really decent night modes the oneplus 7 pro has been a massive improvement over the 60 the galaxy s 10 plus is the first time Samsung is actually introduced a dedicated night mode feature but in most scenarios Huawei is ahead and for starters is actually the only one of the three that can use its ultra wide lens while taking night mode for toes on doormat note is actually the only one that can use a zoom lens as well which as you can imagine with five times zoom capability makes a game-changing difference but there is one point worth addressing whilst the hallway is undoubtedly the more flexible camera a night when there is a decent amount of light in these nightmare shots it doesn't necessarily capture more detail in fact it's noise reduction algorithm is so powerful - often times it smooths out the edges even more so than the other two versions when it comes to flush one plus has the most powerful flash module although sometimes that can result in a bit of overexposure you'll see the STM plus has a slightly green tinge to it and the hallway it more on the warm side daytime photography is where hallway starts to fall behind and the samsung galaxy s TM plus i would say takes the lead the images between the 1 plus and the Samsung though are not too far apart the Samsung adds a really nice dose of saturation that brings a warmth to images in this image you can see that while we is struggling to balance both the dark water and the bright sky but the 1 plus on the Samsung have pretty comparable high dynamic range capabilities the differences are more just in how the image is presented and the color processing the p30 pros photos have a high contrast look to them the slightly grungy industrial aesthetic you might like it you might not you'll notice again the difference is in the field of view of the ultra wide lenses although it's not as stark as the difference is when taking video because of the way the sensor is used but it is still enough of a difference to mean that the Galaxy S 10 Plus can often fit a whole building in that the p30 pro struggles with and other one plus has no chance with oh yeah and take a look at the p30 pros image here even though I've purposefully set that phone to its natural smooth color option when you go to that ultra wide camera it just dials a contrast art alright let's talk about zoom so these three photos were taken with each phone's main camera and these three with each phone's telephoto you can see that one plus is 3 x oom gets you a fair bit closer to the subject than Samsung's 2 x with the p30 Pro and it's 5 times optical zoom way in front if you then push each phone if you force them to adopt 10 times magnification you kind of get the result you'd expect p30 pro in front then the 7 pro then the s10 plus if we try again with this image here you can see that one plus and samsung they have a good level of consistency between the colors of their main camera and their telephoto cameras but neither of them can come close to just the detailed of what way captures when zooming in in terms of macro that while we can get quite a lot closer to subjects and still retain focus on them compared to the s10 which in itself can do better than the womp plus portrait mode the one plus seven pro takes amazing portraits but it is a little bit annoying that it uses the telephoto lens so you have to take a couple of steps back every time you want to do one I think always high contrast look kind of works here although if you look at the buildings in the background it doesn't really create a smooth transition between them and the sky what about straight-up raw detail what about if you wanted to take a photo print it out and just blow it up as big as possible it's gonna be Samsung Samsung captures almost in every scenario slightly more texture than the other two Samsung also generally speaking takes better quality front-facing video it's 4k resolution completely smashes the other two phones ability to take 1080p only having said that if you want to take 4k video on that camera you're gonna miss out on stabilization the other two phones with their 1080p footage will be more steady also whoa is AI HDR kicks in here and you can see it's the only firm that can correctly exposed the blue sky in the background for taking selfies during the day there isn't a huge amount in it but generally speaking I would side with the s temp plus because it has a secondary depth sensor on the front the portrait mode especially looks as good as the portraits from some phones and rear cameras don't underestimate the oneplus though in some cases I would say it does outperform the other two and it's clearly a massive improvement over the oneplus 60 last year all three can capture a fair bit in one frame so they're gonna be OK for a group photo but not quite as good as their Google pixel three's front-facing ultra wide camera what surprised me is that as the light starts to fall the oneplus slowly emerges as the best selfie camera amongst our three whether you're taking standard selfies or portrait mode selfies it consistently beats out the s Templars and the p30 Pro and finally bit of a mouthful but if you're taking a front-facing video in low light then Samsung is slightly ahead of the oneplus which is a fair bit ahead of the p30 pro which is a complete mess at this point all right if you enjoyed this video I've got plenty more coming so it'll be massively appreciated if you could subscribe to the channel my name is Aaron this is mr. who's the boss I'll catch you in the next one [Music] you [Music] the huawei watch line has changed dramatically since it first debuted in 2015. the first one ran android wear and turned heads with its striking design and the second one focused on fitness tracking with a more rugged appearance and now we have the huawei watch 3 which seeks to bring the best of all those earlier wearables into a single product fantastic design solid health features and apparently multi-day battery life as well thanks to the new harmony os software so is it any good well first take a sec to subscribe to android central right here on youtube and we'll jump in and find out [Music] the huawei watch 3 unit i've been using for the past week or so is the 46 millimeter model in stainless steel with a brown leather strap it's also available in a 42 millimeter configuration with a rubber strap and like most modern smartwatches not made by apple the watch 3 uses a standard strap so customizing the look further should not be a problem the centerpiece of the watch of course is the circular oled display with 326 pixels per inch it's highly detailed and also boasts up to a thousand nits of brightness its edges are slightly domed like last year's watch gt2 making the various swipes required to get around the harmony os software feel natural and pleasant even using it out and about in bright sunlight the display was always bright enough for easy visibility the biggest hardware addition this time around is the digital crown located around the 2 o'clock position looks very similar to the apple watches crown save of course for the huawei watch branding engraved on its outer face and it's the best implementation of a digital crown that i've seen outside of the apple watch that's largely down to the solid haptic feedback you get when you're rotating it a very subtle tap as you scroll through notifications menu options and lists pressing on the crown functions is a combined wake back and home button if you're in an app you'll go back to the watch face or from the watch face press it again to view the app launcher this is pretty much a carbon copy of the apple watch's grid layout though it's possible to change this to a list view if you prefer and if you're really into multitasking on a wearable a double press of the crown will fire up the circular recent apps menu the ui in general will feel very familiar if you've used a huawei or wear os watch in the past though it is a whole lot smoother and more performant than any of those devices from the watch face a swipe down shows you quick settings swipe up for notifications write for fitness tiles or left to view the weather tile and that tile actually houses a shortcut to huawei celia ui voice assistant along with any media controls that you might be using and celia can also be loaded at any time by long pressing the programmable secondary key along the five o'clock position celia is reasonably capable when it comes to understanding basic on-device actions like starting a workout but i'm sure this won't be a huge surprise to anyone it's nowhere near the level of a google assistant for general voice queries despite its dressy exterior fitness tracking is a major focus of the huawei watch 3 and the watch boasts 5 atmospheres of water resistance for activities around or even in water by default the programmable secondary button is set to start a workout and there are countless pre-configured options covering everything from a light walk to a triathlon goals can be set by time distance or calories burned all of which is synced back to the huawei health app on your phone which in turn can sync with google fit the watch 3 also includes a standard loadout of sensors on its rear including heart rate and blood oxygenation as well as the new continuous skin temperature monitoring as with any smartwatch it's difficult to know exactly how accurate most of this stuff is but i regularly recorded spl2 levels around 99 which is probably good considering anything below 95 is cause for concern i've been using the lte equipped while i watch three but without a sim configured so i haven't experienced any of its standalone cellular capabilities but if that's your thing the internal e sim can be enabled as part of the normal setup so while i wasn't able to take advantage of the device's standalone mobile features i did find the calling capabilities worked well with ample volume and clarity from that internal speaker i've also been pretty impressed with huawei watch 3's battery life compared to rival wearables with my usage i was getting just under 5 days on a single charge with the always on display disabled and around an hour or so of workout detection on most days that comes with a caveat that i haven't really been using the device's cellular functionality at all so expect some additional battery drain if you're out and about taking calls when it comes time to charge you'll use the boxed hockey puck charger which snaps onto the back of the watch and refills it over the chi wireless standard and of course the use of qi means you can use other wireless charging pads to top up the huawei watch 3. but there are some trade-offs involved in using the first harmony os wearable in fact most of my gripes with the huawei watch 3 are software related while harmony os generally works pretty well on a watch this initial release of the software isn't without a fair few bugs as well as other pain points that get in the way of everyday use firstly the initial setup is more confusing than it needs to be because the huawei health app needed to set up the watch is only available as a standalone download not on google play and the qr code provided on the watch to get it doesn't actually work though that could possibly be to do with this just being a pre-release device i also experienced several frustrating permission prompts the first time i used certain apps the way harmony os handles prompts like this is very smart phony and just kind of clumsy and confusing when you see it on a wearable the smartwatch app library in harmony os is fairly limited at present too that's not a huge deal for me personally i don't use a ton of apps on my smart watches but if you're expecting an ecosystem to rival google's wear os then you'll definitely be disappointed on that front and while the huawei watch 3's notification support is better than the watch gt and older models you're still limited in the way you can interact with most android notifications unlike wear os there's no way to reply in line and notifications stick around on your watch even after you've dismissed them on your phone often leading to a backlog of old notifications at the end of the day finally rounding off my list of complaints is the relatively scant loadout of watch faces preloaded on the watch 3. there are a few really good looking minimalist options but most of the huawei designed faces are over designed or just plain ugly there are many more third-party watch faces available to buy via huawei storefront but of course that involves spending yet more money so the huawei watch 3 is easily the company's best wearable to date combining a solid loadout of health and exercise tracking features with a really slick and performant ui and unlike some of huawei's old wearables it actually looks good too the watch 3 transfers most wear os watches when it comes to battery life and has the best implementation of a digital crown on anything that's not an apple watch the design is attractive yet neutral enough to work with just about any third-party strap that fits your style and that focus on style doesn't come at the expense of durability health features or conveniences like wireless charging the only thing to bear in mind is that it's still early days for harmony os so some bugs are to be expected and by the same token you're not gonna have a huge selection of apps to choose from on day one nevertheless the huawei watch 3 is definitely worth considering if you want a good looking alternative to some of the more traditional smart watches from samsung fossil and others that's it for now be sure to subscribe to android central right here so you don't miss future reviews coming soon thanks for watching and i'll see you next time you hey guys it's Eric here and this is my unboxing and review of the Huawei y9s this is not to be confused with the y9 2019 or y9 prime 2019 which I reviewed on my channel when we open the box we greeted with a smartphone let's go ahead and peel out the sticker on the back and on the front this is the breathing crystal color it also comes in midnight black now the screen protector already applied let's power it on while you see what else is in the box we have an envelope that houses the sim ejector tool the user guide a clad CPU case with all the necessary cutouts on the bottom compartment we get a standard 10 watt charger a USB type-c cable and a pair of earphones on the front we have a 6.5 9 inch full HD plus IPS LCD display with 19 point 5 by 9 aspect ratio on top of that display you have a 16 megapixel pop-up camera and an earpiece on the back you have a triple camera set off a 48 megapixel main shooter an 8 megapixel ultra wide-angle lens and 2 megapixel camera for depth sensing with flash you also get some wallet branding on the left you have nothing on the right you have your volume rocker and a power button that doubles up as your finger print sensor on the top of the device you have a microphone and a hybrid hissing trade at houses to 4G LTE nano Sims for one same and one SD card on the bottom you have your speaker grill a USB type-c port a second microphone and a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack the aluminum frame and glass back of the y9 s is as premium as it gets it has a very small camera bump and honestly not a lot of mid-range phones I've seen look or feel this good the breathing crystal gradient color is a fingerprint repellent which is something you don't see very often on a mid-range phone we saw it first on the P 30 series the y9 s is a phablet sized phone and a lot of what you see up front is the display no.not or punch hole similar to the y9 prime 2019 and it's all thanks to the motorized pop-up camera the Full HD Plus display is pretty bright outdoors great for consuming media and you can watch your YouTube videos in 1080p it is not the most color accurate display out there but it is customizable to suit your tastes this comes in six gigs of RAM and 128 gigs of storage it ships with Android 9 pi and emui 9.1 slapped on top of it this has full Google service support and will be getting regular updates in the settings you get all the sig nifty features you saw on the y9 prime 2019 I was kind of hoping for the dark mode or second space but I guess those features are reserved for flagships about performance this uses wow is high silicon Kirin 7/10 F CPU clocked at 2.2 gigahertz this isn't the latest mid-range ship by Huawei but it is tested and trusted it still bridges through most tasks without lagging or heating up and I haven't gotten complaints about any of the other phones running on this chip the fingerprint sensor is super fast and you don't even have to press the power button this is the first side mounted fingerprint sensor from Huawei that I'm reviewing and I'm quite impressed I wasn't even a fan of side mounted fingerprint sensors before now when it comes to gaming as usual I play pop to your default settings which is balanced graphics and medium frame rates he had those games just like the waianae 2019 and I did a separate gaming review for it with games like past 2019 and house 49 I'll be living a link to it up above and in the description box do let me know if there are any more games you like me to test on this guy about battery life the four thousand milliamp hour battery got me through a foodie of using mostly social media apps and three plus hours of pop G all on Wi-Fi this gave me 11 hours of screen on time with 17% level to spare quite impressive for a display this big the battery temperature running cool on medium to heavy usage is probably what keeps it at its optimal performance it took me 1 hour and 59 minutes to charge from 0 to 100% it does not support fast charging the Triple A eye camera of the y9s has seen some major upgrades of the y9 prime 2019 now you have a 48 megapixel in shooter which actually isn't set by default rather you have it set at 12 megapixel as recommended now looking at these two side-by-side you can barely tell the difference but when you crop the image you see way more details on the 48 megapixels shot it does take a second or two to capture and process the image but depending on the purpose of the photos you capture you may be wanting to leave it on this setting taking close-up shots like these don't require you to switch to 48 megapixel cause as you can see it is quite detailed just as is especially if you plan to post on social media the portrait mode does identify a blow out of the background but also isn't quite as sharp as the primary shot the selfie portrait mode is not as accurate when it comes to map in your face what I like is the night mode and how it makes all the difference when it comes to capturing details indoors the mid-range ness of the camera shows quite a lot which isn't a bad thing if you're not expecting anything like a PDE like new edition quality you get screen flash for your late-night selfies which I'm still not sure anybody does it shoots videos in 1080p so I'm currently recording the front-facing camera of the Huawei y9s and I can see a bit of overexposure around the side unless you tap on it and then you see that the gate is actually green but here's what the audio sounds like the one we whine is maybe an incremental upgrade over the y9 prime 2019 but in this largely overlooked phablet category the premium build and camera upgrades are definitely worth the price difference now they are quite a number of compact to average-sized mid-range smartphones out now better specs but the y9s isn't claiming that need the fact that you would even consider it means that you either have big hands or you consume a lot of media on the go for some reason you love that middle of the road between a tablet and the phone most phones that remotely look like the y9s are either too expensive or made from plastic the Wobby y9s is priced at ninety eight thousand nine hundred Mara which converts to 275 US dollars and you can pre-order it on junior start announced in the 15th of December to get the wobbly band for a

I'm up to do subscribe for more videos like this as it will mean a lot to me and I'll see you in the next one peace you this video was sponsored by backplace stick around to the end of the video where i'll have a link for you to try out their unlimited computer backups for free the huawei ban was originally announced in may of 2019 and i made a full video explaining it back then but over a year has passed since and i wanted to take a closer look at what happened since how was the ban actually implemented and how did it impact huawei its competitors its suppliers the industry as a whole so in the 68th episode of the story behind series let's take a second look at the huawei ban [Music] the thing we usually refer to as the huawei ban isn't actually a single band but rather a collection of many smaller bands that sort of fall into two main groups first is a band that stops u.s network operators like verizon and a tnt from buying huawei networking equipment to build their networks and this specific part of the ban has been rather clear-cut as not only has huawei been removed from all new purchases but network operators have also been ordered to rip existing huawei solutions out of their networks too removing existing equipment is a long and complicated process that will take years but the ban is in full force and parallel to that the us has also tried to convince or rather pressure other countries to do the same with varying amounts of success of the us's closest allies all four have either completely or partially announced that they would avoid huawei equipment while lots of other traditional us allies including germany and the philippines have resisted the pressure each allowing their operators to buy at least some huawei equipment the second big group of bands is connected to the u.s putting huawei on its entity list we originally thought this would mean u.s companies in general would be bought from supplying huawei with any goods or services but that did not end up being the case at all and after many months of flip-flopping around and extensions and delays the us government actually ended up implementing these entity list bans rather arbitrarily to explain what i mean let's actually take a look at the seven key suppliers of huawei that i think you as tech enthusiasts will know about google obviously arm and tsmc which huawei needs for making processors and finally microsoft intel amd and nvidia which make the operating systems and various components that power huawei's laptops amongst other things of those seven five are u.s companies and weirdly enough four of the five seem to have gotten licenses to keep selling to huawei the company has released multiple new laptops since the ban all running microsoft's windows and using chips from intel amd and nvidia it's hard to say why exactly those were approved but my guess would be that the us government just didn't consider huawei's laptop business to be big enough to be relevant instead the us seems to have focused on bands that would specifically hurt huawei's two biggest businesses by far which of course are phones and networking on phones google had to completely drop support for new huawei models that came out after the ban meaning that besides losing access to google apps like maps gmail or the play store itself they would also lose access to gms or google mobile services gms are a set of background services that are pre-installed on most regular phones that a ton of third-party apps rely on too like google location services that apps like uber use to find you on a map safetynet which many banking apps use to ensure your phone hasn't been tampered with and firebase which many apps including my very own crowd use for sending notifications with gms gone from huawei phones hundreds of thousands of android apps either don't work on them at all or they do so badly unless of course they are rewritten for huawei phones specifically now other than google the u.s has also started exerting pressure on huawei's high silicon business unit which makes chips that power not only the majority of huawei phones and wearables but also its server and networking products the way this chip business typically works is that high silicon basically takes a bunch of designs from external companies like arm for their cpus and gpus for example they add their own customizations and components on top they combine all of that into a so-called soc or system on a chip and then they have an external company usually tsmc actually manufacture them in huge quantities in other words high silicon and by extension all of huawei's core hardware products rely heavily on arm and tsmc neither of which are u.s companies but both of which have received a ton of pressure from the us to drop support the us has had luck pressuring tsmc who has announced a few weeks ago that they would stop manufacturing huawei chips altogether which is a huge blow to huawei as tsmc is much better than anyone else at making chips while arm currently still licenses their designs to huawei but is doing so on really shaky grounds arm licenses inside china are actually handled by a chinese subsidiary which is majority owned by chinese investors so that is probably what has shielded them from u.s pressure so far but arm is actually going through quite a lot of turmoil right now and that might leave them exposed eventually anyway farm china is in a legal battle with its own parent arm holdings and arm holdings itself is currently being auctioned off by its parent and depending on who ends up buying it arm might or might not have to cut ties with huawei in the end i've talked about all the chip troubles of huawei and arm in detail on my second channel the friday checkout i've linked to that somewhere here but either way one thing is clear huawei's chip business is under enormous pressure so looking at these seven suppliers then we can see pretty clearly that the entity list ban is in practice not at all what the us government announced at first it is not a ban on u.s companies in general supplying huawei but rather the us picking out a few key suppliers from basically anywhere in the world especially the ones it thinks our court to huawei's business and pressuring those to cut their ties with huawei okay now that we are up to speed with what has actually been banned let's take a look at how these bans have impacted huawei and the industry in general in terms of being banned from various 5g networks around the world the story is rather simple huawei has simply lost a ton of international contracts and it seems to be squeezed out of some key countries for the foreseeable future meaning that its competitors like nokia ericsson and samsung can be happy that said huawei still reigns supreme at home which is a gigantic market it is likely to remain dominant in a few international markets as well and it's actually receiving royalties for its 5g patents that are used even by network operators who don't choose to buy their equipment so while this is a major blow to them i don't think it's fatal at all the real threat in my opinion is actually the loss of key suppliers like google and tsmc because these losses mean that huawei now has to basically completely restructure its business and re-engineer its products on short notice the loss of google services suddenly made huawei phones much less attractive to many consumers outside of china which forced them to regroup and focus their efforts on the markets that work they de-emphasized markets like india where they never managed to become dominant anyway and they stopped their expansion to new markets like the united states for example instead huawei doubled down on its domestic market of china where the google ban simply didn't affect them as well as on its strongest international markets like europe and especially russia where the reliance on google is much smaller and the chinese refocusing has worked admirably well leading to huawei reaching a super impressive 46 market share and managing to increase their domestic sales so much that it actually offset most of their international losses the company now sells over 70 of its phones in china up from around 50 when the ban was implemented and with a bit of luck from corona disproportionately hurting samsung's core markets of the us brazil and india the most huawei even briefly managed to overtake samsung to become the largest filmmaker in the world huawei's success at home came almost entirely at the expense of other chinese competitors who i am sure were not too happy about it but it is impressive performance from huawei nonetheless outside of china though huawei is having a much tougher time the company has been in a desperate race to create a parallel software universe to google's with its own app store and hms or huawei mobile services that replace google's play store and gms and it has tried to onboard as many international developers as possible while they still have a critically large user base with each month since the band though their sales have been falling which means that attracting developers becomes harder and harder meaning that huawei is in a frantic race against the clock to reach critical mass with its app platforms before it's too late and huawei certainly has impressive numbers to show with 81 000 apps now having hms built in and 700 million active users sadly the majority of those are probably inside china while abroad huawei is still definitely missing a lot a recent article from pocketland for example said that only six of the 32 most popular non-google apps from the uk play store are in huawei's app gallery so far and while many of them can be installed with less direct methods this kind of highlights the scale of the problem add to that that google apps like gmail maps and youtube are apparently never going to come to huawei phones officially again and these shortcomings might just be a big enough inconvenience for the majority of non-tacky users to just skip huawei phones altogether now much like with apps starting last month huawei is now also in a race against the clock with its chip business as it recently lost access to its key manufacturing partner tsmc as i explained in a previous video of mine on my second channel tsmc is simply so much better at actually manufacturing chips than any current chinese chip foundry like smic that huawei having to switch to those might actually make huawei's chips so much less competitive that most of huawei's devices including phones wearables and even networking products might just start losing out to their competitors anyway even if they managed to sort out their software situation and that i think is where really scary things start happening because now with the ban on tsnc huawei essentially has to find three distinct almost impossibly difficult battles all at once first it has to establish a mobile ecosystem that can beat or at least approach regular android and ios which every company including microsoft has failed at so far second it has to figure out how to manufacture mobile chips on the level of quality that can match tsmc which nobody including intel samsung or smic have managed to do lately and while they're busy with that they also have to make products that are so much better than the competition that people will buy them despite having sub-par software support and potentially sub-par processors and that just seems impossibly hard to me especially given that there's no guarantee that things won't actually get even worse for them in the future the us government could manage to get armed to drop huawei as a client which would force them to also redesign their entire chip business while they're at it you could try to force other suppliers like sony or samsung to stop supplying them with components like camera sensors for example and who knows what else there are just so many huge fires for huawei to fight all at once that even a company as rich in technical resources and with as much support from its own country as huawei won't be able to innovate their way out of all of them on the long run so unless there's a political resolution to the problem like maybe the u.s actually walking back on some of its bans or at least being so slow to implement them that huawei would get some time to catch up with things i would actually expect things to start breaking at huawei sooner rather than later okay on to lighter topics at the beginning of this video i promised to show you how you can get free access to backblaze which is the service i used to backup my computers including my many terabytes of video files backblaze is a piece of software you install on your pc or mac that can then backup basically all of your files to their cloud you get unlimited computer backups backplace keeps multiple versions of your files for 30 days for restoring and everything is encrypted on your device before it's uploaded so backblaze or hackers can't actually access your files and the coolest thing is that you can not only view your files from a mobile app and restore them by downloading them but you can actually have backplates ship you a physical hard drive overnight if your data is lost which you can then copy your data from and return to get a refund that is ridiculously useful if you have a lot of data and if you aren't backing your stuff up somewhere offsite already then now is the time to start my viewers using the link in the description will get a 15 day free trial without even having to give a credit card or anything and if you still like it after that and decide to stay it's just six dollars a month no hidden fees no add-ons nothing so back your stuff up use the link in the description and i'll see you next week [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] everyone huawei announced their new operating system harmony os 2.0 along with their new huawei watch 3 and the mate pad 2 pro harmony os is huawei's answer to android and the company will be updating more than 100 devices to the new os over the next year but what exactly does this mean for users i'm angie for gs marina and this is what's new with harmony os 2.0 and huawei's latest devices [Music] interestingly harmony os seems to refer to the new device ecosystem the actual new operating system on their phones and the software that all huawei devices will be running even if these three things are very different i'm going to focus on the tablet version of harmony os because the phone version is only available in china at the moment and the two should be pretty similar the os is heavily based on android both as codebase and as ux but it allows the company to break free of the us limitations android os is an open source system even though it's created and maintained by google and everyone is free to develop their own versions of it as long as they don't insist on integrating google services which huawei clearly isn't huawei has used this as an opportunity to create a more seamless interconnection between their devices phones smart tvs watches and even laptops will all work together smoothly this may sound similar to apple's homekit and samsung smartthings but huawei wants to make this interconnection even easier and on a broader scale if you open up harmony os 2.0 on a phone or a tablet like the new matepad2 pro you will see it looks a lot like emui 11. you have your apps at the bottom and you can make two types of folders depending on what you need there are regular folders and then smart folders which are larger and show the icons of the apps inside swipe down on the top left of your device and you'll see a standard looking notification panel however if you swipe down from the top right you'll see the harmony os control panel that has clearly taken some inspiration from ios there are toggles for things like the flashlight and auto rotation according to huawei here you can create super devices these are interconnected pieces of hardware that work together on the harmonyos network through your phone let's say that your phone and your tablet are linked from then on huawei will consider this to be one super device and from then on in the task center you'll see tasks from both devices you can then move a task from your phone to your tablet and vice versa and control what application you want to run where since huawei is launching the new mate pad 2 and mate pad 2 pro that support their second generation and pencil you might use the pencil to draw directly on one of the tablets and then switch over the art to your phone and upload it to social media from there the control panel serves as a unified portal for users to check devices and control them from a distance without having to rummage around in settings for example you can tap on the music widget to play a song and choose which streaming app you want to play your music but without actually opening it up then you can use the same widget to select which headphone or speaker should play the song or you can use one of their watches like the huawei watch 3 to take a picture from your phone through your watch without actually having to go into your phone the watch also features travel apps that can hold your boarding pass information sports apps so you can check in on your favorite teams and smart remote control for things like your lights at home so there will likely be some level of control panel implementation in the watch too huawei hopes to make it easier for developers to deploy the same code on different hardware by using the distributed application network provided by the new os behind the scenes huawei has also optimized their software so that even if the rom is almost full there won't be the slowdown that we're used to seeing on other phones that should mean that most apps and functions launch faster and continue to launch faster through the lifespan of the device in short it's very promising to see all this interconnectivity on a platform that isn't samsung's or apples it'll be unlikely for it to completely take off in the west considering how much we've come to rely on google's applications for all sorts of everyday tasks but even if you don't get a phone with it it's likely that western consumers like you and me will use some of their other new devices and run into the new os like their smart watches or tablets it's clear that huawei has invested a lot of effort into not just creating a new os but an entire functional ecosystem that stands as an alternative to samsung's and apples there's a lot to explore here and it'll be interesting to see just how much huawei ends up developing it for now we'll probably get a taste with their new huawei watch 3 and their new tablets most importantly it's great to see all this competition because when big companies compete it's us the users that end up winning in the end thank you for watching everyone stay safe and i'll see you guys next time you huawei new generation smart data center solution is coming this is fusion module 2000 single row [Music] this is fusion module 800 this is fusion module 500 one cabinet 1dc huawei fusion module series is designed for diverse industries make any room a data center [Music] hey what's up mkbhd here and i was right i was right i told you i look i didn't want to say i told you so but i did didn't i so i just recently made a video showing you guys the huawei mate xs one of the sexiest folding phones out maybe the sexiest but my conclusion was okay it's hot i like this a lot but it's not practical and so maybe we should stop the whole folding over the outside thing until the tech gets a little bit better then we'll come back to it so now here we have the huawei mate x2 brand new just got announced and i've got my hands on it and as you can see they've done the thing they've gone from an outside fold to an inside folding display so now it's doing a lot of things really similarly to samsung's z-fold 2 which i reviewed and really liked but there's actually a couple things here that are different that make this the best folding phone hardware out right now so first of all this outside screen it's even bigger and higher quality than samsung's to the point where it actually feels like a full-fledged smartphone and i know we were just saying that about the z-fold 2 because it was so much better than the first fold and that's poor excuse for a front screen but the mate x2 clearly beats out the fold too and it's no contest it's a full 6.45 inch diagonal so it's actually pretty huge and it's wider so it's much closer to a normal aspect ratio it's 2700 by 1600 oled with thin bezels and a 90 hertz refresh rate plus they've given it a 240hz touch sample rate this looks like a normal smartphone when i'm holding it it doesn't quite feel like one still because of course it's still twice as thick and the fingerprint reader is on the bottom half as the power button and obviously it's not quite just like a normal phone but the goal is to remove as many trade-offs as possible and that's what they're all trying to do here but yeah look at that just looks just like a normal smartphone especially with that aspect ratio close to it anyway a quick word on that selfie camera though so you can see it's a double wide pill shaped cut out there so you have the selfie camera itself and then i believe a time of flight sensor next to it which i bet they thought a lot about on a phone like this because that time of flight sensor is good for giving you a little bit of better depth information and potentially better focus now if i just want to hop on a random video call or just take a quick selfie i just use the regular camera i don't need that it is cool to have auto focus in a selfie camera don't get me wrong the time of flight sensor helps with that but i feel like if i actually care about an accurate portrait mode and the depth information i'm doing more than just a regular selfie well then on a phone like this i can open up the phone and use the incredible high quality cameras on the back and take a way better selfie photo portrait mode videos all that stuff will be great so i was just thinking when i saw this they probably could have left it out and just done a regular small cut out for the selfie camera but obviously having faster autofocus for a camera like this like they did in the p40 pro plus is a nice bonus so not a huge deal cool to have the point is this outside screen being a way closer to traditional 15 by 9 aspect ratio makes it way more usable than any other outside screen on a foldable phone it's the major strength of this mate x2 now when you go on the inside that's where you get your uninterrupted 8-inch display uninterrupted because there's no selfie camera cut out at all and it's really nice it's also 90 hertz which is pretty good it's an 8 to 7.1 aspect ratio so nearly square and there's hardly any crease at all i am very very impressed by how well this display and hinge combine to minimize the look and feel of any crease down the middle now it's definitely still there it's not totally gone and you can see it at the most extreme viewing angles but it's actually much better than samsung's fold and this hinge like really nicely firmly pops the phone open to flat this is a good one that is a good hinge right there it's a good hinge shout out to the hinge engineers the engineers of course also when it's closed it actually uh it's closer to flat and and flush with the back of the phone so it doesn't really protrude as much if you note in the z fold two it kind of protrudes out the side a little bit and when you're holding it you feel like you're holding more of that hinge so it is impressive that they also managed to squeeze it further into the phone body itself feels less obtrusive that way but then there is one especially wild thing about this phone and you might have noticed it by now in the footage but it's it's a wedge shape look at this it's a wedge going from the thinnest all the way on the left 4.4 millimeters all the way to the thickest heaviest part on the right hand side and that is of course intentional huawei's got their reasoning for it which is it feels better in the hand so hear me out or hear them out they argue that with phones like the z-fold because the center of gravity is further from your hand when you hold it that little bit of wobble feels extra heavy like there's a lot of weight really far from your hand and that's what makes the phone feel heavy so by putting more of the weight closer to your hand the center of gravity is now closer to where it would be in a normal phone and the thinner lighter bit that's outside feels lighter and i buy that i really do i feel like this phone feels less heavy it is still overall a pretty heavy phone but you can tell it feels different in the hand when it's open and i think that feels better than the z-fold too it's nice now when it is closed it's got this slanted mid line that's kind of funny but that's totally fine it still goes pretty much flush protects the inside screen and really the only possible downsides of this particular shape is it rocks a lot on a table thanks to the big camera bump but you know it's just annoying it's not a deal breaker a lot of phones rock but also the total combined battery size is 4 500 milliamp hours which is a little bit small for something with this much screen it is funny though it is it's very tempting to just give this phone the foldable phone hardware crown like straight away just because even more so than samsung they are using very close to their flagship bits and specs inside this phone it's already the 90 hertz much bigger better display on the outside it's already a better like hinge design but also this mate x2 actually has just about the same camera system as their top end p40 pro plus or mate 40 pro plus which are really good cameras that's a 50 megapixel gigantic one over 1.28 inch primary camera you've got a 3x telephoto and a 10x periscope zoom lens and a slightly downgraded ultrawide but then it's still got a fairly advanced speaker system that pairs a driver at the top with one at the bottom for a pretty wide stereo sound as a bonus and yes they've put some pretty beefy specs inside too so kieran 9000 chip eight gigs of ram 256 gigs of storage it's 5g capable it's got wi-fi six it's just overall a very high-end piece of hardware in a lot of ways it does 55-watt fast charging with the charger that comes in the box which is pretty nice it could potentially i mean i haven't used this phone long enough to review battery life but it could potentially offset the concerningly small 4 500 milliamp hour battery because it's a 8 inch 90 hertz display and a high-end chip no wireless charging though that is a bummer but overall i am very impressed with this phone as a piece of hardware i gotta say now the software situation is the same as the first mate x which means no google app support and this one it's not coming to the us or anything i just wanted to get my hands on it to test it but i just i appreciate it for how impressive and cutting edge this piece of hardware is to me though i'm keeping this in the back of my head every time i see and get to test a new folding phone which is the end game for folding phones is you want to get it as close to just another feature as possible they want to remove as many caveats of having a folding phone as they possibly can a lot of the first gen ones it was really cool that they folded in half but they weren't really a great idea in a lot of other ways but eventually if they can get it to be just as usable without folding and just as good of a battery life and just as good specs and cameras and all that stuff and the folding and half part is just another feature and the price is pretty close to the same as regular phone that's when people will start to want them so yeah this phone to me it's a step towards that it's got a great outside screen obviously it's a little bit short on battery but a lot of the high-end specs really great cameras and just a really refined maybe that's the word a refined experience really nice hinge so i like it a lot it's on its way we'll get back to the outside fold stuff later either way that's been it thanks for watching i'll catch you guys the next one peace [Applause] [Music] last october huawei announced his 2020 flagship smartphones the mate 40 series ladies and gentlemen this is the huawei mate 4 mid-14 with the 40 pro it came only a month after the latest around of u.s sanctions took effect over the course of three years washington rode out multiple rounds of attacks against the chinese tactics a company we may not do business with at all first huawei phones were removed from u.s retailer shelves google looking to hang up on dennis cut huawei off from google's android and the latest it severed huawei's global supply chain of microchips so what has been a real damage to huawei well today we're here to find out though huawei has been cut off from android since may 2019 to this day most if not all the huawei phones are still running android i know you're wondering how is that possible to answer this question we need to first acknowledge that android wasn't created by google in the first place and since google acquired android in 2005 there have always been two variants of android the google version and the free open source version the google version has been locking android into google services ever since google services on just google apps but entire infrastructure within the system without it you would not be able to run a lot of everyday essential apps properly this is known as google mobile services or gms the heart of google's android for users around the world but you say chinese mainland users haven't had access to any google products for years well this only means that all android phones sold on the chinese market from xiaomi and huawei to oneplus and even samsung either have gms disabled by default or don't have it at all and even though google's android dominates the market the open source and google free version of android has always been available for developers manufacturers can take that android version and add their own touches that's how we have xiaomi's miui oneplus oxygen os and huawei's emui google barring the company from fast forward to may 2019 google was forced to cut huawei off from his future android updates here we're once again talking about the gms version no problem at all for chinese mainland users but let's not forget huawei also has an enormous market outside of the chinese mainland and for those users and potential buyers it could become a deal breaker but huawei is this gigantic tech company it won't just take that hit lying down so what did huawei do it brought out hms or huawei mobile services hms is not new it has been the core of emui for years but the u.s sanctions have given it a kind of rebirth hms aims to provide mobile apps with an infrastructure similar to gms as well as to enable third-party developers to create their own apps hms is like huawei's parallel universe of the mainstream android ecosystem wait a second but what about harmony os you know the operating system that huawei dedicated an entire event to back in september wasn't that like huawei's response to google's android ban well not exactly huawei's harmony os is the whole different type of operating system that the company built from scratch on one hand you have android a monolithic system developed from linux and on the other you have harmony os a microkernel distributed system meaning it would not require his hosting hardware to be as powerful as the smartphone harmony is designed to run on virtually any electronic device from dishwashers to vancouver cleaners now that the data has been set for the debut of the harmony os 2.0 there's a lot to expect on june 2nd but if you're hoping for a drastic shift from the android user experience you're out of luck people have tested the osa well it almost fully supports android's apps the user interface is very much like that of android only faster and less energy consuming and that's exactly what huawei's been trying to achieve through harmony a seamless transition from what his competitor offers so that's may gradually chip away android's market share now huawei has set an ambitious go 300 million devices running harmony by the end of this year including 100 million non-huawei devices in order for an operating system to thrive performance is often not a priority for the entire ecosystem behind it many brands including blackberry microsoft and samsung have failed miserably and for huawei it could prove to be a bumpy right hey guys it's yourita girl mary and welcome back to my channel for today's video guys along with a man excited but this time it's another novel offering from huawei polyum big brother in huawei

Hwang jung-min president of global partnerships and eco Development to lead us on this journey [Music] thank you now we just enjoy a very exciting launch event by Richard Yee Wow we've launched the new exciting product the made book the new affordable smartphone and a lot but today you know the most important product launched by Richard II it's a ab gallery now I want to introduce the app Gary and the new play of our app Gary in 2020 so before we start let's take a look a very interesting short video sometimes I get the benefits of the app you wanna download it and I don't see innovation and excitement inside what I don't like about my current app store is that there are quite a few apps with recommendations and that makes it really hard to choose the right one there's just a lot of apps with bad quality that just won't work and I feel like maybe they need to step up their game with quality of vetting before they let them into the App Store I don't know where my data is being stored so it just doesn't feel very secure at all so from this street interview what is the number one complaint about the App Store data privacy so we all care about our personal debt for example your password your bank information and your fingerprint information so all these personal debt it's very risk currently in the mobile ecosystem number two concern you know currently in current mobile app stores there are millions of apps you need to choose very difficult to find what you want number three concern is the low quality there are a lot of low quality apps and a content in the Carnap store so those customer complaints it's our opportunity that is a wildly important reason to let us to bring a totally new mobile ecosystem so customer want reliable a more secure mobile ecosystem how can we do it firstly you know we just launched our new yearly a new report last year in the year of 2019 while we shipped more than 240 milling smarphone in the world that is not enough there are more than 600 millings of the monster active users in the world those big chasm pays way enable us to develop a new mobile system this is a latest brand survey tip more than approximately 60% of the people they consider to buy a new power smart devices so wowie is a brand choice of the customers but that is not enough so we have the chasm base we have very big numbers as a base why is not enough because to create a new mobile system we must have the new technology new approach we know in a past 10 years they are not of this effort it's dead so we must to build the Koch abilities a totally new platform to support us to create a new mobile ecosystem innovation it's our DNA in the past 30 years while we spend more than 10 percent of our revenue for the I&D each year give you the example we have the best Falchi for boss waffle just released by rich energy this four pole smurfo is a perfect example of innovation in terms of design and in terms of Technology another good example is how we maintain the meta is launched in the year of 2017 but which is the first smartphone in the world with embedded MPU chipset what is the meaning of MPU chipset MP you could give the smartphone our device artificial intelligence capabilities so like apps like the WPS like a storage sign can benefit from our new innovation all those capabilities we introduced to you in the future not only just use for wowie smartphone we also were open to all the global developers now there are more than 1.3 million of developers onboard they are working with us every day and the number is also growing every day to support them while we build a very strong platform this platform including HMS call for the fundamental service but the more important is our unique capabilities own device capabilities is we call the power HMS capabilities it will connect all kinds of the development tools and the efficiency integration and development with the support of the platform we will empower all the developers and publishers for their future innovation how we also build a centralized platform but with localization support we were leveraged our global service and a supporting platform we were provided a customized dedicated technical support to those developers who want us provide one-stop support that is very unique we know currently those mobile ecosystem they only provide the online support the forum support but we are different there are quite many apps right now I'm bored already also very successfully performed our AB carry we sincerely welcome more developers and publishers can work with bowwe we were provided our best total door service to you and hopefully next time your icon will be on the board if you have any of the questions if you need some support please contact us and the more and more tapas on board or AB carry everyday this is a perfect example it's my pleasure to introduce to you the news UK this partnership were took the full advantages of far we met access this fordable smartphone screen less listen to mrs. Scott the CTO of news UK a new UK we have some of the most historic media brands in the world The Times was founded in 1785 the Sun is Britain's biggest news website and more recently we're cried talkSPORT the largest sports radio station in the world I think there's a really good long-term partnership with can have with Huawei I feel there's a lot more innovation we can do and really drive forward amazing customer experiences on their devices our engineers have been working with Huawei engineers over the past month and we're so impressed with how easily we've been able to integrate with the Huawei ability gallery which seamlessly connects our services to the users it's been all hands on deck but we got there incredibly in the next month our customers can join The Times and Sunday Times the Sun and listen to Premier League football on the new mate excess handset I'm particularly excited about being able to flip open the phone and see our apps on full screen it looks really incredible and creates a reading experience like you've never seen on smartphones before so that is a perfect example how these third-party apps can benefit from our innovative devices like the med book access right now in the publish especially for the online publish they are all facing a big challenge the most of the news and the contents are invisible so this partnership were enable those news is information use content providers can directly reach their target audience so looking forward or a strange and the playing of 20/20 firstly where your folks are privacy just I mentioned before data protection personal data protection that is the most important features of our our our gallery and the second is quality we must care about the quality it means the quality of the older APIs and content in our gap up Gary it's very important number three should be the user appearance we need to buuuut higher level best-in-class of european for the privacy we know how we isolated all those mostly sensitive personal data like as a facial recognition data like a fingerprint to a very different environment we call these trusted execution environment to offer a best the security on the phone only on the phone we are the only smartphone company who's to get the approval of the most highest level of the data privacy certification named ccel five-plus but for the applications protection is also very important while we can provide four layers of the protection of their applications later Michael occurs where interests more detail about how to protect the any rias whence when they download the apps and content from our App Gallery G Divya is the most important policy right now how we provide end-to-end gdpr comprise solution cover from the cloud to the devices to the operating system it will give us the most highest level of GDP our compliance just I talked before the news UK we know currently there any users our customers are looking for more local apps local contents instead of the global news the global contents but right now the current ecosystem is not easy people need to go to the current app stores to search it find it download it activate so we believe that is a new opportunity for huawei so we create a totally new strategy we call these local apps for example if you are living in Oslo we can provide the Oslo local apps those apps is edited by our local Norwegian editors so it means all the customers living in Oslo can get the most popular apps and accountants so the local it's our key strategy for our ecosystem so today we introduce the news UK and today my colleague us will introduce more case study how this cooperation with our gallery we know 5g is coming 5g is very exciting what is the 5g can bring to us comparing to the analyst is pressure for the new mobile ecosystem let's take a look consumer are spending less and less time on smartphone because with the 5g coming people were spending more time on a SmartWatch on a tablet smart TV there are not of smart devices we're coming very soon so how to enable the developers to develop one-stop apps on content and it can offer all the scenarios devices that is a challenger the secondly changes people watching content listen a music how to provide a seamless appearance to the consumers that is a second charge so while we all scenario one-stop stretcher together with our HMS were provide a totally new all scenario best experienced both to the customers and developers let's work together to create more secure and a reliable reliable mobile application system I will introduce my colleague Jaime on a stage so he will introduce the change of the current developers they are working on the current mobile ecosystem so how how we can support the developers especially for the some of them big mass of the small and midsize developers can grows together with us in the future thank you let's warm welcome Tommy on stage [Music] thank you very much I hope everyone watching us today is doing great my name is Jaime Gonzalo and my team is in charge of the business growth of our mobile services today we will deep dive into App gallery as the epicenter of our user engagement ecosystem engagement is now more paramount than ever and every developer knows that you know why well to start with there are 2.9 million Android apps out there this is great news for the users so much choice and furthermore every day there are 6,000 new apps being released it is amazing so my question to you is of the six thousand apps released yesterday how many did you download or the day before how many did you download or the whole month that's the thing 50% of users download 0 apps per month on average 25% download less than 2 but definitely not thousands these indicates clearly bottleneck in the user acquisition it is hard for developers to acquire users and no matter how clever is your user acquisition plan how hard is your user acquisition budget in the end users have 80 apps in their phones depending on the country maybe a hundred but not thousands there is a limit you can check on your own phones how many apps you have installed it's going to be around that 2.9 million apps 80 and it's easy to lose them as we see in this graph in my horizontal axis you will see the top app number one to top up number 2.9 million in the vertical one you will see the growth of users so there's a line at the zero percent growth that basically shows the companies above that line grow user base per month companies below that line lose users every month in the square you will see the top two in companies well in the rectangle 2000 companies that grow users every month it means that 99.9% of apps of the world lose users every month conclusion very hard to acquire users very easy to lose users what if I told you there is a solution to that the huawei mobile services the connected engagement ecosystem a web mobile service is a fully interconnected ecosystem of services that basically are designed to go through the full lifecycle of the user in the usage of the phone it will bridge content and users in a way that is pertinent that is contextual that is relevant we make recommendations not ads and you as a developer might think well why should I care I mean yeah this what we is doing what is the advantage for me well let's check the events are several the first one is traffic eyeballs drive money and you know that traffic Jessop gallery alone has four hundred million monthly active users but because they are part of a connected ecosystem and you can be displayed in all our windows we start with an overall monthly base of six hundred million users as my colleague mr. Juan said before you can be exposed to six hundred million users every month second the quality of the download what I'm showing here is the holy grail of many developers being promoted in a top banner of an app store well we think that the kind of install you get the kind of download you get from something like this maybe ends in the churn that I showed before in the retention drop it's much better when you combine this with other windows like personalization wallpapers every time you open your phone you see the identity of a brand seasoning and festivals overall is a fully immersive storytelling across all the windows that we provide number three monetization incentive your work has a value educating the user that your work is for free is not going to help your business so we have created a virtual currency that lives inside our services to make it simple the more movies you watch the more games you can play the more music you listen to the more storage you have to store your photos and your family videos these enables the user to be in a premium stage from day one when they pay will reward the first payment then the second payment is easier it's not get for free then pay is you pay your part of premium we give you back and continue spending because you're a premium quality user number for the engagement beyond the install for us the funnel doesn't end on the download and then good luck for us the final starts with the download because apps behaves as a service you are not an anecdote your story your lifetime value of the user and as such we will continue your story beyond the download through PR activities through events with people like me showing apps like saint seiya that you so like experience tours how many how many retail stores in the world sell our devices we have people queuing in these stores to see innovation to discover the next experience level let us tell your story in these places we have influencer channels these are huawei channel displaying an app which is what bad social activities we combine your community our community together to tell stories of Blackey draws promotions campaigns win a phone very easy and finally if you have appetite for the biggest mobile economy in the world which is china i think it's obvious that we are the right partner to talk to so the question here is okay in my presentation all this looks very nice but what is the result does this really work or is just nice images well I showed the sign say a campaign we launched the game in November in December there was a bit of organic growth by January that we hit a camp and what you see here is a column of revenue we had multiplied a hundred plus times the organic ARPU average revenue per user 47% paid user ratio from all the users who downloaded game 47% paid in the game to put into perspective when a game has a 5% or 10% paid user ratio it's considered a success it starts to be a success 47% values a ratio it's a remarkable achievement the story was written again thanks to our partnership with flexion and gang guns of glory launched the game a couple of weeks of organic growth to set the benchmark and from which 6 to 12 we duplicated the download growth 6 times growth the revenue of the game and 2.6 times the our average spending per paying user very successful and quality downloads not churn but incentivizing monetization finally for us security and privacy of our users are paramount we have designed an end-to-end fully secure ecosystem that takes care of all the steps in the direction with the user starting by before releasing we ensure the identity of the developer the source of the app is it legit make sure that it comes from the right place during the release of the app we make sure there's no malicious behavior malware check terms and conditions that are abused if any kind of bad configuration of the app we avoid one instantly app we secure fully encrypted end-to-end channel to make sure there's no disruption on the service from our servers to your phones and we ensure the integrity of the package and during the use of the app we make sure that everything is satisfactory for the user on top of that we have a full compliance or gdpr with certifications granted by the european union to protect our system the user data the account management and our payment system fully compliant this is great news for the users for the developers however this means that we are probably the AppStore that rejects the most apps in the world last year will reject it 37% of the apps that were submitted to a gallery because they didn't meet the standards of quality of security and privacy that we demand for our users so developers this is my request for you please take security and privacy as seriously as we do we can help you with that but we will not compromise the safety and security of our users to grow our catalogue of apps with that in a nutshell to wrap up remember our ecosystem is about activation engagement monetization not about downloads not about impressions everything I showed in here is free for the developer we don't charge you to be advertised the war of competition for user acquisition budget is over we care about quality you are a small developer you cannot compete with the big ones but you have a good story to tell talk to us we will listen to you you will have a voice with us 600 million active users eighty-five percent revenue share for all in-app purchases and a global expansion of your current Android business not only will which countries that you cannot reach with other Android ecosystems but we also expand beyond the user acquisition and the lifetime of your users with that I will let our partners speak for us so that it's not as to tell you how good experience it is to partner with us what I can tell you is that we don't disappoint so let my colleague my friend andreas from flexion explain to you in this video thank you very much for your attention word flexion mobile the distribution partner for android games we make it easy for game developers to distill the games too many channels we work with top grossing games that we take two leading channels outside google play such as Hawaii app gallery working with awawa has been great for us with solid technical and commercial support throughout results are positive the catalog we represent generates 30 million dollars a month in Google Play and so far we've launched 14 of these games in Afghan or we've integrated the Huawei app gallery kit into our automated enabling technology and this allows us to make games compatible with the app gallery without any work required by the developer key features like Huawei IEP and Huawei ID are added automatically the Huawei kit was easy to integrate and means that we can make pretty much any game compatible with app gallery and together with huar way we maximize the growth potential of mobile games [Music] [Music] hello hello and welcome hello Internet my name is Andreas and I'm going to talk to you more about the the great products that hyman has been introducing to you I'm very happy to introduce to you the new possibilities that we have for you as a developer in 2020 and I want to start by making a promise to you all of our services are built with you the developer in mind so we want to make sure that you can start for free our services are free to register and free to start the basic API calls we want to give you tools that help you develop faster so you can integrate HMS within three development days and last but not least we want to give you the right tools for the right tasks so that you can stay flexible it's always a great pleasure to talk about the great amount of work that our engineers have put into making HMS possible over the last five months they've really achieved something great in just five months we've more than doubled the amount of HMS tipped capabilities from 11 to 24 in the same time the amount of developers that have registered on developer.com has increased to 1.3 million and on the back of that we now have over 55,000 applications that have at least one HMS kit integrated but what is HMS core actually what does it mean HMS core is actually the backbone of our HMS ecosystem we're in a very unique position in that we can provide an end-to-end service to our consumer it all starts with the chipset the Kirin SOC that powers 5g and AI our device software Mui that Matt is going to talk a little bit about later helps with performance connectivity and as you all know world-class photography last but not least huawei mobile services app gallery and HMS apps that Heim has been talking about hms core make up the cloud portion of our end-to-end promise to you hms core is actually the is actually at the center of our consumer and developer ecosystem it connects your content with the huawei consumers across scenarios and across devices we want to give you a unique value proposition with hms core we want to make sure that you can build apps efficiently and quickly we want you to build reliable and safe apps apps that are valuable to your users and finally apps that are smarter by using on device artificial intelligence this is your HMS core toolkit in three pillars we give you the right tools to develop basic services grow and engage your user base and monetize your user base as we travel another circle and Aoife yeah Greg and Napa to tell information immaterial jewelry i'm llamo the entire team to the detriment of religious authority to to the secretary the hms support are almost a disability for suitum into the up gallery what we account keep the location and map in approaches capital a common feature in German economic this television plan there is no a strategy to Integra a renowned strap on HMS she ran this issue remains the prongs of surah from belief eg immediately attract Rudolph and his team at SOS travel were among the pioneers to actually integrate hms core into their applications to date they've implemented account kit to make a seamless login experience for their users they've implemented location kit for super accurate and fast user location service and finally they implemented in app purchases to make frictionless payments for their services in their app we're really happy to partner with them and we hope that the HMS eco system brings a lot of success to their app if you're a frequent traveler I suggest that you download this app and you can find it on App Gallery today apart from the basic services to empower your app we also recently in London in January actually released some new next-generation capabilities firstly we announced quick apps which is an easy way for you to create installation lists tap to use apps based on html5 to minimize the amount of work needed to implement it and second of all we also launched machine learning kit our ml kit which is based on our years of experience working with on device AI it actually gives you easy to implement AI functions that can enhance your app an ecosystem is nothing without you and an ecosystem is nothing without partners so we're we're very proud to have partnered with apps fire kochava adjust unity and others to make sure that our ecosystem has end to end attribution and that development for it is easy and seamless so you can actually use unity to develop your app for HMS but what does it actually take to integrate HMS core into your app well depending on the level of integration we calculate about an average of three mondays per service from registration to application release we can calculate another three days so it is relatively fast to do we would like to invite you today to join our developer community go to huawei developer and register you'll find all of the documentation on the kits you'll find code labs and you'll find direct access to our support and with that let's take a look at the video from one of our partners at Aventa my name is Albert Harris and I'm the CTO of other into Spain in Alinta we're the biggest marketplace player specialists in Europe we are present in 16 countries in Spain we have four main brands with those brands we have 80 million monthly active users we collaborate with Huawei because we think that our strategies are aligned for example in 2017 16 percent of our users who are using Huawei devices today this is up to 25 percent right now we are moving all our apps into the Huawei up gallery and experience is good the support that you are receiving is better than other players we plan to do join marketing campaigns through our or apps and together as we speak three people have been able to find a job through info shops and one of those probably who is using a huawei device hello everybody for me a great pleasure to be here my name is Mathieu Lucia and I am the head of software ecosystem in Europe today I would like to talk about two away HMMs capabilities and how to empower a standout experience but first let's have a look to the market the number of devices that our customer is owning is growing in 2015 you and I were having only two devices a laptop and a smartphone but by 2025 with a development of 5g and IOT our customer are expecting to have more than nine devices you would expect there will be more and more connected but also more and more productive but the reality is different hardware is insulated it's very hard to share content or files between hot between devices today I would like to address three problem hardware limitation content insulation and for streaming performance so let's start by the first one hardware limitation you have a lot of hardware around you with a lot of capabilities and most of our customers are using the smartphone to do everything the reality is you have a TV where the Kavi do experience it's much better you have a laptop where you have a keyboard and mouse we can offer better productivity but you cannot leverage it because the app has been developed for smartphone and leave on the smartphone but with huawei device which position kids you can now leverage any capabilities of every hardware so device nutrition kid extract the capabilities of headway hardware and pull it in full of services that app developer can request as an app developer you cannot offer a true connected and seamless experience you can request microphone for smart speaker you can request a screen from the TV or you can use any hardware with which offer the best customer experience for your application let's take a concrete example Delhi yoga this is a true and existing app which are using our GV kids today our user are doing more and more sport at home they are doing yoga with a device with a smartphone they put it on the floor and the customer experience is definitely not the best they have to have a holder they put it on the floor and then when I do the exercise is just very hard to have visibility on the screen what about to improve this experience what about you innovate to bring the best connected experience to our customers this is what GV kid is about with divagate Delhi Yoga is able to invoke the best screen in your house which is your TV this is the center of your living room is just the best screen to watch when you are doing your exercise with delicates Delhi Yoga is about to embark camera to just track your body position and give you real-time feedback as a real coach will do you can also imagine that in the future they will integrate access to microphone to ask the customer to be able to request more information about position or ask for the next exercise with difficut you have the possibility to truly innovate the second problem I want to address today is about content isolation go away make really sure that you can share files between your smart phone and your laptop seamlessly but the true problem is when a third party third party partner or third party hardware come to play it's just really hard to share files between each other for the first time today who I want to open this capability to third party partner we want our partner to use our innovation to truly enable content sharing we are supporting three platform Android Windows Windows and Linux we work with the best partner in Europe for example see we see we is a number one printing machine in Europe as you know our customers love to take pictures they love to use a smartphone to take landscape picture portraits or their family picture but they also want to be able to print it out to share it with a friend and their family the program today is the experience is really complicated if you walk in the shop and you go to the silly machine is just really hard to share your files from the smartphone to the machine it can take up to 10 minutes or even 20 minutes depending on how many files you want to share with who our share this experience is now 10 second you just select the picture on your phone you can share with whoever share your picture directly to the silly machine and walk out with your printouts [Music] [Music] this is a true example this is what we are doing with our partner we help them to create an innovative solution or to offer a true connectivity experience the last problem I would like to discuss today is about streaming performance as you probably know there is a lot of solution in the markets but if you have tried you would know that it is first really complicated and also not really robust the connectivity is dropping and the customer and the experience is far from being perfect Cass plus has been developed by our engineers keeping in mind what the customer really wants so bad movie gaming and productivity for movie we have kept in mind the problem of connectivity Cass plus has been designed to resist to packet loss up to 20% giving you a true seamless experience even with poor connectivity gaming the main problem is about latency for the first time Huawei has developed a solution with the latency of 15 minutes again giving you a true experience of gaming for any type of games and the last one about productivity our customer are Ottomans ago and they want to be able to be productive anywhere as I go you have most of the time your document or your presentation on your on your smart phone but you want to be able to share it during a meeting this is what Cass plus n able you to do you are able to connect with a smart screen or whiteboard being able to share content and with the reverse control you are able to modify and save seamlessly your content on your smartphone to summarize with the development of 5g and IOT our customer will have for sure more and more devices to in 2025 they will have up to nine devices so what about 2030 2035 for 2014 they will have with no doubt a lot of devices the question is are you ready to embrace connectivity and are you ready to break device boundaries thank you take it spin it watch it fix it work it baby and perfected exploring private lighting pointed shooted snapIt zoomit ultraviolet save its story and securing lucky only and protect explorers explore it grab it drive it plastic jump feeling [Music] [Music] there is always more to it explore it on what we have gallery explore it [Music] welcome to this way developers day almost summit and this panel discussion first of all thank you guys for very nice presentations and thank thank you for inviting me here as a moderator from Norway it's quite an honor to be here I must say honestly I didn't know much about her way but two years ago I the the opportunity to visit your headquarters in China and after getting to know you guys and your plants I'm quite amazed or what's going ahead and one one of questions I have mr. rang is you see that there's you know last 15 years you have had a continuous revenue you increased your sales every year you're among the top 10 most valuable brands in the world could you please tell me a little bit about how did it contribute how did it contribute to this success I think as there is no secret behind paui is a company we always take as a product and a technology as a first priority so we spend more than 10% of the revenue every year to invest the future technology and a product but what's more it's the complete cartridge we are customer centric we always always put our customer as a top priority in the whole company and I think also I think the most important part of the secret maybe could we say is secret is the company is owned by the employees so everybody in a company take the ownership so yeah that is a something different with the other companies and I also see that the company is very focused on a long-term planning the long-term strategies and mr. or could you tell me a little bit about the long-term plan for your way mobile services yes we think it's a very Challenger you know in the past 15 years they are not of this kind of ecosystem investment it's not successful even start off on very big companies so that is the Challenger so we must think in advance and we must to develop a long term strategy so long term strategies that we believe from our customer they need security they need more innovative more high quality more open ecosystem so they need have more choice from the channels from our partners so they very welcomed the competition and the developers and published they need more healthy ecosystem they need to gross more faster compared with current ecosystem yeah so we believe that is our chance but that is not enough we must create our platform to support to help our customer to support the partner and support of the developers to create a new apps on content and to attract any users to download it fund it and activity yeah so Clara for me also long term strategy so and the number three I think as a technology so 5g is coming and the artificial intelligence all scenarios that is the key for the future technology we must build all this technology inside and perform and open to the partners to the developers and ensure they can develop more exciting intelligent apps and contents and provided to our customers yeah very good Thank You mr. Wong thank you I go to the developers and andreas I will ask you can you tell us more work what kind of integration support you provide for the developers yeah sure so maybe I just want to to mention one thing expanding on what mr. Wang said for our Huawei mobile services strategy it's actually something that's been ongoing for quite a while right in Europe as an example we we launched the first services back in 2016 with Huawei ID and we've had you know the continual expansion of the services up until the current service ecosystem you know as I as I presented earlier with twenty four kids now so this is that the very very foundation of what we want to what we want to do right we want to deliver the tools that developers need to build great experiences so the 24 kits are you know that the base for this you know you can you can do you can you can integrate different kind of functions into your apps right whether it's basic development functions like maps whether it's engagement functions like push notifications or whether it's monetization functions like like in-app purchase as as SOS travel did on top of this and we have a very proactive approach in supporting developers right so we have our support teams in each country support engineers that can help with integrations help with questions give it you know the the local the local touch org local touch right and then finally we also have ours remote testing infrastructure so that wherever you are in the world we give you access to to our devices so that you can test remotely through our dgx labs where actually we don't use emulators we actually do real device testing and you can just plug in through your browser into real device and run your app and make sure that it wants very well so we with everything we try to take an end-to-end approach right like with the chipset to the cloud the same kind of approach applies to to how we want to support developers very nice thanks let's move over to you hi my about the app gallery how how is that how do the benefit for developers can you say something about that so before going to the detail of the benefits I think it's interesting to understand why we are doing all this why what is the motivation or the vision of what way to go into this kind of route many would say well there's already a nagger system of app stores out there and it has been working for the last 10 years but what what Waiters is instead of imposing what we think is a good idea is we listen to what is needed we ask the users we saw in mr. Wong's presentation what users need we we ask the developers we have a developer community and we assume what do you guys need developers they need easier development lower effort bigger opportunity users they need more reliable faster easier to use more innovation so what we have designed is a platform there is a bridge between content and the right audience what we have created opposed to an advertisement spamming of banners is a contextual recommendation of pertinent content from the best sources to the right audiences that follows what makes the mobile phone so unique you know what it is is that the mobile phone adapts to your life sourabh gallery is not a standalone app store is part of an ecosystem connected that follows what you need as an example let's imagine that you as a user you need to plan a trip to Japan you need to browse different apps find them search hotel booking taxi booking if you're a millennial a young user a technological user that's very easy for you but there's population that maybe don't know how to find these apps make them remember the name maybe they don't have memory in their phones so we have a system that maybe we'll elaborate later that is our what we assistant our quick apps our artificial intelligence new close that pulls the content of the apps and shows directly what you need we combine the offers of different travel agencies and flight companies to give you the best price for a Japan trip so what we do is basically serve you the best experience not promote a partner that has spent more in advertisement it is a more contextual closer to the user we don't do what we do recommendations app gallery is the center of that nucleus if you want to exist in that ecosystem you need to be in AB calorie that is very important so that is just a good example to explain the scenario solution in the future so travel is a very typical solution yeah typical scenarios I think very very fundamentally actually this is what in my opinion makes a smart phone a smart phone right yeah a phone where you don't have to actually tell the phone what to do anymore but a phone that does the work for you so this is what I consider to be a true true smartphone and that's the kind of vision that we are following and have been following with with on device AI but now also with with our assistant solution yeah and and I think joining who our gallery is not only joining the gallery is about joining huawei innovation and and have we have seen as in customer nobody is complaining about the lack of innovation into the apps marketplace and with the opening of our SMS capabilities we offer a true opportunity to app developer to really innovate and bring a seamless experience across devices with the cusp loss or certificates so I think it's a great opportunity for app developer to really go the extra mile and and really offer an innovative experience for our customer yes we're touching really into some of the statements from the customers just that we saw on the film today and I think one of the key issues there was security privacy can you say a little bit more miss rang about you know the focus on the security you had some good slides about that when it comes to the protection on the apps can you say something more about that yeah I think the most one of the most the concerns of the current user they are very care about the security the privacy security they need a high level protection so while we all are solutions we provide end-to-end solution especially we leverage our Koch abilities like the own device we have the some we call it a trust excuse environment all those sensitive theaters just I mentioned during my presentation like the fingerprint daters like your bank ID although that will be only put into these these trusted places and I want to restate again so Howie is the only smartphone company we get we got the license we go to the approvement of the highest privacy protection industry we call the l5 c c/e AAA or five plus yeah you guys are the first one actually to to reach that yes yes well only one yeah and from this is a form the hardware level and from from that gallery level so we understand we master to make sure the apps published in the app Gary must be safe must be low risk yeah so we develop a totally new process to make sure the apps is safety for example we currently we are developing the technology if some of the apps they download the user download apps so the apps will ask for some authorities like your phone book the camera or your microphone I think they see the typical situation in the android-based smartphone but our plans we want to manage those applications once they apply some authorities they need to give the users the options so user where maybe only give those applications only one time asura case yeah that is a the very important effect we must have to solve this safety issues sorry nerf before move before moving to the next question I think there is a fundamental difference regarding privacy for what way than for many other companies last year there was the legislation of the general data protection the GDP are appearing in Europe these took many companies by surprise many companies had a roadmap of product and services that didn't include that level of privacy and security and they had to change the route and incorporate new features on the way is like trying to add additional bricks to a house what is already built it's complicated many companies struggle with that we don't because our products our services our privacy by design it means that we were already prepared for this level of privacy and security and that's why we get so easily the certifications of the European Union about the level of security because we were planning to be like these already so now we count on certifications from Europe at all the levels what we have built accounts like wow eid payments the system the transmission of data the encryption the fact that is into an encrypted it means well to them will tell you an anecdote it's two things when we decided before GDP are to create the data centers to store the data of users outside of China so like the rest of the world the European users the American users the Latin American users the Middle East users we selected what is the most demanding country the most difficult to please in terms of privacy and security we found Germany so if Germany is happy everyone is happy and that's what our data center is so any private data from any user any photo from any user a family or anything it's not only fully encrypted from the phone to the server and even us owning the servers I couldn't access these photos I would see like the matrix numbers I wouldn't be able to see them but also they are under the supervision of the German government and the European Union to ensure the highest standard on earth of privacy and protection we take it the most seriously if we didn't take a better country or harder than Germany because we couldn't find one so that's how seriously we take it for us it's paramount and as I said in my presentation we have rejected 37% of the app submittals were more because they didn't meet the standards of quality security and privacy we don't we are not interested in growing to millions of apps if these apps can be a detriment of the experience of our users but you're also helping these companies to make sure they're you know really are regulated and everything so you can help developers being compliant with it we provide support it's not like rejection and you don't know why it's more like your terms and conditions should be more restricted to certain areas the use of this data or this behavior of the app is not compliant with the level of security or the expertise we want yes we got developers yes right now a lot of Chinese developers they want to expand in the penis to the OSD market so our knowledge about this GDP are comprised will enable them to know more faster more smoothly to expand their pins to obviously market yeah and I think we are following the same approach when we design new products so it's really about security so we all sit down with the engineering team and design our software to be safe to be secure so we have introduced a thing on screen fingerprint we have 3d face unlock but it's also about how we design our OS so as mr. Wang mentioned we have a different environment for biometric data it's really about security and privacy we really want to offer the best to our customers and we have done the same with with the AI chipsets so we were the first company to compute AI algorithm onboard instead of actually sending data on the cloud and risking a security breach so I think as the philosophy of the company the business model different yeah so we always take as a customer the consumer as a top priority so we don't want to make money from the data from traffic or from all these things so that is why we design our operating system design our emotion you our design the whole mechanism all the pests are to protect our users protected their privacy data's to give to give a totally safety environment yeah yeah so I understand Trust is a it's a big issue and a very important factor here let's move over to the mobile kit mr. Wang there was an announcement about partnership with TomTom for your Huawei mobile service core map it can tell more about the kids that hallway is developing yes I think we just launched our HMS the 24 kids it's a 15th of January yeah all those kids is a fundamental service we muster to provide to the developers and publishers to make sure their apps on the content could be published our capital and our users could be easily to download their service and applications and what's more so in the future we want to we have plain trying to open some of the cool capabilities of Huawei furthermore the camera you know we in the past I think of four years standing for star form p9 so how are we first introduced the dual camera system partnership with alayka so that is the waters Foster to your camera system and to offer our customer the best in class the first of the mobile photography so year by year we improved our capability of camera and video so Ratdog we decide to open the camera technology and capability to our developers we will ensure tavella's can leverage the high technology to develop some more intelligent more high tech apps that is a good example for you yeah very good and at the same time we we are step by step to open some of the like a machine learning and artificial intelligence skin and a lot of kids will be open to all the developers I think I mean with a with the launch of the first chipset with an NP u so a neural processing unit which basically allows you to run AI models on the device we we kind of started a revolution I mean a lot of experts say that that most phones by 2023 will actually have on device AI capabilities this is the kind of like innovation that that I think we we helped kick off and it brings us to a very interesting point I mean you know again back to the strategy what what our strategy is is to to give the best hardware to developers to build the best apps and content for for their customers yeah and our Huawei users so that's kind of like how everything sort of ties together from from a strategic point of view that's really interesting otherwise AI am fascinated can you tell a bit more about the plan going forward with with that so I mean on device AI as I said it's it's it's also something we kicked off some some time ago and but in principle the the idea is that we want to make a smartphone smart right so how do you do that with with AI so in January in London we launched we launched the ML kit and the ml kit allows developers to to integrate AI functions into their apps quite easily so things like like for example face detect or image recognition and the really cool thing about it actually is that we can do a lot of these things as we already said on on device this isn't only good from a privacy point of view but from a developer point of view it's also good yeah because they don't need the server time to kind of like do the calculations and from a user it's good because they don't use data and it's much faster so we're going to continue down that route you know at at the very core of what we do you know the 1 + 8 + n1 the smartphone in the center is powered by AI so it is at the literally at the very core of what we do so it's quite exciting I I love my job I understand I think let me - please I know this event is for developers but since we have given a very technical answer I would like to tone it down a little bit and express the business wrap-up what we said basically where they're seeing two type of developer needs those developers that want to preserve the status quo and keep doing the same as they were doing in the hueco system we have that for them we have all the kids necessary for developers to continue the work adds maps location push payments everything they would need totally autonomous but on top of that we enable capabilities that are not available in other ecosystems thanks to artificial intelligence thanks to our cameras third thanks to our nucleus of intelligence in the processors thanks of FG so we are taking the development capabilities to the next level that the Western world has probably not seen yet yeah so our ecosystem is for the control and for the ambitious for the comfortable because as my colleague Andres explained our applet Connect provides capabilities of development with less effort we have server less development that reduces 50% the development time we have the quick ups that we mentioned but basically to give you an idea about our gap we got from the store you just find it an open a normal Android app you find it click on install download get it in your phone find the icon that makes a difference of open rate open rate of a normal Android app is 10 percent open rate of a quick app is 72 percent so the dual acquisition cost and engagement of the user is much better with our technology so we are offering less effort more opportunity and expand beyond then your capabilities great you got training the next question actually yes can you say a little bit more about what kind of apps is more suitable for quick apps yeah sure I mean I think quick apps is a very exciting format especially for companies that have a very good html5 website because with that you can simply convert your website into a quick app which literally only takes a couple of hours we we even have an own IDE to to do that and we also have a lot of quick app James actually I think for for gaming it's it's a very very interesting field because actually the the amount of code needed to make a quick app is about 20 percent of that of a full Android app and then finally just to touch on one one points that heimer made actually the great thing about a quick app is also that you can scale it to multiple touch points so this is much more difficult if you have a full-fledged app because it's quite heavy it can be quite heavy but a quick app you can actually embed for example in assistant and because it's a non installation it's an installation less application so there's a lot more flexibility that you gain from from it so any developer who's really interested in quick deployment and you know being able to reach multiple touch points with relatively little work yeah for them I would say you know at least take a look at our documentation on quick apps very good I can see we're running out of time but we have one more question if that's okay Matt you were mentioning before about you know support other manufacturer hardware manufacturers how is that possible well I think it's about creating an end-to-end customer experience Ryan it's about creating an ecosystem of devices if it will be just about who our devices we we as a company don't believe that would be possible so we want to work really closely with all the partners and with all the hardware manufacturers and see we is a really good example you know it's what our customer want our customer loves take picture but they also want to be able to print it out and share it and his feedback that we are receiving from our customers so we wanted to work really closely with them to bring a delightful and unique experience for our customers and we are sharing our technology so share is something we had in our in our I would say core services but we want to share it with partner to bring this experience as well so you will say it I mean as we have seen on my video is it it's just 10 second now before it was between 10 and 20 minutes which is definitely better for our customer and force their user as well I think I would add one more comments though you know right now in a Europe there are a lot of traditional English for example alayka the partnership with lacquer we recreate some of the images of this traditional industry would bring some of the digital Internet to the traditional family at least this industry so that is maybe could be the benefit for the local society yeah another example is currently in a Europe they are very fragmented a lot of currencies languages so how to unite and to give more local like the developers more support that is a we believe this is also one of the important regions and opportunities for Huawei to create such a totally new ecosystem yeah and that's what you were mentioning right there Gokul yes perspective I love your comment about Oslo since I'm from there so it's very very interesting I think we probably have to wrap up now thank you so much for a very interesting discussion Jaime Matt mr. Vong another yes thank you for inviting me here and I you know I can't wait to follow you you guys the success going on forward and keeping you know the dialogue with the developers the partners and and I'm very happy to be here with you guys so thank you very much and thanks for for this online summit thank you thank you very much thank you [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] no videography Up next, 5G is coming Of course, you'll immediately be thinking of the boyband the 5Gs Remember? Gerad, Gijs, Gert, Guus en Sjoerd Who was actually named Govert Wonderful boys, wonderful music. But I'm referring to 5G mobile data, the successor of 4G, which is waaaayyyy faster mobile internet 5G is coming: superfast internet that will drastically change our lives It's so fast even, it has such little delay, that a doctor should be able to perform a surgery without having to be present in the operating room Oh yeah, chill! Yeah That way the doctor doesn't have to go all the way into the operating room Because that used to be so annoying! Pff, horrible And maybe you're thinking: "Fuck that, I'm not a doctor, I just want to download some shit!" "How much faster will I be able to do that with 5G?" "Just so I can compare" Just for your comparison,  this is the difference when you try downloading the new Ed Sheeran album Bam!  0.2 seconds! And that's also immediately a big disadvantage  of 5G You blink and suddenly you have Ed Sheeran on your computer So, a music album in 0.2 seconds But also a whole season of your favorite show. Game of Thrones, or in my case, Kees & Co within half a minute However,  there also disadvantages "But there's a catch: this fast internet travels on tiny wavelengths." "5G can only travel a very short 300 meters" "So future networks will need thousands of mini base stations everywhere, all over a city to relay the signals" Yeah, so 5G is faster, but it also has a much more limited reach More antennas will be needed In a city such as Tilburg alone, for example Eindhoven, an estimated 2500 antennas will be needed to be attached to street lights, bus stops, etc. That's a lot of work, and it also causes some distress Even so, there's mostly growing distress on the internet about 5G. Sometimes, based on fake news. "Hundreds of birds have fallen from the sky in The Hague, The Netherlands, during a 5G experiment" Yeah There's distress over the radiation caused by 5G As with 3G, 4G, Wifi, and the steam train, people are afraid they'll get sick from it That video on the dead birds caused a lot of panic, but they didn't die due to a 5G experiment Because those birds were in The Hague and in The Hague, no 5G experiments were conducted It was a hoax Who falls for that? The first experiments concluded in some worrying results in relevance to the well-being of birds in the vicinity of 5G transmission towers The fun part of a hoax is hearing the most unexpected people talking about bird well-being But in reality, there's no reason to think radiation from mobiles can cause damage Science has conducted about 4500 researches on this matter since the 1950s And what we see is that in the last 30 years, even though we have started using more mobile phones and have started placing more Wifi routers in our homes We see no effects Thousands of researches have been conducted, the World Health Organization compared a large amount of those researches And found not even one piece of evidence that this kind of radiation can be damaging Even so Even so, there is a reason for distress when it comes to 5G Not the boyband, people, they are still together It's all great But there's a reason for distress when it comes to 5G But why? Well, that's hard to say Very hard even Exactly Exactly, yet Huawei you want to pronounce it, the Chinese electronics producer Huawei wants to build our 5G network The antennas, the transmission stations, the central routers, Huawei is very good at it They are winning the 5G race They spend an estimated 15 billion euros on research and development on a yearly basis That's more than the most prominent competitors, Ericsson and Nokia, combined Huawei is already delivering superior 5G technology and for a rather alluring price Yes, a very Hold on, where is it? Oh, there it is. Alluring price So, Huawei is the cheapest Of course, but you also have to admit, they are the best You pay less, but then you also have a better product It's really about what you want And now you're thinking: "Great! Huawei needs to build our 5G network!" But if that's such a good idea? Now that the world is working on an even faster network, Huawei is in the lead on being able to deliver But more and more Western countries are afraid that the Chinese government is using the company for espionage Yeah, so they look like the best option, but they can't be trusted And how do I know this? Because they're Chinese And yeah, that sounds xenophobic, but I was told by RTL Z The Chinese. They are stealing our data For years, hackers from China were targetting at least 24 companies The Chinese secret services are involved in hacking Dutch company and government agencies That's what the Dutch secret services, the AIVD, reports The AIVD, they've been warning us that China has been hacking us like crazy for years Just like Iran, Russia, and North-Korea China may not be the enemy officially, but they have been attacking us And Huawei says: "That's about the country China, we're just a company." But it's a bit more complicated Because, for the Chinese,  the difference between company and government is sometimes  rather hard to see In China, company and state are not as separated as we're used to Chinese laws have been written in a way that the Chinese government can interfere with these companies And force the companies into doing certain things According to experts, it is unthinkable that a company this big has no connections to the government That's rather shocking Imagine Mark Rutte worked for Unilever for several years and that the dividend- this is not a good example Since a couple of years, every Chinese company is required to help the government spy That still doesn't prove that Huawei is actually doing this and Huawei has been denying for years But fact of the matter is that it is a Chinese company and that makes Huawei kind of scary In addition, Huawei has been accused of theft of company secrets on multiple occasions Which is in line with what the AIVD keeps seeing At this moment, The Netherlands has to choose between Huawei or another 5G creator Because in Europe we also have 5G technology by the Scandinavian Ericsson and Nokia And, of course, that sounds more like something from the old days then something from the future But, yeah Imagine how hard you can Snake with 5G And, yes, the Scandinavian shit is more expensive and of lesser quality But there is less of a chance espionage So we must choose as The Netherlands And when I have to make a hard decision, the first thing I think of is: "What would other people do?" I started doing this after I showed up dressed inappropriately at a baby shower How should I have known, I thought: "We're going to take a shower." How should I have known What are the other countries doing with Huawei? The US is the clearest "Huawei is something that's very dangerous" "You look at what they've done from a security standpoint, from a military standpoint, it's very dangerous" Hey, look! They also have prinsjesdag What a boring hats Okay, well, America wants nothing to do with Huawei and they are not the only ones Australia, New Zealand, and Japan also don't want the Huawei 5G network And there are also countries that want to keep out Huawei from the 5G core Such as Germany, the United Kingdom, known because of 'Order! Order!' remember? Them. And France. And there are also countries want Huawei's 5G network Russia, for example. That's Putin Turkey, Erdogan It's also a bit about who you want to side with Bolsonaro is also green. Mohammed Bin Salman from Saudi Arabia. Duterte But also in Europe: Franco, Mussolini And within The Netherlands, there's one township who says: "Were not going to do anything with Huawei" We find that much too dangerous." (Said in the dialect from Groningen, the most northern province) Rotterdam That's logical, because if the harbor start's running completely on 5G in the future China might be able to watch along or turn everything off The AIVD as well says:  "Don't buy Chinese 5G appliances" And the NAVO warns: "Be careful with the Chinese" And before you take out your Hauwei phone and throw it in the blender This is not about phones, but about the 5G network It's now the government's call Do we, as The Netherlands, want to work with Huawei or not? And when I hear Mona Keijzer of Economic Affairs, I begin to worry But don't we already know there are problems? The AIVD warns for Chinese company espionage RTL Nieuws noted yesterday that Chinese hackers, affiliated with the government, broke into government agencies That should be enough warnings, shouldn't it? - Well, they're no saints They're no saints? Dear Mona, sometimes that's not what you want to hear "Honey, did you get a baby sitter?" "Yes I did, they're upstairs. They're no saint, but everybody deserves a second chance" "The cab's here!" We're talking about people who want to build our while digital infrastructure Recently, 112 (emergency phone number/services) was down because of an internet malfunction That already caused complete chaos and even deaths But if we get 5G and it's taken down because we're fighting with the creators All self-driven cars will come to a halt, our payments won't come through, the supermarket won't be able to order their supplies But The Cabinet keeps refusing to take hard actions against Huawei And, of course, it's complicated Because even when you decide: "Alright, I'll take the more expensive and slightly worse 5G internet from Scandinavia" "Even if it takes a little longer to download a season of Kees & Co" You'd have to ban Huawei and other companies from constructing here When we're doing a lot of business with China So you don't want to insult them The Cabinet even have a "China strategy", which mainly says that we should trade a lot Because China needs a lot of microchips and we're very good at making them So that's trade But the difficult part is that China also has a "China strategy" And the clock is ticking "Made in China 2025, now check it out. It's a ten-year program" Made in China 2025 The goal of the Chinese government is to no longer rely on Western technology as fast as possible And in 2025, China wants to be able to make almost everything by themselves That explains why they have been hunting our company secrets Our strategy is to remain friends and to trade, and their strategy is to become completely self-sufficient But this, this is This is like a garage where its best customer from time to time takes some of its tools "Yeah, I'm not going to say anything about it. He's a very good customer!" And then, after a while,  the customer opens up his own garage on the other side of the street and never stops by anymore Think about that And if we then install their 5G network, they'll have us by our digital balls Okay, so, there's enough reason to be afraid of 5G Not because of radiation, but because you shouldn't take one of our first necessities of life and entrust it to people who "aren't saints" And now I could say: "Government, watch out for Huawei!" But there are people who can do a way better job then I can And that's why I have invited my favorite boyband. Here they are, the 5Gs! This was Zondag met Lubach Thank you for watching, have fun this week and see you next Sunday! The 5Gs! Did you like this video? You're sadly not the only one, so be quick and score a subscription on this channel while stock lasts Which is kind of long Click here so I recently asked the following question on Twitter what is the first thing that comes to your mind when you think about Huawei and I got a lot of different response some people said they've never heard of it before some said it's a great phone some said espionage some said it's a terrible phone a few people thought it was a vacation spotlight they thought it was Hawaii but the real question is why is President Donald Trump signing an executive order calling Huawei a threat to national security why what's the big deal about them why is the director of NSA FBI CIA saying hey American users do not touch the device if it's Huawei don't even get close to it why are so many people around the world from the intelligence community worried about wow wait what is it is there something you and I don't know about it's that the tariffs again is it a trade war is it maybe a cyber war maybe somebody's spying on you and I what is it we're gonna get into that today before I get into it you may be asking is a pad why do I need to know about Huawei a few different reasons number one this could cause a market correction of 10 20 30 percent if it doesn't work out number two its cybersecurity privacy it's a big part of this so you kind of want to know what's going on here and last but not least conversation start in the world of business people gonna ask about huawei you not have an opinion about it having said that let's get into it first I'm going to talk about nine reasons why they were banned then we're gonna talk about their numbers then we're going to talk about 5g then timeline of what took place with Huawei from 1987 to today so having said that let's get into nine reasons number one espionage why espionage is China using Huawei to spy on US and other countries is that really what it is number two competition is this u.s. is way of protecting their golden child of Apple which is cost Tim Cook and Donald Trump to become texting terms today they're best friends because Tim Cook just met with Donald Trump on June 13th on Thursday and they're having conversations why because Apple's the golden child company a Steve Jobs Steve Wozniak everybody uses their phones I would much rather have Apple win then why we win could it be Iran violating the US sanctions because of what happened in China with the CFO we'll talk about that later on is that 5g is it first - is it who gets 5g first and how much is that worth - the GDP whichever country gets 5g first is it power worldwide domination it's its cyber war insurance policy because what if a cyber war happens this is our way of the CIA the NSA and the FBI preventing us of somebody else a major empire that went from being tapped into not being taught the second place and wants to be the most dominant Empire worldwide spying on America this is our way of saying hey you cannot come and find out what we're doing here stealing trade secrets similar going back to made in China 2025 plan which is any company that wants to do business in China they have to kind of give their trade secrets is this kind of part of that or last but not least is a terrorist what is it so before we get into some of these topics let's look at numbers here's numbers for you worldwide smartphone markets okay 2018 Samsung was number one worldwide they saw 292 million phones okay that's 20.8% of marketplace 2018 Apple sold two hundred and eight point eight million which is roughly fifteen percent of market share while we saw two hundred six million phones which is fourteen point seven percent Pat what's the big deal here here's what's the big deal two hundred and six million phones and many people watching this you've never heard a while way before maybe you have maybe you haven't but huawei's third place yes but here's what's important look at 2017 where they were at Samsung so three hundred and seventeen point seven million they were twenty one point seven percent of market share Apple so two hundred fifteen point eight million they were fourteen point seven Huawei was 154 million they were ten point five percent which means Samsung is down eight percent Apple is down three point two percent Huawei is up thirty three point six percent that is such a big number that's plus fifty million phones in one year when your competition is down three point two percent any competitions down eight percent when I looked at this I said okay two hundred six million phones they sold their up 50 million the US government bans any US companies of doing business with Huawei but what is their risk are they so much in u.s. that this gives them a hard time to do business or are they more in China so let's look at the numbers you have total smartphone sold in China 2018 here's what it looks like 2018 while we sold 105 million phones okay which made them 26.4% of all China market share an apple so thirty-six point three million they're nine percent and the year before Apple so forty-one million and the year before while we sold ninety point nine million look at this number you know this app was down 11% and Huawei is up about fifteen sixteen percent so so so let's take a look at this so if they sold a hundred and five million phones Huawei in China alone and total it's 206 what percentage is that fifty one percent which means fifty-one percent of their phone sales is strictly in China so I know the u.s. banned US companies of doing business with Huawei but 51% is in business they're doing is in China and 49 percent is outside of China very small in America if any is in America Europe other countries right now watch Apple here at Apple's two hundred and eight million phones 36 million was sold in China which is 17 percent so here's the scary thing US government banned US companies from doing business with Huawei what would happen if China said listen this whole tariff thing is getting a little control we are going to ban Chinese companies from doing business with Apple what would that do to them because iPhone users they are actively 900 million iPhone users worldwide according to Apple added a 900 million active 300 million is coming out of China let me say that one more time at a 900 million active iPhone users 300 million is coming from China that's 33% that's gonna be a very big hit if China decided to turn it around on them this is one of the reasons why Tim Cook and Trump are meeting together so regularly because if all of a sudden China makes a decision like that that's like a tariff on steroids against Apple and Apple is the biggest company they tanked the market tank so it's very fickle right now if this doesn't take place here and they figure out a resolution but let me continue these are the numbers we're looking at here while we in sales so in 2010 while we sold three million phones then they sold twenty billion next year 30 to 50 to 75 108 139 153 and in 2018 obviously they saw 206 million phones their total revenues in 2018 was 108 point five billion dollars that's up 21% from 2017 and if you look at the total numbers of phone sold it's 780 million phones sold during that eight-year run that they went out so now you look at this thing safe huh it's pretty impressive I mean this is good stuff but what did they do differently I mean isn't it just cell phones watch the amount of money they put into R&D research and development Intel in 2018 put thirteen point five billion in R&D Apple put fourteen point to Apple monstrosity put fourteen point to Microsoft trillion dollar company fourteen point seven huawei 108 billion revenues put fifteen point four billion and this is China labor we're talking about this is not us engineer cost this is China labor we're talking on let me put that in perspective for you added there one hundred and eighty eight thousand employees that they have 75 thousand of their employees strictly focused on rnd again 75 out of 188 is strictly R&D so after while we have Samsung sixteen point seven then alphabet 21 then Amazon at the top of 20 point eight billion into R&D so you look at all this stuff you know okay I mean I get it good products that they're constantly researching they're trying to get better they can't really do business in us right now so what is I'm still not getting a pad what is the big deal with these guys what is the worry here's what it is February of 2019 this is what President Trump tweeted I want 5g and even 6g technology in the United States as soon as possible it is far more powerful faster and smarter than the current standard American companies must step up their efforts or get left behind there is no reason that we should be lagging behind on something that is so obviously the future I want the United States to win through competition not by blocking out currently more advanced technologies we must always be the leader in everything we do especially when it comes to the very exciting world of technology let me read one sentence of this tweet again go back to I want the United States to win through competition not by blocking out currently more advanced technologies what does that mean I mean isn't it banning Huawei actually banning a better technology that's coming into u.s. is that a good thing or bad thing why are we doing that but he wants 5g and 6g and what's the big deal about 5g what is five G what wand you what was 2g here's what's the difference 1g was the brick phones back in the days that's what one she was to G was the old Nokia phones and a few other phones that were 2g 3G this is where the speed comes in if you wanted to download a two-hour movie on a 3G phone it would take you 26 hours if you wanted to download a two hour movie on a 4G phones it would take you six minutes but if you want to download a two hour movie on a 5g phone it'll take you three point six seconds boom you have the movie sitting there iPad 5g I want to watch this movie one two three boom you have the movie go watch it that's 5g and that's scary and by the way 5g is not about phones only five g's about a lot of different technologies gonna be using for surveillance cars GPS mapping technology internet faster internet also many different things they're gonna be using with this but again what's the big deal about this 5g here's the big deal about 5g when the race was taking place for 4G us got it and if I said oh my gosh u.s. won the race for 4G you know how much it made us one hundred billion dollars to add it to the GDP okay into the GDP let me tell you what the race for 5g is whoever wins it whoever wins the race to 5g it is three million jobs added to added to US economy and it's 500 billion dollars added to the top line revenue GDP that's the race of 5g so why everybody's after but there's a big problem right now here's a problem the race for 5g China is already testing their 5g technology and they are projecting that they will be done by 2020 there'll be the first country to be done with 5g 2020 okay everybody else u.s. Japan South Korea EU everybody else is projected to finish by 2025 this is a scary thought but if they finish by 2025 that's a long time for that to be taking place that is an advantage so if they win the contract for 5g they can go out and give it to 57 different countries and say we're not giving it to us but we're giving it to these other countries so China eventually can catch up by 2025 and pass us and be the dominant and power worldwide you don't think there's thinking about that that's a message they made when the Olympics was in China and they did the most amazing opening show they want to compete they want America to know we can compete with you we're not worried about you this is very very competitive right now right and by the way for some of you guys I use AT&T in US and you may say but my phone says 5ge that's AT&T just changing the name of LTE to 5ge it's a fraud it's not really a 5ge it's really a 4G but they just change the name to 5g for people to say I got a 5g phone you can go research and look it up for yourself which is brilliant by the way but it's not really brilliant because it's not 5g so now this is all the stuff we're looking at the 5g issue now let's look at the timeline let's look at the timeline how this whole thing took place and how we got here while we got started back in 1987 by the founder Ren Schenk PHA which by the way he's to be part of the Chinese military and he openly talks about the fact that he supports the Communist Party very open about it so in December of 2001 Indian intelligence accused Huawei of aiding Taliban we're talking 2001 that's 18 years ago they're already having issues with an intelligence community of India then you go to 2003 they decide to start selling phones okay fine 2003 Cisco decides to sue away for unlawfully copying intellectual property this is something they've been accused of many times but the first one goes back to 2003 then in October of 2007 Bush administration warned on huawei 3.com deal they didn't want this deal to be taking place so eventually after a couple years I think three comments up doing the deal with you will Packard but not Huawei okay this next one's a little bit weird and interesting at the same time October of 2010 former UK intelligence boss Andrew Hopkins joins Huawei we're talking former UK intelligence boss not just anybody this guy's got 40 years plus experience in intelligence worldwide you want to go work for Huawei why is why we're trying to recruit you why are you trying to get into the UK in formation what's the purpose beyond is it just because you got a fancy degree or maybe you got access to certain information that can help Huawei huh makes you think doughnut March 2012 Huawei banned from Australian National Broadband Network another one September of 2012 David camera brokers a 1.2 billion pound deal with Huawei I don't want to read too much into it maybe they're just doing something because they want the technology to be stronger and you came that could be it could be as simple as that but 1.2 billion UK after the head of intelligence it a bit weird there okay July of 2013 former CIA head Michael Hayden slams Huawei publicly slams Huawei saying this is not a company anybody should trust March 2017 WikiLeaks vault 7 release feature Huawei backdoors this is when people started seeing some things with CIA and wait a minute what is really going on with Huawei I mean it was a very big red flag maybe all these accusations that people are making is accurate February 2018 director of CIA NSA and FBI warned US citizens against using any Huawei products ok so now this is when it starts getting interesting April 2018 America alleges possible Iran sanctions violations from Huawei the guy I think something's going on here this is when you know when US has a sanction against Iran diamonds you can you cannot do business with Iran and do business with us but they were trying to kind of go around and figure out a different creative way of a subsidiary company to use which we'll get to here in a minute as well May 2018 pentagon bans Huawei ZTE devices from military base ok so now this is when things start getting ugly December of 2018 the CFO of Huawei mank wengie which is also the daughter of Wren the founder of Huawei gets arrested in Cameron why does she get arrested in Canada well because we're longer some US was trying to get her and she was evading us and finally u.s. calls on Canada see you got arrest her and she got arrested why does she get arrested because they were using potentially allegedly they were using a company called sky comm which is a subsidiary they say it's not but it's a subsidiary of Huawei that we're using sky come to do business with Iran so this causes the chairman of Huawei in January 2019 to say the following no market can keep us away is he insinuating that the 5g is going to be so strong that even US has to figure out a way to do business with us I don't know but he said no market can keep us away and may 15 2009 teen Trump signs the executive order banning any US company of doing business with Huawei and that's what brings us to where we are today so look you just had an information overload you've been given so much if and inform us you're sending you're saying holy moly I had no idea this was taking place with Huawei but let's talk about the spy part you know spying espionage you may say what Pat you mean to tell me people are spying on us you got simple questions to ask yourself would you rather have China spy on you or would you rather have us spy on you what do you mean if you use Huawei phones in u.s. maybe China has the ability to spy on you are you okay with China spying on you or if you use an Apple phone are you okay with Apple being able to spy on if somebody says there's no way in the world that can do that isn't that illegal let's just say it is illegal there's a reason why people put band-aids on their cameras of their computers you're not comfortable someone's watching me right or are we more receptive to being spied on today or is this a new thing it's been around for a while if you try to figure that part out you're gonna start watching conspiracy theory movies are gonna drive yourself nuts and all of a sudden you know start having nightmares that and I not sleeping sweating all night long right here's another question of our spine would you rather have a private corporation spy on you or government spy on you if a private corporation spies on you they do it all the time on Facebook how do they do it what is your buying patterns they're simply spying on you to get more money out of you that's what corporations do right but if a government spies on you what did they spy on you for your next moves controlling you seeing what you're doing I mean these smart phones that we have these fitbit's we put on isn't like a you know device to kind of track where we're going so the point I'm trying to make you is the following spying if you go to the rabbit hole of spying you're gonna go so into deep you're gonna get more scared about what could happen to you that's the spying part okay but let me talk to you about what I really thinks taking place and what I think the president the administration Tim Cook and these companies need to be focused on today and that is 5g because this is the biggest thing this 5g is the real issue let me explain why China gets 5g in 2020 and say they give it to 57 different countries and not us and we don't get it five years later and what if they say we don't want to do anything forget about it and all of a sudden other countries in Europe South America start contacting them to do business with Huawei because they got 5g and they broker deals like the Prime Minister David Cameron Cameron brokered a deal of 1.2 billion pounds with Huawei what if other countries start doing this what if all of a sudden everybody has 5g everybody has incredible technology and US has last five years what if they go to every one of these guys EU South Korea Japan and they do it with them but not with us so now watch what happens when you're raising money and you deal with investors here's what takes place you the entrepreneur the owner the shareholder the investor comes in you have 20 different markers to negotiate with I want this much money no problem we wants just much equity no I want fewer equity to give it to you no I want this much no ok I'll give you this equity less but I want to get dividends on the 20 million that I gave you it has too much difference because it adds up to this yes it does ok I want 3 board seats no way I'm giving you 3 but I'm gonna give it to so you go through the whole thing and you the investor or you the entrepreneur have to decide which one you want to give up u.s. is not in a power position with everything I know it may seem like it but they're not very simple and this this is the scariest part with the 5g so President Trump his administration with all the advisors Tim Cook they all have to sit down and figure out what they're willing to give up and what they're not willing to give up because if they just go and say I want all of it it may crack 2030 percent okay it may crack because they're gonna ask for something because they have something that US doesn't have and that's five geniune in a Europe that's massive so the tariffs you want to put 25 percent on this 25 percent on this I put 25 percent our soybeans you put two and we can go back and forth all we want but we got to sit in a room and lay all these things out and US has got to say to them here's what we're doing I'll cut the tariffs but you got to give me a hundred percent of the 5g license to us 2021 you get it we get it as well there's no way normal I'm giving you I wanted right off the bat when you get it I'm not doing it okay give it to me six months after you get it but you cannot do business with anybody else but you can get a head start in China just not anybody else we're not doing it that's that's the negotiation of getting 5g to five years because we don't have any u.s. quoc we're not ahead there's a lot of people that are a lot of companies that are doing it we're not ahead they got to figure out a way to get this technology that's how big it is it's five hundred billion dollars five hundred billion dollars to the GDP three million jobs to the GDP the battle is gonna be a big battle it's gonna be interesting who wins this battle but it's all about leverage and they have the leverage on 5g and they have the leverage on having a population of 1.5 billion people and us has got 330 million and they have a leverage of their smartphone it's not as expensive as the iPhone is we're Tim Cook is saying I'm gonna make the iPhone cheaper in China so I can compete with them there's a lot of leverage and I hope all the brains can come together and figure this part out because me I'm just an entrepreneur giving this information to you so having said that if you watch this video you want to go a little bit more into it and find out more about the US China trade where I made a video titled us-china trade what you're gonna enjoy watching this video it's gonna get very detailed into the tariffs if you haven't watched it click on this if anything we talked about today especially timeline you want to go more into it we're gonna put the links below and if you haven't subscribed to the channel please click on the subscribe button to sub to value tainment thanks for watching everybody love you the huawei mate x2 you probably thought that folding phones were gonna take a break during the pandemic or maybe you didn't think about folding phones at all could kind of go either way with this one huawei just released the second version of their folding smartphone and this time around the large screen is on the inside instead of the outside inside the box we get a nifty little half case that matches the color of the phone as well as a powerfully fast 66 watt charging brick and some corded usb-c headphones at just shy of three thousand dollars it costs about a thousand bucks more than samsung's folding smartphone but you do get this sweet little kickstand which might just be worth a thousand dollars to some people everybody's different it's time for a durability test this video is sponsored by audible let's get started [Music] as i'm starting up the phone we get this list full of good ideas for my durability test like do not press on the screen with hard or sharp objects and this one down here don't expose your phone to sand i'm sure these are good warnings for the average person who wants their phone to last but we're here to find out if the phone can last weirdly enough this thing is shaped like a carrot i wasn't expecting that apparently it's supposed to help with the weight and balance or something when using it one-handed there are also some carbon fiber supports inside and i will have to look for during the teardown closed up and folded shut it's just a tad smaller than my almost two-year-old note 10 plus and just about the same thickness as my phone inside of its teardown grip case from dbrand it's interesting that the entire x2 is basically the same size as my phone in a case yet has three times the screen real estate the folding action itself feels a bit easier to maneuver than the fold two as well as the crease in the center seems to be a bit more gentle not as sharp i'd compare the two if my fold two is still alive but it's not speaking of dying it's time for the scratch test huawei has given us a removable plastic screen protector on the front display very nice of them we know that with the mohs scratch test a plastic screen would start scratching at level two or three a glass screen would scratch at a five or six and a sapphire screen would scratch at a level eight or nine and as we can see from the scratches at a level six with deeper grooves at level seven this front display on the x2 is made from tempered glass it can use glass on the surface since it's not doing any bending the larger inner display however is doing a lot of bending and we start seeing marks at a level two with deeper grooves at a level three since it's so soft my level three pick is pretty much just cutting into the plastic and it's also pretty much just what we were expecting with once again my fingernail being able to leave marks on the surface of this inner screen folding phones are super cool of course they just need a little more tender loving care than your average smartphone and i don't see that changing much in the near future for this inner screen at least the outer screen is pretty much business as usual with the glass protecting its 16 megapixel front-facing camera there's also a plastic earpiece grille up here and the size of the x2 are made from metal the power button is scratchable along with the metal volume rocker it's kind of cool that we can test both the left and right sides of the phone at the exact same time the top of the phone has one of those dual loudspeaker grille as well as a sim card tray which has a proprietary nano memory card slot built in the metal spine of the phone has no branding which is kind of refreshing [Music] and then we have the back glass with the super large camera bump up in the top left corner and finally the bottom of the phone has its usbc port and the second stereo loudspeaker i do like that this x2 has more of a teardrop shaped cavity for the screen to fold into the sharper and more abrupt the crease the more likely it is that the plastic and pixels are to fatigue and crack over time so this softer curve should help the x2 last longer the hinge also wants to be closed or opened all the way it's not multi-positional like the galaxy fold is which is something to consider there are plenty of cameras though this big boy up here is a 10 times optical zoom periscope camera then we have the 50 megapixel main sensor a 16 megapixel ultra wide and a three times optical zoom down at the bottom with the dual colored led flash all sitting inside the rather large camera bomb one thing that's rather hard to avoid here on earth though is earth itself you're kind of going to find earth wherever you go so finding out how dust proof this hinge really is is definitely worth our time with how many gears and precision engineering components are inside of the hinge one grain of sand could really mess things up we'll make sure that the dust is sufficiently jiggled up and shaken around it's interesting that the diagonal seam of the x2 is so tight that it's not letting the dust escape which means it would probably do a decent job of keeping the dust from entering as well hopefully otherwise it would turn into a three thousand dollar etch-a-sketch even with this foray into the sandpit though the hinge has stayed pretty clean and smooth without any discernible noise difference or grinding of gears nice work huawei there is dust resistance let's turn up the heat a little from what i've seen people are in three tribes concerning folding phones some people are all about them some people hate them and some people couldn't care less personally i think i'd be using one if the price point was in the same ballpark as the average flagship which right now it's not the 6.4 inch 90hz front display lasted about 25 seconds under the heat from my lighter before going white and not recovering humans have been dividing themselves up into opinionated tribes since the dawn of time i recently finished an audiobook from audible called ac dc by tom mcnichol the savage tale of the first standers war where he very interestingly explains how brutal the alternating current and direct current debates were back in the late 1800s when humans were learning to harness electricity tesla westinghouse and edison pretty much shaped the course of global history and it got pretty intense they even electrocuted an elephant just to prove a point things were pretty weird back then you can listen to this audiobook yourself with a free 30-day trial of audible at audible.com jerryrig or by texting the word jerryrig to 500-500 every month you'll get one free audiobook and full access to the audible plus catalog which has podcasts fitness and meditation programs and all kinds of audible originals but for real ac dc is a really good listen and it shows that fiery tribal-like opinions have been around for a really long time audible.com jerryrig or text j-rig to 500-500 and huge thanks to audible for sponsoring this video as you can see the inner screen doesn't last near as long under the flame without the glass to dissipate the heat the plastic covered pixels go black and permanently die after about 10 seconds the inner screen is just more fragile than the exterior screens finally the bin test the x2 is a pretty beefy boy when the phone is closed so there's no surprise that there's no flex from either side and then of course we have the open and closing motion between the two halves which means we're done the phone does bend there's no need to test anything else right it definitely folds thanks a ton for watching oh you want to see if it bends the other direction i guess that can be arranged the hinge still feels good and solid even after our dust adventures but i personally don't have high hopes for this thin carrot sticking looking tablet to survive the bend test in the wrong direction but when bent from the back the two halves meet in the center with the hinge giving some pretty solid internal structure and the mate x2 is unable to fold in the wrong direction which is pretty impressive considering we've already had two non-folding gaming phones fold in half this year at this point a folding phone is more durable than a gaming phone minus the softener screen part my current phone is about two years old at the moment and still going strong so i think i'll keep it for another year or two but after that i'll most definitely consider a folding phone as my daily driver especially with how far we've come in the past two years it'll be cool to see where we end up in the next few assuming we can all work together long enough to end the pandemic of course either way nice work huawei hit that subscribe button so you don't miss the teardown and come hang out with me on instagram and twitter thanks done for watching and i'll see you around [Music] hey what's up mkbhd here you know what sucks not being able to recommend a phone no matter how good it is see every time huawei drops a new phone i feel like the conversation we all have is the same thing over and over which is it's a great piece of hardware and they made these advances and here's some new features but if you live outside of china you probably shouldn't get it and even if you do the experience is so gutted that is just not worth it and so what do you know believe it or not they just dropped the mate 40 pro and to me this phone this is the ultimate expression of like no matter how good their new phone is it's impossible to recommend which sucks because this phone has some really technically impressive stuff you can see this new color slash finish here on the back of this one they call it mystic silver and it has this sheen to it that reflects like pretty much every color of the rainbow depending on what angle you hold it which is technically impressive then around the front you see the huge display a roughly 2k 6.76 inch oled display with a 90 hertz refresh rate fingerprint reader underneath the glass of course and then they're doing what they did last year with the mate series which is curving that display right over the edges until it like melts into the side of the phone now you all know how i feel about actually using curved displays they create unnecessary accidental touches they can be frustrating they cost more and they're more fragile but huawei's sticking with it basically because they look so dramatic like this one's again curved so much that they had to move the power and volume buttons further back on the phone and sometimes even the content on the display or the keyboard itself that you're typing on is like melted off of the side inconvenient but technically impressive then around the back there's even more you can see the camera bump they're calling this a space ring design inspired by the first photo of a black hole which might be a bit of a stretch but it's definitely a unique design for the four cameras that they've put up in this phone and because it's in the middle actually it has the unique benefit of not rocking as much as most other phones that put the camera bump in the corner and the cameras include a 50 megapixel massive primary sensor one over 1.28 inches that's nearly rx100 one inch sensor size so very technically impressive then there's a 5x periscope telephoto lens there's a macro camera and there's a 100 degree ultrawide camera even the speakers on this phone go the extra mile so typically on a flagship phone you'll see like the speaker grill at the bottom and then maybe an earpiece stereo speaker at the top with mate 40 pro they're giving you stereo speakers with a real second speaker from a grille at the top and the earpiece and so the stereo effect is better and just in general these speakers get really loud and they're some of the loudest i've heard in a smartphone and they actually sound good so that is technically very impressive oh and while we're talking about what's inside this phone also has a 4400 milliamp hour battery pretty solid flagship size cell and it supports up to 66 watt charging which is insanely fast you might remember i just looked at the oneplus 8t with its 65 watt fast charging so i guess they literally went up that but that whole thing went zero to 100 in under 40 minutes which is crazy and then on top of that it can do 50 watt wireless charging which is incredible now to get that you'll need like the exact right wireless charger that's compatible probably built by huawei and the setup has to be just right but the fact that it's able to achieve that at all is technically impressive then to top off everything inside this phone is powered by their new kirin kiran karen 9000 chip which is actually a five nanometer chipset and so this and apple's a 14 bionic in the new iphones are the first five nanometer chipsets shipping and any smartphones this year so that's of course bleeding edge and all those extra transistors translates generally into performance and efficiency improvements now this isn't the review so i haven't tested battery life and it almost makes me wonder why they didn't just go all out and drop 120 hertz display in this phone if the five nanometer chipset is so impressive and so efficient but nevertheless it's on that bleeding edge it gives you stuff like fusion hdr video with real time processing of every frame and just great overall performance throwing around apps in multitasking and throughout this whole ui and then last bell whistle there is a pretty big pillbox cut out in the top corner of the display which i was a little worried about at first because anytime i see that i'm like all right what did they put up next to the selfie camera like you have this whole huge immersive display with razor thin bezels and you did a pill box cut out but inside this one you get a standard selfie camera and another 100 degree ultra wide so not some like pointless monochrome or depth sensor or anything like that it's actually a significantly wider selfie camera i haven't seen that since the pixel 3 xl but i thought it was great back then and i still think it's great now technically actually you know what that one's not that technically impressive they are still kind of far apart uh it's just smart it's just smart so huawei's mate series each year feels like it's consistently built to just show off the best that they can technically achieve and they have the p series at the beginning of the year which is typically more photography focused and they make a bunch of other phones but it's just another phone they make that is very technically impressive so the story lately has been if this is such a good phone then what are they doing to build up their own experiences to catch up to what they're missing with the lack of google support what are they actually building and you can see it's running emui 11 here not my favorite ui as i've talked about but it doesn't mean there aren't any nice features there are multitasking features and quick launchers and customization and plenty of stuff like that but it's the app situation that's still a sticking point huawei's app gallery continues to grow which is great but it's still missing some pretty fundamental pieces that i would say most people would find needed daily on their phone instagram youtube some of my favorite productivity apps aren't here all of the google apps of course and sometimes i'll actually just list them in the app gallery but as literally web apps so with a link you can see for good measure it's just launching it in the browser now first thing while we would say to that is they're actually making pretty significant improvements to their first party apps so they're alternatives to stuff we're used to so they have their own shopping app they have their own browser they have their own mapping and navigation apps and so that's pretty technically impressive too but to that i would also add my take which is i've always recommended don't buy a piece of of tech based on the promise of future software updates buy it because it's good now and you'd be great with it now if it never got updated and this app store this app gallery and all these services being built they are really great that they're putting in the work and the effort for them but they're not done yet they're not finished being built yet so they'll continue to make incredible phones like this but i'll have to continue waiting until it's achieved that replacement level so while huawei's gotten so good at making technically impressive hardware the end of the video is still the same which is like i wish i could recommend it like imagine take the logo off of this phone take the huawei out of this phone and imagine this phone from someone else the samsungs the apples of the world this would be right up against the bleeding edge of the stuff that they make five nanometer chip super crazy wireless and wired charging tech all this this camera tech in here it's it's really good but i'm not recommending it but all that being said i'm so happy to see the effort because don't think the other companies aren't noticing this stuff either way that's been it thanks for watching a lot more coming soon in tectober stay tuned catch you guys later peace hey guys today we're going to do a review and unboxing of huawei's new smart tv this is the huawei vision s it's a 65 inch 4k 120 hertz smart tv with very vibrant colors and deep blacks with a frame rate upscaling feature called smart memc we're going to find out if it's good for 4k 120hz gaming it also has a number of smart features including a magnetic webcam for conference calls a convenient one-tap mirroring feature that lets you mirror your phone instantly on the screen and many other things like this hey celia turn on tv [Music] just for teaser for the past three months my workspace has been completely running on solar power i'll be posting some diy tutorials soon on my workspace renovation video series let's get to the unboxing based on the instructions from the box open the top first to access the accessory pack at the top left and right sides of the styro you'll find some solid metal feet for the tv at the middle you'll find a box containing the 13 megapixel magnetic webcam we'll be putting the webcam to the test later but as of the moment the webcam looks really premium from the unboxing it has a front glass finish a swivel and a magnetic connector that makes it detachable from the screen inside the accessory bag you'll find some screws for the metal feet you'll also find the rf controller and it comes with some aaa batteries looking closer you'll find the nfc tag for the one tap feature the voice command and navigation buttons and the microphone for the remote's voice command you get an audio video rca to four pin aux adapter and a minimalist power cable you can see where their design team is heading and it looks like they're going for the minimalist approach for their newer products let's get the top styrofoam out of the way and remove the safety latches from beneath after removing the plastic sleeve the tv looks really sleek from the top and up front while having a bit of a hunch at the lower back end of the screen you can find the magnetic connector of the 13 megapixel webcam at the upper rear center of the tv it has two joints and you can reposition the vertical angle of the webcam there's only one button for the tv and it's the power button from beneath technically there are three ways for controlling the tv using the remote your smartphone or the voice command feature at the right side you have a usb port for the smart tv there are also three hdmi 2.1 ports the middle is an hdmi arc and it is compatible with external controls for home theater systems and sound bars they've gotten rid of the av rca port and decided to merge it with a 4 pin aux instead so you have to use the provided adapter for older rca devices aside from the built-in wifi receiver you have an ethernet port and an spdif digital audio connector the power cable is detachable and the connector is at the left side of the tv the speakers look really promising there are four 10 watt speakers in total connected in a two-way tweeter woofer configuration the middle feet looks minimalist by design and seems to be solid and sturdy as well you get the standard vessel mount for 65 inch screens but take note that the brackets are not included [Music] before we mounted the tv on the wall i added some extra rgb strips around the rear panel of the tv a wi-fi rgb alexa compatible controller and velcro the free 4k android tv box my unit came with for the cable management i bought a rectangular pvc conduit for concealing the wires grabbed the trash bin a plank of wood and used my hacksaw to cut it to the length i need i then apply double sided foam tape for mounting it to my wall now insert your cable to the conduit and carefully snap it back in place and ta-dah now i have a man cave the tv features a 4k resolution 120hz lcd panel with 315 nits of brightness there are two variants of the vision s the 65 inch which is the one i got and the smaller and significantly cheaper 55 inch variant in my opinion the 92 percent dci p3 color gamut rating does really seem to check out while it is not an oled display viewing the screen up front tricks your eyes into thinking that it's an ola display the images they're really crisp the colors are punchy and very vibrant though a tad over saturated it's not by much regardless you could always tweak the picture settings up to your preference now let's talk about the color contrast viewing the screen up front you could see how deep the blacks are light does not leak on the darker areas but when you start to view it from the size that's when light starts to leak out the black colored areas which is normal since this thing is an lcd panel and not an oled display but regardless it's not a deal breaker for that 120hz panel i ran a gaming test using my editing rig having an rtx 3070 a ryzen 950 950x processor and 64 gigs of ram as expected even an rtx 3070 would struggle to produce 100 fps on ultra but that's when the memc upscaling feature proves its worth it's a motion estimation algorithm that adds some extra frame so even if you're playing at 60 fps it upscales it to 100 fps making images buttery smooth without artifacts now here's a really neat feature this thing comes with a 13 megapixel magnetic webcam you have me time as the default video conferencing app it's like viber and a smoother version of messenger the feature is really useful for large family gatherings and reconnecting with friends especially in these times of the pandemic here's a quick demo of the webcam you be the judge as for the video i'm shooting with the 13 megapixel on one canvas attached to my television and this is how it looks like here's a quick snapshot okay let's talk about the smart features the remote has a handy nfc chip compatible with huawei android phones one tap with the remote and your phone gets mirrored to the screen mirroring features are nothing new but the novelty nfc implementation was a really smart move for convenience i ran a quick test for latency with a classic game of real racing 3. latency was really low compared to the other tvs we've owned it was extremely responsive which was really impressive [Music] the tv has six microphones in it and it's being used for the voice recognition feature even when it's turned off you can turn her on by saying hey celia turn on tv perfect now you can navigate through the menu the settings and almost everything on harmony os using your voice without using the remote kindly decrease the brightness the brightness is now set at zero percent perfect kindly play some music please all right let's listen to some music and yes you can turn the tv off by using your voice again hey celia screen off the speakers the speakers are really good for a sleek tv here's a quick sound test [Music] dialogues are clear good voice separation and it has punchy bass overall the speakers are good this thing is not an android television the thing runs on harmony os huawei's new operating system for smartphones and smart gadgets harmony feels really light and responsive and the ui implementation is satisfyingly simple as of the moment the os is new making it feel a bit lonely like the earlier years when android was new and had fewer apps at its library and we all know the ongoing trade war so youtube netflix disney plus and prime video aren't on this os nonetheless you can access these apps by connecting the tv to an external android tv box luckily when i got the unit it came with a free 4k android tv box it's a third party android tv box from a french company called strong for a free tv box this thing felt premium and is fully loaded with ports two usb ports external storage ethernet ports hdmi optical well you name it it has everything and yeah you get the standard android tv box rf remote with the google home assistant voice command feature as well an hdmi cable and the power adapter i just velcroed it at the back to make my setup look clean and since i am purely running on solar power i pay very particular attention to how much power my appliances are drawing in my workspace so here's a quick power consumption test the tv draws almost 0 watts in power when it is on hard shut down it takes around 31 seconds for the tv to boot up at this state although you could always use the standby mode and it takes only 1.6 seconds to turn on and only consumes almost zero watts in power hey celia turn on tv in order for you to use the voice recognition feature for turning the tv on and off you'll have to use the screen off mode which draws around 15 watts on standby at 100 brightness it draws around 192 watts at 50 percent brightness around 150 watts at 25 brightness around 115 watts and at the minimum brightness settings around 80 watts in power okay let's wrap up at 49 000 pesos or 1 000 us dollars the tv is a great buy for a 65 inch 4k 120 hertz lcd panel it has really thin bezels has a number of useful smart features and the memc frame rate up scaling feature was deemed to be effective and good for gaming and the audio from the speakers were good as for the cons the tv does not have hdr and harmony os is relatively new and apps have yet to come to their library let's see i hope you guys enjoyed this review thanks for watching the shane stokes once said truth is hard propaganda is cheap keep this in mind as we discussed today the geopolitical and economic impact of canada's detention of the chinese executive mang one zhu my name is dr david wadalu and my name is dr ross stewart and you are watching geopolitics in conflict [Music] [Music] we have now a new membership on patreon uh that in which we provide an in-depth analysis and also some of its perks it's the early release of our videos so if you like our videos and you want to support us consider that membership so back to the topic as we discussed in part one huawei mangwon joe arrested december 1st 2012 and vancouver highly irregular the charge was fraud although she wasn't even informed at that time and we want to do a second part because the issues are so complicated where would you like to go with this david well as we mentioned the two in our first part uh we talked about the economic and today we're gonna be addressing the geopolitical ramifications oh and are there some wow of that detention yes there will be some major geopolitical impact to her detention especially if it gets extradited to the us in august which is happening relatively quickly well exactly this is why the judge judge holmes allowed the defense for them to argue the case as to the evidence and whatever as to where things stand so the judge can make a well-informed decision and i hope the judge realized the ramifications because here is the kicker to all this if she is extradited to the us she's going to be here for a long long time and that's something that i don't believe uh china will stay quiet about and it's going to be some major geopolitical impact today oh yeah it's going to be life and death for some people that's correct so well just we wanted to recap what we talked about in the part one especially when it comes to when it comes down to the economic uh aspects of it and this one has to do with huawei because there's a whole arrest let's take a let's take a just a brief look at huawei sure who's the number one phone producer in the world huawei in terms of the technical infrastructure for all of this technology who's providing cutting edge at the best possible price huawei yeah and so we take a look at agriculture for example in the united states so much of this is now technologically internet driven and you go well who drives the tractors well some of them are automatic and it just goes on and on and on and huawei is leading the pack and so there's severe competition and a number of american companies and european companies are left behind and so the united states government somehow got it in its head that we need to impede huawei's progress any which way we can and they thought well maybe the daughter or the founder who happens to be the cfo maybe we can apply some pressure there get some good leverage points for negotiating with the chinese and it'll be a big help to us well guess what they backfired or how about this roz how about applying pressure by competing by creating some sort of uh centers for technology and so forth where the americans can compete with the chinese wouldn't that be better rather than or cooperate yeah rather than breaking the law because basically what it amounts to her detention is a violation of international law oh if we when we did some legal consulting on this and it is clearly illegal what's going on here i'm still shocked and surprised as to why canada agreed to such violation because it is a clear violation so but today we're going to be focusing on the geopolitical aspects of all this and her detention and why is that important because if as i mentioned earlier if she gets extradited to the u.s you're going to expect china to execute the two michaels and i have the name of those two they call them the two michaels basically because they are uh the first guy is the name by michael spavar and the second one is michael kovrick and the question has always been what are those two michaels we're doing in china in first place yeah so china didn't disclose that information canada didn't disclose that information because that is the norm when it comes down to state secrets both countries that's how they operate so of course for for the china should uh uh madame meng wan zhu got extradited china could move forward with the execution of the two michaels uh would it be espionage or it would be under espionage that's correct so however the china will not disclose the reason why they were detained in first place yes some say it's in retaliation uh to the detention of madame meng one do uh others saying no it's because of the espionage part it won't matter china will not disclose this canada also will not disclose what the two michaels were doing in china in first place it's like what just happened in canada with the high-ranking naval officer who was passing information to the russians oh so canada wasn't going to disclose that first till it became uh known uh following some investigative journalism as to what led to that so that will be one of the impact on on on that well you know what we're seeing with the sanctions what we're seeing with this one joe situation more and more it looks like they're they're we're itching for a fight and the chinese are willing to give it well yeah because they are in possession now they can sort of uh if if and i'm just gonna provide this analogy if i am growing bigger you know okay why would i have to worry about what others are saying when i know my economy is doing great my military is getting bigger my technology is far ahead of any other and even when it comes down to space i am exploring the stars so why would i have to worry about anything and this is where the west is miscalculating the thinking they can bully china you know once again we are not defending china we are not promoting china we are saying what's pragmatic you know and what's pragmatic is when it comes down to this case geopolitically it will have far-reaching consequences because the signal that is going to be sending on the global geopolitical landscape is that countries with much power they can do whatever they want what happened to the sovereignty of other states what happened to the human rights of an individual that's like for example maybe in an american going to china and china arrested me you know i mean for what reason you're right well i'm they're not gonna do that just because i happen to be an american and you have to state the cause for why are you arresting somebody well canada didn't do all this because all this falls under the norm of international law so geopolitically what's going to be happening it's going to strain the change the relations between canada and china of course and it becomes the question of is the west approaching international matters in a way that is contradict contradictory to what international law indicates do you think there are a lot of other countries that are paying attention to this oh there are a lot because here is the thing that just happened and i'll share it we'll share it with you of course i don't know whether you are aware of the rain air airplane that was uh forced to land in minx immense airport in in in belarus okay and all of a sudden the west is going forensic about the abuses of the government for landing the plane and human rights violations and all that stuff what happened in 2013 when the plane that was carrying the president of bolivia morales was forced to land in switzerland because they were thinking that edward snowden was on that plane [Laughter] you didn't here to think about it right so this is where the double standards and just to go back to canada if we are to see a behavior from a canada like this there is right now a video circling about a polish priest who's been detained in canada for 30 hours because he spoke against the government didn't agree with the government since when canada started to detain people for voicing their opinions and this is where my concern and that was a big scandal it was all over the internet it was it was it was shame on canada to behave that way because they are tarnishing their image and as we mentioned in our first part because the elections are coming so you can just see it will become now on the canadians to decide what type of government they want it's not our place to say and you can count on the fact that canadians are having the kind of conversation says well are we really subservient to the united states if they want something illegally done we'll just go ahead and do it well it looks like they are because that's what the government is right so you take this and you apply it to the geopolitical landscape you know so now what do you think countries in the middle east will be thinking what do you think countries in africa will be thinking so if canada that is supposed to be the hallmark of respect of the law and so forth behaving that way then we shouldn't be blaming country a for acting whatever we shouldn't be blaming country b for behaving that way so and that becomes the question of where do you draw the line as far as the human rights of individuals and the sovereignty of the state so those are the key aspects that i foresee the ramifications of uh madame meng one zoo if she gets extra lighted to the us is there some bottom line takeaway in addition to what you just said that you think would that you think would be helpful for our viewers well the bottom line uh for you to understand is that the detention of this chinese executive goes beyond just arresting somebody right this is when you realize that the arrest of an individual as an executive will have an international ramifications and with this case we're gonna see that should the judge decide in august to allow the extradition of madame wenju to the u.s so that's the bottom line which means for you as an american don't be shocked or surprised if you ever go to country a and you end up being arrested because that's the way it's going to become so let us know your thoughts in the comments also be sure to check out our other videos don't forget to like share and subscribe thanks for watching and as always stay informed till next time bye [Music] with the prices of gpus going up and the shortages that is happening in the market right now it's a really bad time to build a pc or to even own one but that's probably not the case with huawei who has just ventured into the pc world by making their very first desktop available in the malaysia market yes folks we got the huawei mate station s here which is actually a pretty decent setup in my opinion because you get a monitor and the cpu itself for 3 000 ringgit which i think is pretty worth it because even if i were to build my own pc it actually comes up to around the same price or probably slightly more expensive depending on the components that you choose and you know what they even give this little gift box over here when i pre-ordered the device and i'm pretty excited to see what huawei has to offer on its first desktop because it is a really good deal that they are offering right here and speaking of good news why not visit our store at google deals by klg you could actually get 20 ringgit of your first order when you sign up as a new customer so visit our store in the link in the description down below so first let's start off by unboxing the box on the right which is on my left by the way so this is the cpu unit of the huawei mate station s so we are going to just cut open the seal it's been a while since i did some unboxing so yeah takes a little bit of practice here all right let's take out the first box here let's take a look all right so we have a wired mouse by huawei and we have the power cord and we finally get the unit here wow it's actually pretty compact case we have right here alright so here you go actually you know what it's actually smaller than what i expected i thought it would be slightly thicker and taller this is actually pretty compact and as you can see there's this star trail design that huawei has made on the mix station as to differentiate from its business desktop lineups yup they do actually sell business desktops back in china but not here this is their very first unit so just gonna cut open the seal as well all right and we're gonna open up this box it's pretty huge because it's a 23.8 inch monitor right let's check out the first layer all right we got an hdmi cable and we have the power adapter here which actually looks like a smartphone break apart from the fact that it doesn't have a usb port yep that's a three pin prong right over there and a barrel plug and we have more stuff and yes the keyboard is included with the monitor wait is it no that's actually a monitor but yeah i'm getting a monitor stand okay so this is the monitor it's pretty big we have the monitor stand yep the arm not stand the arm and finally there's no keyboard where is the keyboard i already do see where the keyboard really is where is the key oh wow i found it all right that's i'm a pretty bad unboxer but there you go the keyboard is actually included with the unit it's just in this box that i did not expect to see this alright so yeah here is the keyboard of the huawei mate station desk the reason why i am most intrigued with this because the keyboard is actually one of the few desktop pcs to come with a built-in fingerprint reader and you can also kind of like tap your huawei smartphone at the share area here to share your smartphone screen or transfer file from your huawei smartphone okay this is it it actually looks pretty nice though and it looks very much like the microsoft designer keyboard the keys pretty nice to tap on there are uh scissor cut switches um pretty good way better than the macbook pros uh keyboard i'm gonna enjoy typing this a lot so before we get this all set up let's talk a little bit about this mini desktop here so as i mentioned earlier on the front you get this really nice serious looking star trail design that looks good on any desk this is a pretty compact chassis and on the front here you get a full-size usb 3.1 port and the usb c port when i check on huawei's side it says that this is a usb 2.0 c4 which you know i can't bring it why do they actually provide a usb 2.0 c port instead of putting that on the full size one but anyway there is a power button right over here as well as well as an auto jack for headphones which is great so turning the unit to the back reveals a standard set of ports you will find on your desktop pcs as well so you get the usual three color coded audio jacks and you get an hdmi port a vga port um two usb 3s i guess it says here it says usb 3.2 and the bottom row here is the usb 2.0 port you get an ethernet port and finally who else uses a serial port these days nobody uses that i mean wow this is a really legacy board i haven't seen for years on pcs already right and finally here's the power part we should insert your power cord all right so one thing i like about this chassis here is that it is too less if you want to access the internals so let's take out the screw just like this this is a little tough let me just get my screwdriver okay got my screwdriver and i'm just gonna insert it in and unscrew this thing here so it's not exactly too less if you are taking apart for the first time and finally there is a warranty sticker here that you will need to cut apart in order to access to the internals even though it didn't say that it will void the warranty if you rip the sticker but it says that you need to read the warranty policy carefully before removing so best to do that before do anything inside otherwise it could possibly void the warranty if you do something to the internals all right let's just open oh easy it goes and we're just going to pull this cap here and open simple as that open already let's take a look inside the internals of the mate station s so what we are seeing here is an itx form factor motherboard and with very limited expansion options this is kind of expected for desktop oem motherboards like this but fortunately we still get some expansion options right over here so you get a sata connector here if you want to expand storage with a satellite ssd or hard drive but unfortunately there's nowhere around the chassis that you can mount a drive which i have no idea why they offer that but you know it's good just in case if you want to switch to a bigger casing so you get a pci ssd slot over here which is actually great and the recommended way of expanding storage on this device here so the huawei mate station s uses a western digital ss 730 nvme ssd 256 gigabytes of storage which is good enough for most people out there and you get a pcie x16 slot here if you intend to upgrade graphics but unfortunately i don't think it fits any of the powerful gpus out there because first of all the power supply of this pc here is only rated at 300 watts so unless you want slightly better graphics than the integrated cpu graphics otherwise you really don't get to expand it with a gpu here because also this casing is not really tall as well so chances are if you really manage to slot in a gpu you will have to do without this casing here all right and finally we see two sodium slots here one is already used up this is an eight gigabyte hynix uh ddr4 3200 megahertz ramp which is a good speed for modern pcs and finally let's talk about this thing here this is the a custom cpu fan made for the mixtation asus amd ryzen 5 4600g cpu so this unit here already comes with a integrated graphics it's a radeon graphics which is actually good enough for basic graphic stuff or like such as graphic design and video editing and it can actually do a little bit of lightweight gaming based on my knowledge which we are going to find out if it actually works later so that's pretty much about the midstation assets internals let's put it back on and we are going to set up the monitor next so unlike some chinese monitors that i've come across far away's monitor is really really easy to set up so all you need to do is to take out this arm gear firstly mount the arm on the back of the monitor so that it clips on it it's a clip system which is actually very user friendly so by the way this monitor has a hdmi and vga input which is actually pretty standard i'm not going to expect much from a 24 inch full hd monitor it doesn't have any audio output as well so yeah no audio from this monitor as well and all you need to do next is to mount onto this base here so you just basically slot it in just put it down slot it in and finally at the bottom here you do have to do something which is to screw the base there is a built-in screw at the bottom really and you just need to just like twist it and secure it and there you have it the monitor is ready to go so you do get this civil angle which is actually pretty good if you want to view it in different angles and now that we are all set let's fire up the huawei mate station s okay so i've basically set up the mate station as the setup is pretty straightforward no complicated instructions just follow through the typical windows setup with cortana make sure you mute it and you're all set this is how the desktop is so what i'm really happy about the may station is is that it doesn't come preloaded with some bloatware that some oems would usually do on their desktop so what you only get out of the mate station as a software suite is just the pc manager and user guide so the pc manager is huawei's very own software that is used for updating drivers bios and even connect your huawei smartphone over to your mixstation s which is actually a pretty great tool if you own a huawei device all right so um there's nothing much to talk about over here because it really doesn't come with any additional features that i can actually talk about but one thing that i really like about the mate station s is really the keyboard like i mentioned earlier the keyboard has a fingerprint reader that signs into windows but what it also does is it also acts as a power button for makestation s so whatever if you want to turn on a pc you don't need to press on the power button on the cpu button state just tap on this fingerprint button over here and it turns on the midstation s so can the main station s be a capable compact budget gaming and creative machine to find out i upgraded the system ram to 16 gigabytes by adding a second eight gigabyte stick to ensure a more reliable and consistent testing experience this is recommended even if you are thinking to use it for productivity purposes and doesn't cost a lot to do so with 512 megabytes of dedicated memory and 8 gigabytes of shared memory you are going to need to compromise graphics quality and run games at 720p in order to get playable frame rates well it's not exactly 60 frames per second but at least most games we benchmark hit more than 40 frames per second on average you probably wouldn't invest in a system like this to play games like cyberpunk 2077 or pubg and grunder the main station s isn't made to be a gaming system but benchmarking these games gives us an idea how far the ryzen 4 600g integrator graphics can go in creative applications the main station s was able to scrap through a simple 4k video project on premium pro with elemetric color effects applied of course don't expect to do complex video projects on it as it can start while doing so you also need to be a little patient with export times due to lesser stream processes on the integrated gpu otherwise you shouldn't have problems doing vectors and illustration work on the system if you have sufficient amount of ram installed what i'm very impressed is how cool and silent the mate station s is even when it is on full load the blower type cooler never makes a noise like how amd stock colors do and is able to maintain a temperature of 45 degrees celsius on idle and hits a maximum 85 degrees celsius on full load the huawei mate station has retails at 24.99 ringgit whereas if you were to include the monitor into the package that will cost you an extra 500 or 600 ringgit depending on whether you got it at the pre-order stage so is this a good deal or is this worth buying as a personal pc instead of going to the pc shops and customizing your own pc well it really depends on what you're looking at if you want a no fuels desktop as in you don't need all those like expansion features you just want a basic good performing pc the huawei mate station s definitely delivers that and on top of that if you use the huawei phone yeah enjoy that brilliant ecosystem that you can use it to transfer files or to share your phone screen across your desktop because only this can deliver that but otherwise if you ask me as a pc enthusiast well i would definitely think twice if i want to get this as my personal pc because personally i like to do a lot of mods like i want to do some expansion and all this and as you can see just now the internals are actually really limited so this kind of desktop pcs are really not meant for the diy enthusiast if you're thinking to expand your pc with gpus or more storage devices this is just a really good basic good performing pc and the good thing is that it comes with an amd ryzen 5 4 600 g processor with integrated graphics so that you do not need to spend a bomb on graphics cards right now if you want to do some lightweight gaming so that's pretty much about my thoughts about the huawei mate station s do leave me any comments down below if you have any questions about this pc and be sure to subscribe to our channel for more

all new modern huawei and honor smartphones and tablets aren't equipped with google services out of the box due to china u.s trade situation and because of this huawei users in need of google apps are either using web apps browser shortcuts and other methods to access google on their phones fortunately there is a solution that allows emi 11 users to access google services with the use of an app called gspace gspace is a sandbox-like virtual machine app with a google play store inside this will allow you to install and run google apps and other apps on your huawei or on your device but there is also a one downside gspace doesn't allow you to have a google play shortcut on your favorite home screen every time you want to download some apps you have to tap on the gspace folder then tap on an application and then tap on the back button it is annoying but i have a hack for you it works great and allows you to have a google play shortcut on your favorite home screen so let's get started

download is complete now go back open files internal storage download and this is the file tap on it here you have to choose more and extract and select choose current directory tap on ok ok open the folder and now tap on g space right here weapon allow allow no risk detected tap on install tap on open before you tap on start go back settings this is a important step apps apps search for space

appreciate your support bros thank you peace [Applause] [Applause] you Huawei's just launched this this is their latest 
flagship tablet called the MatePad Pro we have   a 12.6 inch screen with this one now it's oled 
it's all powered by the kirin 9000 now my unit   here that was sent out to me from huawei has 8 
gigabytes of ram and 256 gigabytes of storage   the battery capacity in this one is a large 10 
050 milliamp hours it does have wireless charging,   40 watt charging and the optional keyboard 
you can see which i do have i'll be covering   that in this review and the m pencil active 
stylus inside the box of the mate pad pro   you will find a 40 watt supercharger we have an 
adapter here for 3.5 millimeter to type c and   a sim tray tool now my model doesn't have the 
sim support but other models i believe will   and this does have expandable storage option 
which you need this tool here of course to   access this tablet for a 12.6 inch one has a 
very good weight to it so it is only just over   600 grams as you see here with my scales 616 very 
very thin too as well so just a fraction under   seven millimeters according to my measurements 
and take a look at the size of the bezels of   this one they're only about five millimeters there 
very very slim bezels around the 12.6 inch screen   up the top of the mate pad pro here we have a 
volume up and down button and the frame around it   is made out of plastic also the material on 
the back so three microphones here along the   top down the bottom we have the expandable storage 
little tray there which would also be a sim tool   if you do get a version that does have lte or 5g 
i believe possible future editions of those may be   coming but at this time it's just for storage at 
the moment it takes huawei's in m card on the left   are power button some harman kardon speakers 
so they are side firing either side of this   on the right we've got a type c port and you can 
see the other speakers right there so this type   c port supports video out i've tested it out 
with a type c to hdmi and also a huawei type   c dock works just fine but it's only cloning the 
display there doesn't seem to be any desktop mode   this time with it the material on the back this 
is made out of a high quality plastic just like   the frame and it does not feel cheap at all it's 
quite a premium feel to this particular tablet   and a small camera module here so there are three 
cameras our main camera is 13 megapixels we have   an 8 megapixel ultra wide and then the camera 
that is used for time of flight for our 3d depth   sensing you can see it is branded right there 
and this is our fourth microphone on the back and   there is an led flash going is the cutout in the 
screen now too so we used to have the front facing   camera right here which was a cut out in the 
screen they've moved it right here the 8 megapixel   front facing camera to the top bezel and i do 
prefer this now it supports face unlocking which   is very quick and i haven't had any issues with 
it it is reliable and seems to be quite accurate   you can also get this is a optional keyboard for 
it so it's a keyboard type cover and it covers   the rear of it so magnets hold this into place 
it has this texture on the back of it which is   soft it's a synthetic material it's all like 
a plastic they are using but it's high quality   and the magnets are very strong holding this 
into place and the other side is exactly the   same they're covering that up so to open it 
up simply lift it down and then we've got   these two different positions so that's the 
most upright position there for the tablet   and then the next one down is the one i like to 
use it's more of a comfortable angle i find when   i'm sitting at a desk which is good and typing on 
this particular keyboard very comfortable it's so   much better than using an on-screen keyboard so 
if you do type a lot i do recommend getting these   i'd say that with all other tablets that support 
the hardware keyboards because it's superior to   on-screen keyboard typing and good spacing of the 
keys we've got most of the shortcuts and things   you would want on here there's a cut you can see 
with that button we've got the function keys there   too as well and overall it is good it has around 
about 1.4 millimeters to 1.3 millimeters of travel   so a little short on the travel with the keys it 
does lie completely flat so you can't prop it up   to a more comfortable typing angle so very similar 
to what we've seen with other manufacturers when   it comes to their type covers that they lay 
flat there it is not backlit and it is powered   by the tablet itself overall it's a quality 
keyboard i like this one so the screen here it   does have a resolution of 2560x1600 we've got 
various different options with our color you   can change the white balance you can tweak it to 
your own preference there vivid's on by default i   do actually prefer normal and there's one option 
here i really do like which is natural tone that   automatically adjusts the color temperature based 
on your ambient lighting i find it actually does   work very well now the maximum brightness of this 
particular screen here is close to 700 nets it's   very good it's fully laminated it has scratch 
resistant glass over it and yes it is an oled   but it has a pen to arrangement so if you look 
at it really really close around the fonts you   will notice sometimes around the letters that it 
does have jagged edges now to me this is not an   issue it's like the lenovo p11 pro that i reviewed 
if you look at it really close it will not look as   sharp as other panels yes but at normal viewing 
distances i don't actually personally find this   to be an issue it's a sharp and good looking 
screen now back there in the options under display   we've got our dark mode ebook mode is there too 
you can adjust the screen size so if you're not   happy with it looking a little bit large like that 
i would probably actually run it really small but   for this review i'm keeping it on default you 
can increase that too as well so your typical   scaling options they're all there with 
the harmony os that this is running   and one last thing with our screen that the 
touch response is very very good no problems   and i'm not seeing any flicker with it so we've 
swapped now from emui to harmony os which is the   new thing here from huawei and they have made 
some design changes especially with this tablet   with the ui so you can see if i swipe down here 
from the right we have the control center so all   of our toggles right there we've even got music 
connected devices and our brightness controls   very easy to access everything right there doc 
here at the bottom we have the last three apps   that i have run so recent apps are there and 
notifications if you just swipe down here from   the top so you can see that it's stating there 
non-commercial version that's because this is   not a commercial version okay this is not a retail 
unit i don't have retail firmware it is a loan   device from huawei that is why that's there so 
it's not a final version of the software but   i have not experienced any bugs or issues so far 
with it which is great when you take a look at our   settings it's all standard pretty much laid out as 
it was before with emui it's very very similar and   familiar to us everything's there so my version 
here has the eight gigabytes of ram 256 gigabytes   of storage and i've updated everything i can hms 
core that is there that was updated and you can   see here the version that i have which is version 
2.00122 at the time of this video is the most   recent there so with our applications i'll just 
go into a couple of things here to point out that   uh when you're going to run something and if you 
want to run it in a window you can do that okay so   absolute support it you'll see this little icon 
here so you can run windowed apps you can swap   over and do multitasking this way which is very 
quick to just bring things up so i can bring up   browser here okay so it'll pop up into there and 
the whole thing has been performing just so fast   smooth and fluid which is good is what i want 
to see out of my tablet but i really do miss   at least having like 90 hertz would have 
been the the sweet spot there to have that   for the performance at least so we've got app 
gallery of course now with app gallery i'll   just minimize those and get them out of the 
way it's improving because you've got pedal   search now so a lot of the applications that 
we couldn't get before they are now finally   there more developers are moving over and and 
getting their apps onto their market which is good   even though it doesn't have everything some 
games especially are lacking they're not there   it will come up with alternatives where you can 
install things so i tried to run display tester   which i likes one of my applications so you will 
occasionally run into that problem so here when   i just bring it up you see display tester it 
still wants play services unfortunately that   one is not going to work but i found workarounds 
for a lot of things now i do not approve of this   application and i know so many people run 
it because i see it in comments all the time   as youtube advanced of course now if you did 
want youtube you could install that but please   if you're using an android device that does 
support normal youtube use that please there's   adverts support the creators out there because 
this removes all ads and i'm highly against it   but i know i'm not stupid people out there 
are using this app so it's there if you needed   youtube or you can use the browser now for gmail 
and things like that you can use email and you   can access your gmail so there are workarounds 
for a lot of things and it is slowly getting   better it's just that some apps won't work 
yet on this particular tablet and harmony os   now for benchmarks a little bit skinned 
unfortunately because i could not get antutu to   run on this tablet not yet hopefully support for 
that one will be added later on in the future so   here we have wildlife that's a 3d mark benchmark 
and it gets a very respectable score here that   does tell us what we already know that it is yes 
a flagship and it has flagship performance there   and look at these storage speeds they are just so 
so quick sequential reads of over 2 000 rights of   over 1500 there and look at those random reads 
and writes this fast fast fast storage is not   going to hold up this tablet at all it's just 
so quick over to audio now so impressive sound   out of the side firing speakers that this one has 
from harman kardon they are truly right up there   i would say with some of the best i've heard from 
a tablet good volume but it does not distort it's   clear it's quite balanced there's a bit of bass 
in there so just before i give you that sample   i wanted to point out that yes you can use 3.5 
millimeter audio with this but there's no jack   okay so you have to use that included adapter 
now sound through it it sounds fine to my ears   it does sound really good bluetooth audio as 
well i have tested that out on it and no issues   it also sounds excellent here are those speakers 
now at 100 volume it really is quite impressive and what about just media consumption on this 
very very good because it's got a really nice   oled screen super deep blacks great contrast very 
good colors on it now it does have widevine level   1 suit however i have noticed with netflix at 
least i think amazon prime video is is in 1080p   but barbarians is a series i will just look at 
right now it's very good actually it's subbed   over but i would watch it in german with subtitles 
this one very very good however running it and   letting it just go when you look at it closely it 
doesn't seem to me it's definitely not in full hd   it seems like it's running at just hd or standard 
definition even though we've got the widevine   level one cert netflix just doesn't want to run 
it at full hd and having a look at youtube here   with my one of my own videos just bring it up into 
full screen and you can run this right up to 4k   with no problems and it does look very sharp and 
great as you can see looking on this that there's   no problems but again because it's a 16 by 10 
aspect ratio screen and this content most media   or videos at least movies and things will be 16 
by nine so that's why we have the borders there   top and bottom we do have now support for the m 
pencil which is optional is not included so very   similar to the last gen one but it does have a 
lot of improvements now it's faster more accurate   and you can see here that i can place it onto the 
top so this does charge wirelessly you can see m   pencil 100 battery and the battery just seems to 
go forever on this it does last a very very long   time and most people will be storing it on the top 
and it'll be fully charged anyway when you need it   now the magnet is very very strong it holds it 
in place then if i violently shake the tablet   you can see that's that's not going 
anywhere so i do like how strong it is   now it does have palm rejection of course which we 
need with a stylus like this a very a smart stylus   now the detection works approximately i would 
say about five four millimeters away from the   screens you can see that when i do it now 
okay i've got finger support oh that's i'm   on the eraser mode that's why so there we go it's 
going to work then but as soon as it's about here   or touching the screen that's the palm rejection 
so only then the pencil is going to work now it   has 496 pressure levels this is me just pressing 
very very light you can hardly see that and i   press harder and then harder and harder and you 
can see that's coming through now it does work   right up to the absolute very edges here 
so drawing straight lines across the screen   doesn't seem to be a problem at all it does 
seem very very quick and accurate now this   is autodesk sketch that i'm using right here with 
this one so it's one app that does work with this   and you've got your various different tools 
too so i do find the performance of this pen   the updated pin seems to be very very quick and 
for handwriting i'll just give you a short demo   now this app i'm using is called nebu or nebo it 
did come with the tablet so see how it appears   here with handwriting okay that didn't even 
work for some reason no because i haven't even the sap is called nebu or nebo it did come with 
the tablet and let's see how it fares here so   hello world oops how uh you very messy my writing there but it 
seems to work quite well i'll just do another very   quick one-handed test there and i do it again with 
my palm of course so i think for note takers out   there this one is quite good it's very fast and 
i do like that latency that i'm seeing with it   and accuracy where i'm putting the nib of it it's 
pretty much exactly where it is coming through on   the screen now you can write into any area that 
there is text important i'll quickly show you   that so if i just tap there and i can just write 
now hello you'll see it'll recognize that and that   is converted over so any area that you want to 
for example you're filling in a form online on a   website you can simply instead of typing with the 
keyboard or the on-screen keyboard you can simply   just go ahead and write that into those text 
fields now gaming performance is excellent thanks   to that kirin 9000 the eight gigabytes of ram so 
with pubg yes it can run pubg no problems call of   duty i did try to run that one and i just couldn't 
get it to run it does want google play services   unfortunately for that title but very very smooth 
performance right here at the 60 frames per second   if i look down the sights i've already got three 
kills very smooth no lag and so immersive thanks   to this large screen and then those speakers the 
speakers sound absolutely fantastic on this tablet   especially for gaming it really does add to the 
immersion so to get the 60 frames per second   option you simply just need to set the graphics 
with pubg to smooth if you put it on balanced   then we only get the ultra frame rate which is 
45 frames per second and i want the extreme here   which is of course 60. now over to our camera so 
the front facing camera we have with this tablet   is eight megapixels it can shoot a maximum of 
1080p resolution the quality is okay it looks   a little bit soft to me but it is certainly better 
than my laptop's webcam so if you're gonna be   using this for say skype or zoom calls and things 
it's adequate and there of course are the four   microphones in total that this MatePad Pro has and 
the 13 megapixel camera on the rear this one can   shoot up to 4k with electronic image stabilization 
for a tablet the quality is acceptable   it's all right i mean i have seen better and your 
phone will probably do a lot better than this   but at least we do have this option 
for 4k video with the stabilization   and then we can shoot with the ultra wide too it's 
very windy here at the moment so we have a bit of   wind noise coming through 
on those mics as expected   and just a few short photos from the rear camera 
so the main 13 megapixel and a shot from the 8   megapixel ultra wide again i think for a tablet 
the camera quality is definitely acceptable and   it's better than others i've seen it's not maybe 
the best but it is usable and that's what we want   okay so this tablet has some fantastic hardware 
the kirin 9000 the eight gigabytes of ram and   that really quick storage fastest storage i have 
seen in the tablet i mean look at those sequential   reads and rights they are excellent so good gaming 
performance is great and then the speakers on this   the speaker setup has to be probably one of the 
best i have heard in a tablet very immersive for   gaming and of course playing pub g there with the 
gunfire the footsteps and on this large screen was   a very immersive enjoyable experience stylus so 
this m pencil improved it's better it's faster   i like the fact that we can just write in anywhere 
there's a text input if you wanted to do that with   your handwriting and handwriting recognition 
seems to be working quite well even for   my messy handwriting so other things about this 
the screen i think is where they've made a bit   of a blunder here 60 hertz take a look at your 
competitors and everyone else now is swapping over   to say 90 or 120 hertz displays and i believe 
with this resolution 90 would have been perfect   the blender course of battery life and a fluid 
smooth ui not to say it's not fluid for 60 hertz   it is very good the performance it feels fluid the 
animations look good recent apps multitasking is   good another thing too with the display out that 
it just seems to at the moment mirror what is on   the screen okay so it's just using a casting and 
it's just the wired casting mode wide mirror mode   now and it seems at the time of doing this video 
there doesn't seem to be a desktop mode there for   as well so battery life is very good so over a 10 
000 milliamp hour battery it will just go and go   and i'm getting around 10 possibly 11 hours out 
of this and that's with netflix browser general   kind of light mixed use it just goes and goes i 
have found that those seven nanometer carrying   9000 chips they are very efficient and it tends to 
work quite well so the other thing is okay harmony   os is now new we've got uh the app gallery which 
is getting better but still not everything's there   so be prepared to find workaround or different 
apps that do the same thing if you're going   to be getting one of these you have to find 
solutions and you have to find okay well gmail   you can use the mail app for google maps okay 
you need your mapping map app then you've got   pixel maps on there so far doesn't actually seem 
to be too bad at all i've been testing it out   now gps accuracy seems fine on this seems very 
good not a problem with it there and it's just   that you're not going to find every single app 
that you want and i know that puts off a few   other people but it is getting better and i'm 
seeing the improvements coming through which is   great i just hope more developers get on board the 
area where i find that it falls short with those   apps and games that you can't find is that games 
more okay so say call of duty not working on   this it's mostly the games which i've had more 
difficulty with with this particular tablet here   so excellent hardware great build got a lot going 
for it i just want to see that app gallery mature   more so thank you so much for watching my review

tags like tracker but instead of using bluetooth this one instead of using bluetooth this one actually has an active t-mobile lde actually has an active t-mobile lde sim connection so it can broadcast its sim connection so it can broadcast its location from almost anywhere in the location from almost anywhere in the world world with apple and samsung getting serious with apple and samsung getting serious about these trackers and oppo and others about these trackers and oppo and others being rumored to launch their versions being rumored to launch their versions too expect pretty much every tech too expect pretty much every tech company in the world to try their luck company in the world to try their luck with this form factor in the next few with this form factor in the next few months months we have just added trackers as our we have just added trackers as our latest category in crowd so new releases latest category in crowd so new releases will show up in our release monitor will show up in our release monitor together with more than 30 new products together with more than 30 new products that we add every week that we add every week pretty much as soon as they come out so pretty much as soon as they come out so check it out and upload your favorite check it out and upload your favorite releases there releases there in the last highlighted release this in the last highlighted release this week will be all of the new laptops week will be all of the new laptops announced at samsung's announced at samsung's unpacked event on wednesday now i don't unpacked event on wednesday now i don't typically cover typically cover random laptops on my channel but i do random laptops on my channel but i do think that there is an interesting story think that there is an interesting story to unpack with these ones in particular to unpack with these ones in particular so the three intel powered models have so the three intel powered models have officially been

for a while now that's making pcs for a while now that's nothing new but they've always kind of nothing new but they've always kind of treated them like a side project like treated them like a side project like you know you know by the way we make pcs as well however by the way we make pcs as well however it looks like with these computers the it looks like with these computers the company is about to take them much more company is about to take them much more seriously seriously first just the messaging around the first just the messaging around the laptops this year was on a whole new laptops this year was on a whole new scale scale it's the first time samsung gave laptops it's the first time samsung gave laptops their own dedicated unpacked event their own dedicated unpacked event on the same level as their phones on the same level as their phones usually get even with appearances from usually get even with appearances from panos panet the head of windows consumer panos panet the head of windows consumer as well as a bunch of people from intel as well as a bunch of people from intel etc and second samsung has started to etc and second samsung has started to position these laptops as not just position these laptops as not just yet another group of windows laptops but yet another group of windows laptops but as a part of the greater samsung as a part of the greater samsung ecosystem the new laptops come with ecosystem the new laptops come with share which is basically samsung's share which is basically samsung's version of airdrop that works between version of airdrop that works between the computer the computer and phones second screen should allow and phones second screen should allow laptop owners to use their samsung laptop owners to use their samsung tablets as a sort of second monitor much tablets as a sort of second monitor much like apple users can use their ipads via like apple users can use their ipads via sidecar sidecar there is a built-in smartthings app on there is a built-in smartthings app on the pcs to control the pcs to control internet of things devices there is internet of things devices there is quick pairing for samsung accessories quick pairing for samsung accessories like earbuds for example and the like earbuds for example and the computers come pre-installed with apps computers come pre-installed with apps like samsung gallery and like samsung gallery and nodes which as you would expect will nodes which as you would expect will sync relevant apps between your phone sync relevant apps between your phone and your pc and your pc now most of these ecosystem things now most of these ecosystem things they're basically just apps that could they're basically just apps that could theoretically run on any windows pc and theoretically run on any windows pc and it is unclear whether samsung will keep it is unclear whether samsung will keep them as exclusives to their them as exclusives to their pcs or not but i think the direction pcs or not but i think the direction that they're taking that they're taking is pretty clear samsung is trying to is pretty clear samsung is trying to make it so that their laptops are deeply make it so that their laptops are deeply integrated with the rest of their integrated with the rest of their ecosystem ecosystem i think huawei was the only company that i think huawei was the only company that maybe pulled this off even remotely maybe pulled this off even remotely successfully so far so we'll have to see successfully so far so we'll have to see if samsung's implementation ends up if samsung's implementation ends up being anything more than just being anything more than just annoying bloatware but it makes sense annoying bloatware but it makes sense for the company to at least for the company to at least try to stand out from the incredibly try to stand out from the incredibly competitive android and windows markets competitive android and windows markets okay and while we are at huawei my okay and while we are at huawei my second story of the week will be the second story of the week will be the company's phone company's phone business having a particularly business having a particularly challenging quarter challenging quarter revenue growth for the company as a revenue growth for the company as a whole has basically come to a halt and whole has basically come to a halt and their profits were slightly down their profits were slightly down so overall huawei was basically flat but so overall huawei was basically flat but their phone business in particular has their phone business in particular has basically collapsed basically collapsed remember how just a year and a half ago remember how just a year and a half ago huawei hit the number one spot for a huawei hit the number one spot for a brief moment brief moment in the world well last quarter they in the world well last quarter they didn't even make it to the top didn't even make it to the top five at all falling behind even xiaomi five at all falling behind even xiaomi oppo and vivo for the first time oppo and vivo for the first time in europe their market share shrank to in europe their market share shrank to just two percent when not long ago they just two percent when not long ago they were on track to become market leaders were on track to become market leaders and even in its home market of china the and even in its home market of china the company's share collapsed from almost 40 company's share collapsed from almost 40 to just under 15 putting it into third to just under 15 putting it into third place place now well below both oppo and vivo and now well below both oppo and vivo and about to be overtaken by both xiaomi and about to be overtaken by both xiaomi and apple it is quite incredible just how apple it is quite incredible just how long they were able to keep their long they were able to keep their business going but now that the company business going but now that the company has basically run out of high-end chips has basically run out of high-end chips it has stockpiled before it has stockpiled before the us government ban came into effect the us government ban came into effect it seems like the good days are finally it seems like the good days are finally over over this collapse is particularly this collapse is particularly challenging because basically as soon as challenging because basically as soon as sales drop their flywheel stops turning sales drop their flywheel stops turning and that suddenly means that app and that suddenly means that app developers are not incentivized to bring developers are not incentivized to bring their apps their apps to the huawei app gallery and that to the huawei app gallery and that creates a negative cycle that can't creates a negative cycle that can't really be recovered from really be recovered from unless the bands get lifted of course in unless the bands get lifted of course in the meanwhile the company is frantically the meanwhile the company is frantically trying to switch to other areas trying to switch to other areas including software and cars where they including software and cars where they would be unaffected by the ban at least would be unaffected by the ban at least in theory but it looks like the phone in theory but it looks like the phone business is basically done for and i business is basically done for and i would actually argue that they should would actually argue that they should probably spin it off as an independent probably spin it off as an independent company much like they have done with company much like they have done with honor so at least honor so at least they could try to save themselves okay they could try to save themselves okay and my third story of the week will be and my third story of the week will be that pretty much that pretty much all tech companies that aren't called all tech companies that aren't called huawei had incredible earnings huawei had incredible earnings last quarter apple microsoft google last quarter apple microsoft google amazon facebook samsung lg qualcomm amazon facebook samsung lg qualcomm amd sony tesla ebay shopify pretty much amd sony tesla ebay shopify pretty much all tech companies universally had all tech companies universally had record revenue and profit figures record revenue and profit figures basically across the board with only basically across the board with only huawei and intel huawei and intel seeing flat tube slightly declining seeing flat tube slightly declining results results and not only did individual companies do and not only did individual companies do particularly well what is amazing is particularly well what is amazing is that pretty much that pretty much every segment and every product category every segment and every product category did amazingly as well did amazingly as well every major filmmaker had a fantastic every major filmmaker had a fantastic quarter except for huawei of course quarter except for huawei of course pc sales are still way higher than they pc sales are still way higher than they were before the pandemic the gaming were before the pandemic the gaming industry is at an all-time industry is at an all-time high with the playstation 5 for example high with the playstation 5 for example outperforming even the historically outperforming even the historically successful playstation 4 despite the successful playstation 4 despite the chip shortages chip shortages and the switch continuing to do and the switch continuing to do incredibly well two incredibly well two home electronics have had yet another home electronics have had yet another very strong quarter very strong quarter especially for companies like lg especially for companies like lg internet advertising which saw a big internet advertising which saw a big crash at the beginning of the pandemic crash at the beginning of the pandemic is back to booming with facebook google is back to booming with facebook google microsoft's linkedin and more seeing microsoft's linkedin and more seeing record revenues e-commerce is of course record revenues e-commerce is of course at an all-time high too at an all-time high too with for example amazon seeing over 200 with for example amazon seeing over 200 million million prime customers business software and prime customers business software and services for companies like microsoft services for companies like microsoft continue to do continue to do extremely well and the list just goes on extremely well and the list just goes on and not only that but most of the tech and not only that but most of the tech companies are basically saying that this companies are basically saying that this pandemic has lasted long enough for pandemic has lasted long enough for consumers to actually consumers to actually get used to their new habits and so they get used to their new habits and so they expect that even once the pandemic is expect that even once the pandemic is over over many of these habits are here to stay many of these habits are here to stay and many of the tech companies will and many of the tech companies will continue continue to shower in money more and more in the to shower in money more and more in the future future in fact the giants have so much money in fact the giants have so much money now that they often just don't really now that they often just don't really know where to put it which is why many know where to put it which is why many of them are doing record of them are doing record stock buybacks or in other words using stock buybacks or in other words using the profits to buy their own shares the profits to buy their own shares which is a way of giving money back to which is a way of giving money back to the the investors by driving their share prices investors by driving their share prices up and i am probably preaching to the up and i am probably preaching to the converted here but converted here but seeing these results it is hard to seeing these results it is hard to overstate just overstate just how much technology is going to eat up how much technology is going to eat up everything in the future from everything in the future from fun to work and everything in between fun to work and everything in between and if you'd like to get a deeper more and if you'd like to get a deeper more fundamental understanding of how fundamental understanding of how technology works technology works there's no better place to do that than there's no better place to do that than over at brilliant over at brilliant brilliant is science and engineering brilliant is science and engineering taught in an incredibly engaging and taught in an incredibly engaging and effective way for example their computer effective way for example their computer science classes go through a series of science classes go through a series of interactive lessons that each teach you interactive lessons that each teach you a different principle from programming a different principle from programming to learning about the fundamentals of to learning about the fundamentals of algorithms data structures algorithms data structures cryptocurrencies neural networks etc you cryptocurrencies neural networks etc you have all the basic building blocks have all the basic building blocks and there are applied classes that and there are applied classes that step-by-step breakdown how things like step-by-step breakdown how things like for example search engines are built for example search engines are built there are exercises for every concept there are exercises for every concept that you learn along the way so it's fun that you learn along the way so it's fun and you actually actively practice what and you actually actively practice what you learn you learn and their classes range from beginner to and their classes range from beginner to pretty advanced pretty advanced my favorite class on brilliant was the my favorite class on brilliant was the one covering computer memory which one covering computer memory which finally made me finally made me fully understand how computers actually fully understand how computers actually store and access information store and access information instead of just my vague guesses from instead of just my vague guesses from before and i use the knowledge that i before and i use the knowledge that i got from brilliant all the time in my got from brilliant all the time in my job of trying to make sense of the tech job of trying to make sense of the tech industry whether it is for industry whether it is for a job or for getting better at school or a job or for getting better at school or just for becoming smarter in general just for becoming smarter in general brilliant and its daily challenges are brilliant and its daily challenges are like a gentle like a

were quite impressed with Hawaii's flagship the p30 Pro so let's take a look at the smaller while AP 30 it's missing a few of the higher-end features but with a lower price is it the better deal I'm will for GSM marina and this is a Maui p30 review [Music] the huawei P 30 is made from Gorilla Glass with an aluminum frame pretty typical for a flagship these days as you'd expect from Huawei there are plenty of brilliant color schemes to choose from ours is called breeding crystal and is gorgeous you can see multiple hues reflected in the shiny finish unlike the p30 pro the p30 only has an IP 53 rating for dust and splash proofing not full water resistance so it can handle some raindrops but better not drop this phone in the pool the p30 feels sturdy and well made and with this light compact size is quite easy to use with one hand at 6.1 inches the screen of the p30 is a bit smaller than its siblings but it is indeed an AMOLED with the same 1080p resolution this screen is flat not curved at the edges like the pro model it's personal preference but I like this style better to avoid accidental screen activations while I'm holding it the selfie cam system a small rounded notch at the top and you are able to mask it with a black bar if that's your thing at 422 PPI content on the display looks pretty sharp you have those deep blacks only Amal eyes can provide and colors can be decently accurate if you tweak them in settings maximum brightness is quite good too at 449 nits in manual mode and up to 600 35 minutes in auto mode in bright conditions legibility in the Sun is great we had no issues using the phone outdoors like most animal eyes you have the option for an always-on display to show you time and notifications while the phone sleeps there is no option for a notification LED though just like the p30 pro you can wake up and unlock the p30 with the under display fingerprint reader it's really accurate and its speed is pretty impressive you can also use face unlock but it's not quite as secure as your finger as far as high-tech features go the p30 is missing the pro versions under display acoustic earpiece for calls here is the traditional one up on the top bezel we are a bit disappointed that Huawei didn't take the opportunity to use the air piece in a stereo speaker setup but the p20 didn't have one either the single speaker is next to the USB C port its loudness is excellent and there's no distortion at max volume [Music] the p30 has a 3.5 millimeter jack unlike the pro version so you don't need to worry about using an adapter to plug in headphones volume wise it's only above-average but it has better stereo separation than this bigger sibling our p30 has a hundred and twenty eight gigs of on-board storage though there are options for 64 and 256 gigs depending on where you buy it it's expandable via the hybrid dual SIM slots but you need to use one of huawei's proprietary NM cards which is kind of limiting the interface of the p30 is hallways emui 9.1 over android 9pi just like on the p30 pro version 9.1 brings a new ER ofs file system files can be read faster and operating system files take up less space as typical of emui all of your apps are kept on the home screen by default but you can opt to use an app drawer if you want swiping down on the home screen opens an app search bar and a swipe down from the top will get you the notification shade swiping to the left opens a Google newsfeed and there is gesture navigation available which works just as smoothly as on hallways other recent devices unlike a pro version there's no IR blaster on the p30 so you'll have to find some other way to turn on your TV at the heart of the p30 is hallways top-tier karin 980 chipset along with the six or eight gigs of ram performance is awesome just like on the p30 pro though graphics power is just a little behind the snapdragon 855 regardless everything feels nice and fluid the p30 pro comes with GPU turbo 2.0 as well which optimizes performance and smooths out frame rates for a few supported games such as pop G at three thousand six hundred and fifty million powers the p30s batteries have been smaller than the pro versions and unfortunately you don't get the same exceptional battery life here it's still good though the p30 earned an endurance rating of 83 hours in our proprietary tests about in the middle of what the competition offers you can top up the battery with a twenty two point five watt Huawei supercharge it isn't 40 watts like on the p30 pro but it's still really impressive getting us from 0 to 65 percent in 30 minutes you don't get support for wireless charging or reverse charging like you do on the pro model though bummer the Huawei P 30 has a triple camera setup instead of the quad cam we see the more expensive p30 pro here's a 40 megapixel main camera a pixel telephoto cam and the 16 megapixel ultra wide camera all with like a branded lenses compared to the pro model the main cameras lens isn't as bright @f 1.8 instead of f 1.6 and this one doesn't have a is the telephoto camera is borrowed from the may 20 pro and doesn't have a fancy periscope setup the ultra wide-angle camera is a bit different and there is no tof cam for depth sensing since the main 40 megapixel camera uses a quad Bayer filter the default output is 10 megapixels in daylight image quality is great practically identical to the p30 pro there's plenty of detail pleasing colors wide dynamic range and nice rendition you can opt to shoot in 40 megapixels though these shots aren't necessarily packing more detail certain scenes do benefit from being shot in this mode and it varies so it may be worth playing around with now under the ultra wide-angle cam colors are a bit punchier than on the main cam and dynamic range isn't quite as wide but perfectly acceptable though its field of view isn't quite as wide as on the p30 pro we'd say that in good light the p30 Zulte relied cam is almost as good you can also use the ultra wide-angle cam to shoot in super macro mode which allows you to focus on objects that are extremely close if the subject is still and there's plenty of light you can end up with some really nice results even though the telephoto camera can't zoom as far as the periscope one on the p30 pro it does a great job images come out sharp and detailed the dynamic range and contrast aren't quite what you get on the main cam but you still get that nice color rendition the p30s main cam and telephoto work together in portrait mode how they interact depends on your zoom level regardless of the zoom portraits have excellent subject separation and very nice background blur in low-light we expected a bit lower quality from the P 30s main camera compared to the pro version as it turns out there's no need to worry low light shots are excellent they're well exposed with nicely preserved highlights loss of detail low noise and nice colors night mode is one of our favorite features on this camera you get brighter night skies and livelier colors and some recovered detail in highlights and shadows compared to the main camera low-light shots with the ultra wide cam aren't very good coming out soft and noisy night mode really helps the ultra wide Camelot giving you a brighter exposure and bringing the quality up from barely usable to pretty decent if you try to zoom in the dark the phone either does a digital crop or switches to the telephoto cam depending on the level of light just like with the other cameras night mode does a good job in improving these two for selfies the p30 has the same 32 megapixel front facing cameras the p30 pro which has fixed focus you have to make sure that the phone is the right distance away from your face in order to get the sharpest result and it's not necessarily a full arms length it does a respectable job nonetheless there's excellent dynamic range spot-on colors and plenty of detail the Huawei P 30 can record video with any of its 3 cams and 4k at 30fps electronic stabilization is available on all cameras in all modes but you can't disable it if you wanted to quality wise 4k footage from the main camera is quite the same as on the p30 pro there's excellent dynamic range true to life color rendition and great contrast resolve detail isn't the best we've seen though and we wish the image was a bit sharper footage from the ultra wide cam is passable but not great dynamic range and detail at both lesson stellar video shot with the telephoto camera lets you get close to the action and offer reasonable quality as well while detail is again not spectacular there isn't much competition out there that can offer three times optical zoom so that's the flowey P 30 you get an eye-catching design good battery life a gorgeous display cutting edge performance and a versatile triple camera but compared to the p30 pro you are missing quite a few things look that curved screen and waterproofing there's no IR blaster or wireless charging here and you don't get the in display earpiece as far as the camera goes you don't have oh is or a tof camera and just forget about a fancy periscope telephoto can but all of that said all of these things are more of a luxury than a necessity and definitely not a deal-breaker for most people and since you're saving at least a hundred and fifty euros here the p30 is worth considering over the more expensive model even with this compromises this is one of the best flagships you can get right now and it definitely deserves our recommendation thanks for watching guys and see you on the next one you is halo bobbin android version 10 person colors tinta green color blue and black color tint available at our uh rear camera holo which only eight megapixel are

here let's unbox and check it out and you heard right we're looking at the huawei band 6 checking out the features looking at the stuff it tracks and also test let's go here we go the huawei band 6. i'm so happy i got it in pink finally so this has all the long spo2 monitoring a full view display and long battery life on the back gives us a tiny preview of the stuff that this thing can do so again sp02 monitoring this is a 1.47 amoled full view display long battery life all day heart rate monitoring 96 workout modes fast charging water resistance truesport algorithm and sleep tracking nice we have the band right here but let's see what else this comes with first quick start guide charging cradle so that is a nice like champagne rose gold um face or sides of the face the straps are pink and they're silicone and i love that i finally got the pink one that is nice and soft it feels like it's gonna be comfortable to wear we have the sensors on the back we have one button on the right side so let's power it up and set this baby up [Music] [Applause] like other bands it connects to your phone by a bluetooth on the huawei health pack i also tried it with my iphone and it did connect as of right now this band is connected to the iphone 12 mini and so the huawei band 6 can pretty much connect to any phone that you can download the huawei health app too so let's take a quick huawei band 6 tour so this is a bright and nice screen tap to hold and you can change to different wash faces like there are a lot and a lot of them are cute ones depending on the wash phase it can change what stats you see on the screen so for example i want this to be steps instead you can do that okay well both are steps now swiping right gives you your heart rate stress levels um temperature music control and these are your stats for the day swiping left cycles through the same swiping down gives you a quick menu you have do not disturb screen time on find my phone alarm and then settings under settings you have display the different watch faces your favorites so meaning when you swipe to the right this is the order so you can customize what you see on the band and then you have brightness settings we are set at three of course you can do one up until five now you won't really see the change because my camera is set for you not to see that to adjust but yeah know that it's there swiping up gives you notifications because this is after all connected to your phone on the right we find the one and only button and that button serves to wake up your watch or it brings you to this menu which you know we'll discuss in a hot second i am loving the fact that this pink but you guys already know that this thing also comes in three other different colors this thing does have a bigger screen obviously definitely bigger than the huawei band 4 that it came after not the band 5 even if this is the 6 it was the huawei band 4 and then the huawei band 6. but the screen is also not as big as the screen on the huawei watch fit which i've previously tested out as well except not in pink the huawei pan 6 is basically an in-between so it's in that tiny space in the middle of smart vans and smart watches it's a comfortable screen experience because it is bigger but the band is still lightweight enough for you to have on your wrist always with a 5 8 am rating this thing can always be on your wrist including when you wash your hands or when you shower but it's not advisable to wear this thing when swimming or when snorkeling or stuff like that general everyday solutions splash though this can take it the huawei band 6 allows for smartphone notifications and you can customize which notifications you get on the wrist however you can't reply from the band and neither can you answer calls because there is no mic or speakers on this one cool feature that i always love on wearables would be the remote camera shutter this is honestly perfect for selfie otds however from testing i was only able to do it on a huawei phone and not on the iphone there's also a find my phone function always very useful and of course you can control your music from your phone via this band fitness wise this band can count your steps it does 24 7 heart rate tracking with as little as one minute intervals and ai can adjust these intervals according to your activities there's sleep tracking complete with very detailed sleep stages and spo2 tracking which is a feature that everyone's been looking for in wearables though reminder that blood oxygen tracking on wearables still cannot replace actual medical advice menstrual tracking is also available on this van which is pretty nice i love that menstrual tracking and all of these wearables is something that's being normalized again however this feature disappeared when i connected it to the iphone there are a number of exercises here and depending on which exercise you can choose goals like time calories or depending on exercise distance or also skips i decided to actually exercise to test this out that's a six i did five i did 59 it says 57 but trips look legit i've tripped twice should be 69 68 but two trips i've tripped thrice so it says i've tripped thrice but i've shipped like four times actually it also gives you current streaks 165. it's a little delayed now it says 168. i did my hair it didn't change 168. 200 skips 203 says 205 right i think that's enough skipping for today like any wearable it's not 100 accurate but it's not that bad i do love though that this band gives you the option to do reminders while you're exercising not all fitness wearables do that i would however love shorter interval times because the shortest you can do is one minute i would love as little as let's say a 30 second interval you can also set it to alarm if you reach a certain heart rate which i feel is like a good safety feature now i'm not gonna run outdoors to test it out not because it's a pandemic but because i'm not really a runner but this thing does have connected gps meaning if you have it connected to your phone it'll be able to track where you actually ran in drew huawei smartwatch fashion because we all know that huawei smartwatches have really good battery life they promise two weeks power now i've not had this band long enough to test that two week power i've had this watch for five days and from the box i have not charged on the 16 it was at 71 today is the 19th and i'm at 34 mind you this was with me turning everything on and testing everything out and having the screen on always because i was shooting the watch the huawei band 6 is very interesting to me because i feel like it's a very specific answer to a very specific group of people who want a very specific thing in their wearables a feature pack bang for bug device but with a better screen not too big though just enough to see more but still small enough to be comfy to wear but with this tiny change i feel like this cheap because the band line after all is the cheapest in huawei's wearable line but i feel the cheap wearable experience to be also slightly different and if you're that type of user that i mentioned this tiny change can make a huge impact right that's it for today's vid let me know what you think about the huawei band 6. comment down below what your thoughts are if you want to see how i use my tech on a daily basis find me online that's isa does underscore on instagram twitter and tick tock and on tiktak i answer your questions real time so see you there until next time the mate 20 pro is probably the smartphone that i've done to death on this channel i mean i absolutely adore the phone for its design it's power it's versatility it's incredible camera suite i mean it was the first huawei phone that i properly used and got to appreciate the camera performance i'm always really into cameras in smartphones but this one in particular it just blew me away this time though i'm looking at the mate 20 pro through the context of not having them with google services obviously the mate 20 pro still does but it's outdated at this point and that's what i want to get on to today so thanks to the wonderful damien wilde for sending out the mate 20 pro is it still worth buying how good is it how well has it aged and yeah hey guys my name is ryan thomas and this is my review of the mate 20 pro in 2021 story to a the first thing i noticed about this mate 20 pro is that it's nowhere near as big in the context of the rest of the market and i mean physically more recent smartphones have six point six six point eight almost seven inch displays at this point and the six point three eight inch quad hd amoled 60 hertz is nowhere near as glamorous as today's standards but it still looks great thanks to the use of a pixel dense contrast heavy panel that works really nicely with thin bezels say for the big notch at the top of course i'm really glad we've moved on from the notches i mean this thing is huge although it never really bothered me and it still doesn't bother me but a lot of people would be turned off by the big notch apple still does it though so yeah i don't know this has one of the earlier implementations of the in-display fingerprint scanners and as a result isn't as quick nor reliable to get into as many recent releases i have particular issues with in-display fingerprint scanners they just don't work very well for me but this one seems to be all right sort of a five out of ten with the galaxy s10 being a 10 out of 10 and the oneplus 7t being an almost zero out of 10. i'm going to get this out of the way as early on as possible for 180 pounds you're getting an awful lot of smartphone for your money sure the kirin 980 and 8 gigabytes of ram is not a huge amount of smartphone you're not getting super fast speeds you're getting adequate performance across the board i'm not a gamer and so i don't really appreciate super high-end chipsets as much as people who do gain more with them who's gonna feel the higher frame rates but this one in particular is good like it got me through you know social media usage switching between applications i didn't feel huge amounts of lag or any hangs there was a tiny amount of lag here and there but really it was overall a pretty good experience for me and yeah i mean to be fair i do play the odd 2d game and for that this thing worked just fine and again to put into context this thing is half the price of a brand new pixel 4a that is mental battery life on this unit is still fantastic a full day's usage absolutely no problem with the mate 20 pro with plenty of mobile data usage high brightness everything like that i remember this phone having good battery life but even now i mean it's just phenomenal oh and on top of that you get 40 watt wide charging and 15 watt wireless charging so the overall battery package is just phenomenal unfortunately i didn't have time to extensively test it so through my full day i ended the day with around 30 to 40 percent battery life however i didn't get to test over a week as i've got quite a lot of phones in at the moment so i just tested it through the day we have to talk about software with huawei phones purely out of fairness new huawei phones don't support google services which is a huge bummer for the brand in the west and is largely why xiaomi has been able to capture so much of the market over here the mate 20 pro is stuck on android 9 which is soon to become three generations out of date so a lot of people this is going to be a concern but i think it's an unwarranted one for a lot of people who just want a used smartphone that's gonna work that's gonna run their social media applications for a good year or so that's basically how i stand with this because no one paying 180 pounds for a huawei smartphone is expecting the best of the best and if they are they are deluded hint need an ebay rant very soon would i recommend you go out of your way to buy phone with software this out of date if you didn't care about it before absolutely not you should buy something newer or something with better support across the board however if you are particularly interested in the mate 20 pro and you don't care about having the latest and greatest software i don't think you're going to have much issue with this the cameras are a particular area of huawei phones that tend to be ahead of the curve if anything though the mate 20 pro was one of those phones and even two and a half years on the mate 20 pro's cameras are incredibly impressive there's a 40 megapixel main a 20 megapixel ultrawide and an 8 megapixel telephoto along with a 24 megapixel selfie camera not bad at all huawei's processing style which includes a lot of contrast is one that i've preferred over the past couple of years i like the way the cameras are able to capture dynamic range while keeping an interesting look to the image so it doesn't overdo lifting the shadows like apple does these days with its processing as of late it's not just quality which the mate 20 pro excels in but also its versatility and continuity of quality throughout the three main rear cameras the ultra wide and three times telephoto cameras complement the main shooter well to create a great camera experience instead of just a great main camera like a lot of mid-range and upper mid-range 2021 devices get away with is there a quality drop-off between the three yeah of course there is but nothing like what you'd see from the newer mid-ranges and certainly not at this price point but it's not just the quality in which the mate 20 pro excels it's also in its versatility and continuity of quality throughout its three main rear cameras the ultrawide and three times telephoto cameras complement the main shooter well to create a great camera package instead of just a one-shot hero like a lot of the mid-rangers are doing right now is there a quality drop-off yeah but nothing like what you will see from those newer mid-ranges and certainly not at this price point huawei's cameras excel thanks to their combination of class leading hardware and software they do make some of the best camera packages in the world and as a result of this the mate 20 pro is just a good option even a number of years down the line it stands out as one of the best camera smartphones under 500 pounds so it all comes down to this should you actually go out and spend almost 200 pounds on the huawei mate 20 pro well if you're after a really solid smartphone that does a lot of things right but just doesn't quite manage to get the software right then maybe you should get the mate 20 pro i mean if it was up to date with the latest and greatest google software at least a little bit newer maybe android 10 or android 11 i could forgive it but it's on android 9 and at this point it is getting a little bit stale like it's still a fantastic phone with custom software i'm sure you could do a lot with it but as it stands it's not the best smartphone to go out and buy right now even though it pains me to say it as a huge fan of the mate 20 pro i would own one i would use one like personally but i don't care about having the latest and greatest software and i'm not too worried about the security issues and stuff like that however there are going to be a lot of people out there that this does bring up concern for them all of this smartphone for half the price of a pixel 4a are you kidding me of course i'd buy one of course i'd use one the amount of memories that i made almost using this thing like years and years ago taking loads of photos loads of videos i made videos about the thing it almost got 100k views my first review of this thing and yeah i have a big a strong relationship with the mate 20 pro and maybe that makes me a little bit biased but the overall package you're getting fantastic cameras fantastic battery life good enough performance a good enough screen really nice design of course that's more subjective and you're getting it for half the price of a pixel 4a i mean yeah that if that doesn't screen value to you what does but as i said cannot recommend it for the vast majority of people due to its software unfortunately although you still get the google play store and it works just fine but there we are anyway i want to give a massive thanks to damian wilde for sending out the mate 20 pro for me to review it's something that i wanted to re-look at for a little while now so i'm really appreciative of him and he's provided a lot of phones for the channel as of late so do check out his social media in the video description along with my social media and of course my patreon link and thank you so much for watching please do like comment and subscribe if you're new around here to never miss a video like this one i've been ride thomas and i'll catch you later The development that happened to TV screen is huge. Huawei releases a number of devices and other technologies. Their screens are now available in KSA. I made a video before about your questions and inquiries. But in this video, I'll discuss the full experiment
 with this Huawei Vision S screen. The first thing you'll notice is that it looks like a 
painting hanging on the wall. At your workplace, if you have a screen, then it'll be useful for you with a number of use cases. It'll be useful for meetings, watching content. It won't be just a screen hanging on the wall, but it'll show art,  which 
will enrich your experience in tandem with the Huawei ecosystem. Let's find out more about the Huawei Vision S and 
whether it is suitable for you. I'll discuss the specs, features and what to keep 
in mind before you make a decision to buy it. [Intro] And indeed, at workplace, having this screen makes a big difference. The screen comes with the camera out of the box. Having a camera that can be easily installed and 
removed is great for privacy. Using the camera with apps such as the MeeTime 
will be great for meetings. You can hold meetings with a number of users, especially
 those that adopt the Huawei ecosystem.. The MeeTime app supports 1080p resolution, which is great for meetings. The screen also supports 120Hz refresh rate with supported apps. It also provides a beautiful sound experience. It is also compatible with other Huawei devices around it. For
 example, the Mate 40 Pro can turn into a remote control. Before I continue, the screen comes with 2 sizes: 55" and 65". The price starts from 3499 SAR, which is logical for 
all the specs and features it offers. With preorders, you'll get gifts that costs 2042 SAR if still available.
 I'll a link in the video description to buy it should you choose it. This screen is 65",  and it has served us very well here. Let me now discuss the camera. It attaches to the
 screen using magnets. The camera can be redirected. The camera is 13MP, and the screen itself comes 
with 6 Far-Field Voice Pickup mics. These mics will offer clear audio will recording or in calls. These Far-field Voice Pickup mics will be able to pickup 
your audio from across the room. The Vision S' camera can be used for the MeeTime service. It is a video call service from Huawei available in their ecosystem. It supports video calls with FHD resolution and offers
 high stability in most conditions. The video quality of the video calls depends on how
 fast your connection is. The higher the connection's speed, the better the video calls will be. If you receive a MeeTime call on your Huawei smartphone, you 
can immediately send the call to the Huawei Vision S screen. The camera can be used to record videos and take photos. It also offers a wide viewing angle. You can record your moments in your living room. And in my case, I can record moments in the meetings room. I can record the meetings I have in this meeting room. I can record while having a meeting at the same time. This personally helps me in my business. The screen supports 120Hz refresh rate. Content that support 120Hz refresh rate will be 
supported on this screen. But for now, the 120Hz refresh rate content is only 
available with the first party apps from Huawei. But it is supposed to increase with time. Gaming consoles and the HDMI ports found on the 
screen won't support 120Hz refresh rate. The screen, in addition, supports 4K resolution. And it comes with the HDMI 2.0 port. One of the features that are supported on the 
screen is called Smart MEMC. This technology will up the refresh rate to 120Hz. For example, if the content's refresh rate is 24, 30 
or 60Hz, it'll be upped to 120Hz. This will happen with the supported content. The Smart MEMC only supports content with high resolution. The screen supports Huawei Share technology. With it, you can broadcast the screen of the Mate 40 
on the screen with a single tap on the remote control. The screen comes with an app called Huawei Vision, 
which will give you more controls. The app supports a feature called Mirror Control, which turns your 
smartphone to a smart tool that helps you control the screen. And with the app,  the Mate 40 Pro will turn into 
a small screen to control the Vision S screen. You can control the screen using touch gestures. With the Huawei Share feature, you can send Android
 apps to the screen and install them. These apps must first be supported by the HMS Mobile. Apps will work perfectly, but some apps won't since 
they're not supported by the screen's HarmonyOS. Some apps can be controlled using the Mirror Control 
feature using your smartphone. Apps installed from third parry sources can be installed 
on work perfectly on the screen. These apps include Netflix and Zoom. Apps compatibility might change depending on
 future updates of these apps. Which might force you to reinstall the app on the screen again. One of the things I've experimented with is to broadcast
 games to the screen from the Mate 40 Pro device. You can then game on the screen while using
 the smartphone for controls. We tested PUBG, and it offered an acceptable quality, 
but the frames drop a bit while playing. According to Huawei, when using the Mirror Control feature 
for broadcasting from the app  the latency will be around 30ms. And when broadcasting without the app, the latency will be 60ms. The screen supports Huawei Sound system, which 
offers 4 speakers; each one is 10W. Two of them are tweeters. And I already discussed them in the previous videos. The screen supports Dolby Audio and DTS - HD technologies. The performance in general is very good, and the 
audio quality is clear. The audio system supports a technology 
called Intelligent Audio Vision Mode. This technology will adjust the audio to offer the best quality. What I like about this screen is that you can listen to audio content
 using the Huawei Music app even if the screen is turned off. You won't have to buy a sound bar with this screen. 
The screen itself will double as a sound bar. The sound bar will enrich the audio experience, especially 
if supports the audio technologies in the screen itself. But in this case, the screen is taken full advantages of. It can be used as a painting on the wall,  a sound bar, 
a screen for meetings and a recording camera! Supporting all of these features could make a 
great option for lots of users. The Huawei Video app will present you with lots of video content. The app allows you to watch Live Channels directly
 from the app using internet connection. It supports nearly 100 channels, MBC network included. The app also offers a huge Hollywood and Arabic 
library among many others. It also offers a library for kids. And with one subscription from your phone, you 
can also use it on your screen. The Video+ feature is also available on the screen. 
You can also enjoy a free trial. The screen is great for homes. This screen here is in the workplace, so I won't make a
 Video+ subscription so that they won't be distracted. The video you're watching now is from the videos 
available on the channel, and it is a 4K video. The pre-orders for this screen will start in 3rd of June. And like I said before, price starts from 3499 SAR. Here's a list of other currencies. If you pre-order it, you'll get a gift package that costs 2042 SAR. I'll leave a link to it for pre-orders in the video description. The screen is packed with features, but I don't 
want to make the video long. It comes with a great remote, it supports AI, you can use to transfer and broadcast
 videos and photos. There are lots of things that you can do with this screen. It is suitable for homes and workplaces. Evaluate your needs and check how this screen
 will be helpful for you. Don't miss the other videos I made about this screen. This is the end. Glory and praise be to Allah. I witness there is no 
God but Allah.  I ask Allah for forgiveness and I repent to Him. See you later. Honestly, using the screen to show art is way 
better than turning it off. ultra graphics high graphics flagship device oneplus 8 pro actually how's latin gaming phones rog phone 3 lenovo legion phone and even see nubia red magic 5s ultra settings

future with the phones specs from a very well-known brand subscribe hit that bell icon so that you don't miss it beans and you're watching unboxed there is hello and welcome to my review of the huawei media Pad m3 this is a brand new device just been released in September 2016 I guess I have one of the first ones here and then no proper reviews out there at least hardly so I thought I'd do one myself because reviews help me a lot when I make a buying decision so I thought maybe I could help somebody out there with his or her buying decision so this is not my usual profession sorry if the production quality isn't up to the standards that you might know from tech tablets or Android Authority I really love those two I'll do my best okay so we'll be talking about the hardware the design the build quality we'll be talking about the screen we will not be doing any benchmarks because you can just get those somewhere else we'll be talking about the software and we'll be talking about the phone feature because you can make phone calls with this 8.4 inch tablet so let's have a look at the hardware first at the top you have an audio jack three point five millimeters I really don't like the whole idea of audio jacks being at the top of a phone because usually I put it into my pocket that way and then the audio jack is at the bottom which is strange somehow this is one of the two speakers you have a volume rocker here and a power button and at the bottom you have a microphone microUSB connector which is a bit strange actually considering lace the end of 2016 and type-c is quite common l and I would have expected the type C on it but it's okay for me there's the second loudspeaker and I can tell you the audio quality is amazing and here is a micro SD extension slot with sic you can take up to 64 gigabytes at least that is what the spec says and what i've tried i haven't put in my 128 yet and if you have the LTE version as i have then you can put in a nano SIM too which I always like and want to have and the build quality in the design is really really nice you have a wonderful metal edge perfectly cut at the back you have a metal back tiny little bit of plastic at the top which I don't mind at all and you have a little bit of plastic here probably for the antennas so it feels really sturdy and stable you can't there's no creaking or crunching or any noises if you put pressure on it it looks apps be superb and I must say the build quality is amazing until now I thought the build quality of iPhones is the best and then it's HTC but I must say where we have really been upping their game and I'm comparing this to an iPad pro 2 to a success HTC ones and the media paddocks - and I must say always getting better and better and you will be very happy with the build at least I am and I'm really nice the screen is an 8.4 inch screen it gives you 2560 x 1600 at 359 dpi and believe me this video does it no justice whatsoever the screen is fantastic and it's also one of the main reasons I've bought it no matter what you do with it you can watch video you can look at photos you can read texts or with me then lots of emails per day and it always looks great you slam your nose onto the screen start looking for pixels and you will not see them it's really really great and where we give use gives you some very nifty ways of using that screen estate which we'll be getting into very soon at the bottom we have a fingerprint scanner and I must say that's one of the first Android fingerprint scanners that I have seen that works really well it super fast it will work nine point five out of ten times and were--we has done a few very nice things with it because they have they let you swipe over it and you get the application switcher and you can touch it once for back and you can touch and hold for home screen so it's very nice to navigate with it if you've only got one and a half hands free at the moment you can you can do some basic navigation with it so that is very nice talked about the screen and I've compared it to an iPad pro 2 which is a round about 10-inch device and that has slightly more slightly higher resolution and you don't see much of a difference and this device is 350 to 400 euros and the iPad pro is something around 900 and more so as a huge quality that you get for this amount of money so let's have a look at a few things here so what I really would like to show is watching video is not too sure if I get into any DMCA or copyright problems I'll just start one of the videos here and the quality of the sound just put in some kids video the quality of the sound is really amazing I'll turn it all up and then you it is clear very clear stereo and you you really enjoy using it usually if I if I compared to my other tablets and devices especially to the x2 the media paddocks - which is a 7 inch tablet the sound quality is greatly improved and I haven't found many other devices are even comparable sound wise so it really does its name justice it has a superb screen and it has superb audio quality so if you're using it to consume media this is one of the best devices that you can get really really happy with that it's huge fun to use and has some hitches if I go to the O now it works ok well um sometimes it crashes on the subscriptions tab sometimes it doesn't you have to update all the software words that's on there otherwise quite a few things won't be working properly ok so it has a flavor end of Android on it and that is the emui which is for sense for emotion UI so it's not a stock Android you will see that because it looks a bit different quite a bit different the notification tab is different the options that you have a different or the way they're set up you can customize quite a bit what I really like here is that Huawei gives you some very nice ways of using the screen estate because usually if you have such a huge resolution on a smaller device things just tend to be big and you don't really see a lot more so if I put my 5.5 inch jus three advanced next to it or my TC 1 next to it you won't see much more on the big 8.4 inch screen so you're losing a lot of screen estate but although there are a few very nice ways of switching it and changing it getting the most out of it for one you can under display you can say the font size say that should be small so then the fonts' get smaller and you can change the view mode and say you want it much smaller and it tries to explain it to you know you this proto is cupped slightly and this one is above the fold now so now I have much more estate on the screen like see much more than I could usually and that is absolutely wonderful of course you can cry and connect it to your PC and use ADB and change the DPI but that doesn't seem to work for me at the moment and there are no routing options at the moment so I have to live with what Huawei offers me and that's quite a lot actually then there are some very nice other features in here where we allows you to customize a lot concerning themes coloring and other features so that's quite nice I know that a lot of people complain about um UI but I must say of all the Android skins it is a bit clumsy it is a bit bit well complicate well not complicated but sort of it gets in your way sometimes I get that but otherwise you can do a lot of things with it and I wouldn't use it as a launcher I would always use Nova Launcher so that's ok for me and you have all kinds of extra options and things to set up so um must say I'm I'm really enjoying this one thing that I don't like is that the standard keyboard that is set is huawei swipe and that's a keyboard that keyboard that telephones home and sends some kind of data somewhere so you shouldn't be putting in passwords without a keyboard so I switched it to Google keyboard um and I try to then move backwards and forwards depending on what kind of text I'm putting in and inputs I'm doing ok so you've got 24 gigabytes of free memory on the phone 25 at no 22 actually is is 3 and 25 is the total size and you can extend that with your memory and battery life have been using it now for quite some time and I guess you can get something like well you get more than a full day of heavy usage out of it of course if you're watching videos all day all the time you will not but I had a full day of 12 hours with heavy usage on it lots of surfing a few videos but mainly work screen on phone calls and it's reached 35 percent so that is really amazing I really like that and all in all I must say I am very much enjoying this tablet and what I really don't like is a problem with the phone feature because you can use it as a standard phone okay so you can have your contacts in here and the other numbers or search the people type in parts of their names to get the names up and then call them but the problem is and you might see it here there is no loudspeaker for your ear so the loudspeaker that is used for a phone call is you've guessed it that one so when you're in a phone call it's like when if you've got a normal smartphone it's exactly like when you put the loudspeaker on on your phone so everyone around you can always hear what your what the other person the line is talking and saying simply because it's using the large loudspeaker and the loud loudspeaker up here and that's not directed into your ear it's set to quite loud and even if you take the minimal loudness people around you will be able to listen to the full conversation so you have to use it with a headset I know it's a bit strange usually wouldn't I mean I can have got small hands and hardly hold it you wouldn't want to hold it right to your face and make the phone call with it but sometimes that might just happen and then it's impossible to make a phone call with that that's a bit sad I usually have a headset connected so that's not a huge issue but it's a bit disappointing let's put it like that otherwise it fits into a pocket actually which is amazing I just have standard jeans on and I can it into my pocket it does bulge a bit but it can work actually so it is much more mobile than you'd think it would be and it's not thick at all so you can really have it with you and that amazes me and it allows you to get so much work done or consume so much media and read it's really amazing so I would really I would keep it you know um in Europe we can send it back after 14 days within 14 days without with no questions asked and the phone features the only feature that is really disturbing me a bit so I'm still thinking of maybe sending it back or not but otherwise all other things surpassed all my expectations by far tech wise there's no route for it at the moment there are some reports on XDA and Android forums comm I think that people have unlocked the bootloader that's not too difficult you I use DSR okay I think it's called this okay general huawei unlocker and then you have to pay a few dollars for that and get an unlock so that's fine but I haven't managed to get a super su on it and root it in any way but I guess because it's so fresh and that's not possible at the moment at least and I don't feel like getting into the details and trying to do that all myself ok so I hope this review has helped you um if you're buying it because the phone feature beware that it doesn't have a proper loudspeaker for phone calls only the one at the top for everyone who wants to use it for media consumption get it you will not regret it and for business users are looking for a powerful but not too large android-based tablet that is very nice too so all in all it's an amazing device I hope I have helped you and yeah from bye-bye [Music] hi everyone this is jd your gadget review friend we're continuing to review and compare devices and i'll flash our schedule for the next couple of weeks you can also check our twitter community at gadgetrev now for updates last thursday i was watching a presentation of harmony os and as a tech enthusiast i'm excited about it just a quick history of huawei it's been two years now may 2019 when former president donald trump banned huawei on using and installing google services because of allegedly spying on american government not sure about that but the ban happened the day after exactly two years huawei came up with a permanent solution to fix it and that's making their own operating system for their huawei devices let's take a look on harmony os and to save you time watching a couple of hours long presentation from huawei these are my six things you need to know about the harmony os hey don't forget to subscribe my friend let's go start with our first observation it looks like an ios and android os interface the icon looks like ios because of the emui and the notification looks like similar to an android os i even thought they're showing an android phone in the first few minutes only to realize it was harmony os i think it's a good thing for all of us since huawei phone owners are familiar with android and ios interface this is a confident and familiar look to us it looks like the android 12 with a stronger accent on colors for its notification tray i don't have any issues with it i thought it was a good move but hopefully they can bring something new and exciting about the aesthetics like feeling of navigating a new os not just a copy of ios and android os but all good because it works the second thing i notice is the quick pairing and connectivity across all huawei devices they talk about it for the first 30 minutes and really the whole presentation revolves around connectivity of huawei devices for smartphones huawei vision which is their television smart watches and speakers it's an invitation because they're trying to create an ecosystem around their products harmony os offers easy pairing by just dragging the icons of the other devices into your phone it's the same concept of what we had on android devices android lists the names of the devices well harmony os gives you an icon for these devices i just have a quick question on it how will the icon look like when the consumer use a third-party devices such as cameras for instance or tiles will harmony always supports these devices and while the icon looks like a generic device you know how neat the icon will look like on third-party devices and i was just hoping in the future if they succeed with this that they would also offer computational driven platforms outside their mobility like mac computers for apple and chromebooks for google because in their presentation i only see four devices being offered on huawei's ecosystem the next thing they showed us is that sleek home screen experience so two things i get from their quick presentation about their home screen is if you drag two apps in one folder the home screen settings will recommend to group other apps with similar function if it's gaming sports or social media this is not new to huawei as their previous phones with emui are already doing this like my other review units like huawei nova 7i or huawei p40 with a stripped-down version of android os also when you group apps together there's an option to expand or make a bigger folder looks like a widget although i was thinking you might want to group the same app to save space enlarging it is also a good trick if you want a bigger look on your apps contained in the folder it's a good choice the fourth thing we will get from harmony os is the service widget this is like google cards for news weather train information and so on you will find the widgets on service center and you can drag it in the home screen i guess it's a typical widget we see on android and ios i'm not sure what the difference are and what it offers but it looks similar to what we have in google and apple so this is a direct competition of what we have on those guys i guess developers can create their own widget for their apps if they wanted consumers to easily access their services directly in the home screen the fifth and one of the most important thing is the faster performance next is the promise of faster performance if harmony always can deliver on this it will be a great thing for the company and other manufacturers too this os will seriously make google rhythmic of their strategy how to tweak and maximize the performance of their succeeding android os because i agree with the sentiments of huawei android phones will be so fast in the beginning and as the update comes they will slowly make the phone sluggish give it a couple of months and you will feel some hiccups this will be good to other manufacturers too because they can take advantage of harmony os with mediocre specs they can refocus their energy and resources to other things like r d and lastly like their competition harmony os is an open source so like android os harmony os is also an open source i guess the only way this platform will survive is to provide it for free in that case os developers can come and tweak it to make it better and for app developers so they can populate huawei app gallery without these apps it will be really hard for huawei to sell harmony os and their devices so there you go harmony os presentation is both exciting and a step up to the right direction it's about time that ios and android os have a little bit of competition that windows os cannot deliver there are a good number of followers for huawei and sharing the same sentiment they have on the u.s huawei band would think it's ridiculous and people might give harmony os a second look and try it harmony os presentation is an invitation to developers to jump in huawei's ecosystem if they can get enough apps for people to consider huawei and its new ecosystem this can be a game changer if you enjoy this video consider subscribing we're posting videos of gadget reviews comparisons photography gears and tips the goal of

Hi everyone, welcome to Difference Frames the World,  a channel for you to discover a real China. Today, we would like to talk about  how the Chinese communicate  with each other in daily life,  and also why the US launched a tech war  with China and targeted Huawei.  It is noteworthy that Meng Wanzhou was arrested  in Canada just several months  after Hua Wei surpassed Apple,  becoming the second-largest  phone manufacturer in the world.  Meng Wanzhou is the daughter of Ren Zhengfei,  and is supposedly the successor  to Ren Zhengfay after he retires  from Hua wei, because both her brother, Ren Ping,  and her sister, Yao Anna, are not fit for that position. Let us start the video with WeChat,  an instant messenger from Tencent,  a Chinese internet giant whose subsidiaries  are marketing various Internet-related services  and products, including games,  artificial intelligence, and other technology.  WeChat is its most famous application that connects  1.5 billion Chinese people across the world.  A lot of westerners also start using this app  to communicate with their Chinese friends  and business partners. On the evening of January 19, at Beijing time,  Zhang Xiaolong, WeChat founder,  disclosed  the latest data on WeChat usage:  1.09 billion users access WeChat every day,  among them, 330 million make video calls;  780 million check Moments  and 120 million publish posts on Moments,  360 million read official account articles,  and 400 million use mini-programs. every day, 670 million photos and 100 million short videos  are shared on the friend moments.  as for voice messages and texts,  the data were not disclosed,  but they must in billions, and all of them  are sent and received almost at the same time. the most beautiful part is that you do not have to  pay a penny for all of these,  on the premise that you have unlimited internet data,  which is common in China Mainland. 25 years ago, the Chinese had to pay hundreds of US dollars  for installing a wired phone at home or on his office desk,  and when mobile phones were introduced  to China Mainland by the end of the last century,  users had to pay for making and receiving calls.  if you received a scam call in those days,  you were required to pay for being scammed.  Calling US or Canada numbers from China Mainland  were extremely expensive, around 2 dollars every minute.  And phone calls between different cities in the same region  were also three or four times more expensive  than those in the same jurisdiction area.  One friend from Guangzhou told us that making a call  from downtown Guangzhou, to a satellite township,  like Pan Yu or Hua Du County,  would cost two or three times more  than calling downtown numbers. back in the 1980's, people in China Mainland communicated  with each other mainly through writing letters  or oral messages delivered through acquaintances,  for very urgent things, telegraphs were employed  to convey concisely organized characters.  Because of the distance and inconvenience  of getting in touch with each other,  ancient people wrote letters very seriously  and could express their feelings more intimately.  A lot of famous Chinese literary writings,  like proses and verses, are actually letters  between friends or family members. This verse on screen is one of the most famous works  written by Su Shi to his young brother, Su Zhe,  another famous writer in Sung Dynasty,  one thousand years ago. And this is a letter from Si Maqian,  China's greatest historian,  born over two thousand years ago,   to his friend, Ren An.  A lot of Chinese expressions or idioms  are from this letter.  It has encouraged millions of Chinese  to make achievements  over ordeals and difficulties.  The author himself had been castrated,  a lifelong disgrace for a man in all ages,  when he wrote this letter. A lot of Chinese calligraphy masterpieces  worth millions of dollars each,  are also letters between friends.  We can make a separate video  later talking about this. Ancient Chinese used writing brushes,  and the speed was much slower  than today's keyboard warriors,  or thumb typing phone users,  so the ancient Chinese language has two systems,  written Chinese and spoken Chinese,  and they are so different that an illiterate could not  understand the articles, proses and poems,  even someone read them to him. Even most Chinese nowadays, with a literacy rate  as high as 95% or even higher,  have to refer to dictionaries constantly  when reading classical books from their forefathers.  And as the literacy rate in the past was very low,  people had to ask knowledgeable intellectuals  to write letters for them,  and when their family members  or friends received the letters,   interpretations were needed  to render the information  in those letters understandable. prompt and accurate communication  is of utmost importance in the military area,  compared to that among civilians.  In ancient China, generals used flags,  drumbeats to direct their armies,  alarms were conveyed to other troops,  and the officials at court,  through smokes of Wolf feces.  in Chinese, those smokes are called Lang Yan,  referring to wars specifically. in modern wars, communication  played an even more important part,  and all involved parties try their best  to exchange messages without being deciphered.  And the advanced weapons,  like missiles and nuclear bombs especially,  need quick and accurate communication,  the Iraqi war in the last century (2003, actually) is a very good example.  Iraq was one of the strongest powers  in the middle east, but it was defeated  by the US just in days.  It was reported that the US army turned off  its GPS signals in the gulf area,  and disturbed the transmission frequencies,  so Iraqi troops became blind and deaf. Because of the Iraqi war, major powers realized  the importance of the Global positioning system.  Europe, Russia, and China all developed  their GPS substitutes respectively,  and China's Bei Dou is the best among all of them.  Apart from the capability to provide  a navigation service to people, vehicles,  ships, missiles, and so on,  it can also enable its users  to exchange real time messages, in remote areas,  where mobile signals are not available.  up to now, Iran has adopted China's Bei Dou  to direct its missiles, so it is no longer like Iraq  when it encounters the US army.  If you are interested, leave your comments below,  we can do some research  and make a video on that topic. in recent years,  China has made great achievements  in communication field, and Hua Wei is  the world's largest telecom company,  providing countless equipment and terminals  to enterprises and end users all over the world.  The reason why Hua Wei was targeted  and its CFO was arrested, is mainly because  the telecom technologies were previously controlled  by Motorola, Cisco, Erisson and Nokia from the west,  a Chinese company with no western secret code  cannot be tolerated.  If most countries embrace Huawei,  intelligence departments will have a hard time  monitoring other national leaders.  A company with no threat to other countries is  the biggest national security threat to certain countries,  so we are pretty sure in the foreseeable future,  Huawei will still have a lot of difficulties to overcome. Thanks to the advancement of technology,  we ordinary people can enjoy  the most convenient life ever in the history.  Instead of waiting in a long queue  to place a call to your beloved,  you can easily talk to her or him  with a press on a phone icon on WeChat.  Your love is only one click away. Maybe one day, we are tired of the convenience,  and would like to have one or two days off,  with no internet, no mobile signal, in a cottage,  far north in a forest, when it rains or snows. The world is suddenly so close to us,  and we occasionally need to be left alone,  for a while, with our our loved ones, or just by ourselves.

brand well honor separated from huawei due to well honor separated from huawei due to the ban issues the ban issues and after separation though honor now and after separation though honor now can use can use google services in its smartphones and google services in its smartphones and now now honor is all set to launch its first honor is all set to launch its first smartphone series smartphone series after being sold by huawei in november after being sold by huawei in november 2020 2020 and bad series called the honor 50. and bad series called the honor 50. here is its first official look and this here is its first official look and this smartphone is the exact same copy of the smartphone is the exact same copy of the upcoming upcoming huawei p50 series which is surprising huawei p50 series which is surprising and great for and great for us at the same time because we get to us at the same time because we get to see the huawei p50 like see the huawei p50 like look a lot earlier here is the official look a lot earlier here is the official look of the huawei p50 look of the huawei p50 and here is the honor 50. it's having and here is the honor 50. it's having four cameras four cameras in two big circles and what is in two big circles and what is presumably the primary camera presumably the primary camera takes up the entire upper circle while takes up the entire upper circle while three smaller sensors and a flash can be three smaller sensors and a flash can be seen located on the circle below seen located on the circle below and obviously i'm showing it because the and obviously i'm showing it because the design is design is very much similar to the upcoming huawei very much similar to the upcoming huawei p50 series phones p50 series phones just the main difference here is the just the main difference here is the location of the main sensor location of the main sensor because the main camera sensor of the because the main camera sensor of the huawei p50 series huawei p50 series is located on the upper side and other is located on the upper side and other three camera sensors are located in three camera sensors are located in circle below circle below and furthermore there are different and furthermore there are different color options in this color options in this phone which further suggests that the phone which further suggests that the huawei p50 might get huawei p50 might get similar color options as the honor 50 similar color options as the honor 50 because i was say despite being separate because i was say despite being separate from from huawei this design similarity between huawei this design similarity between the leading smartphone series of the leading smartphone series of two big brands suggests that the honor two big brands suggests that the honor 50 may have been in development and 50 may have been in development and design design and planning phase much before honor and planning phase much before honor separated separated and become an independent company there and become an independent company there cannot be any other explanations though cannot be any other explanations though since honors sale included all of its since honors sale included all of its assets assets including rnd arm supply chain including rnd arm supply chain and a workforce of more than 7 000 and a workforce of more than 7 000 employees employees so due to no longer being associated so due to no longer being associated with huawei with huawei the us government's restrictions do not the us government's restrictions do not apply to honor smartphones apply to honor smartphones so this smartphone is finally coming so this smartphone is finally coming with google services with google services but the huawei p50 will not have them

explained for me guys it looks very sophisticated and stylish actually you know it's a very eye pleasing and yes i can say that this time guys a very unique system so it's better guys if gaga meeting only bring free jelly case subbox i have to it that makes it feel and look more premium for the first time i might say that this is you know a higher mid-range device yes guys made of plastic it feels very solid and sturdy anyway on the right part we have of course guys young adding volume rocker and below ito young adding power button that doubles as a fingerprint sensor on top we have a secondary microphone on the left of course we have the sim train dual simple and expandable via micro sd card domain and below we have the headphone jack another microphone usb type support and young attend speaker grill side mounted the fingerprint sensor amoled display of course many times in display fingerprint sensor always but most of the time the fingerprint sensor on the side is again guys not going to disappoint it's fast and you know reliable and indeed purpose power button from you know turning on and off the device whether it be tend to wake up the voice assistant now for the display y7a guys i'm around 6.67 interest 2400 by 1080 full hd plus display so display you will be having a borderless experience except for the chin though don't expect langeyes super bright nangwawe y7a outdoor kulang konte in terms of brightness but i can say that the colors are you know very accurate aside guys don't young sophisticated design the sakanyang 6.67 inch full view display is of course the set of cameras we have a 48 megapixels f 1.8 aperture in the main camera and 8 megapixels ultra wide angle lens with 120 degrees field of view a 2 megapixels depth sensor and a 2 megapixels macro lens and for the front camera we have 8 megapixels f 2.0 aperture yes guys makanda young set of cameras to be honest the very pang medrain specs setup well based on my sample photos and of course guys my experience consistent photos especially for now main camera and ultra wide camera it has very accurate colors and the very sharpening images in terms of you know low light photography and ultraviolet dedicated night mode i think first time thank you guys so why seriously 48 megapixels as their main camera for the selfies naman guys again merong atta and eight megapixels consistent in terms of colors but overall guys for the quality of the front camera per dina manasha for an everyday use especially if you are not really taking your you know selfie game seriously now is the cameras guys performance huawei y7a guys it is powered by the kirin 710 gig of internal storage the chipset is also a 40 nanometer processor 78 guys score i 160 812 and if we will be applying it again on real life and on my experience upset nan kirin seven one zero mobile legends and even asphalt 9. they are both playable guys and next of course guys the huawei y7a is running on emui 10.1 based on android 10. as usual guys from a huawei smartphone and the latest and of course huawei how do you download the apps they have their very own huawei app gallery and huawei gallery guys it is already pre-installed dtos y7a or any other huawei smartphone need this app gallery guys by the time max search download applications and for an easier way to download guys apps in the long post app gallery is through petal search widget and petal search widget guys you can download it from the app gallery just search petal search widget and then once in a download you know for the mechanics guys or you can just you know take a screenshot of this qr code and of course guys lastly and charging and huawei y7a guys i'm erong very large 5 000 milliamp hour battery capacity again paired with 22.5 watt huawei super charge on this part guys very competitive y7a is battery life on this device the device lasted me guys for one day and a half and kasama guitar guys of course not gaming of course on camera performance and you know a short video loop test para sa mega b rosco and in terms of charging the man guys i was able to fully charge the device again from 0 to 100 in just about 1 hour and 30 minutes so for my conclusion guys and my initial verdict young lack of google apps devices as a disadvantage because guys huawei app gallery and the search alone can offer halos youtube or gmail actually for the gmail menu email app pero it has a very competitive design and of course the set of cameras again quad camera setup guys very stylish and sophisticated look and feel and some more features like of course the 22.5 watt huawei supercharge multitasking and switching between apps are fine and pretty smooth again 8999 pesos on price now y7a but i think the moment that you are watching this video guys i tapas now pre-orders huawei store website nila or even sawaway official last month or some huawei physical stores that's it guys again it's your turn mary and see you on my next video bye guys [Music] this has to be [Music] the craziest now i i mean you could could have said that a number of times along the way as smartphones got launched you could say this is the craziest look we've ever seen on a flagship i guess crazy keeps changing things keep escalating the smartphone camera crossover accelerates and today we have the huawei p50 to take the cake for maximum overboard camera status now we talked about this device when there were just some rumors about it and they there was like a case that leaked and then like it's kind of these big giant camera units on the back a couple of circles back there but now it's official and while we put out the images themselves they had an event they were mostly in the event talking about harmony os because they're like look we're we're still out here we're scrapping we got an os i mean they didn't use those words it's a big deal for them well i mean i don't man the whole world got flipped upside down for them you imagine going to the drawing board and be like yeah we gotta get this little west going like what does that os have to do oh i don't know compete with google and apple oh whoa those guys yeah those those two scoundrels google an apple yeah we can do that no big deal put together a little os that's just as good and can you convince people like i know you might be looking at me saying hey man take it easy but that my laughter there my chuckling is just in relation to the scope of the challenge the daunting task i mean it is just like it's like mount everest software wise to create a compelling piece of software that you truly think can compete with either of those players at this point now because it's not just the software itself as you know it's the entire app ecosystem that exists on each platform as a consequence of the footprint occupied by each of those two platforms well established and been around forever it's not like huawei has much of a choice but it is it does get to a point where as a tech fan you look at some of this hardware because they were doing some things with hardware that were interesting and you look at hardware like this p50 series and think of it of it what you will as far as being maybe hilario hilariously large for cameras i don't really care i would goof with that right there yeah because this is nice this is very nice i gotta see it in person if like how accentuated it is in this particular photo right but these things are becoming cameras and and every single larger camera module along the way people laughed at for a while until they were like oh that's just what it is now like i got this mock-up over here of the upcoming iphone 13 pro max look at the size of this thing over here now you might look at that and say well i'm sort of used to that because i saw the iphone 12 but like this i'm just reaching i got like all kinds of props over here this was big at the time when apple added the second camera and you saw this and you're like oh cool we got two cameras but unfortunately there's a hump like that was the thing we talked about with this what is this iphone 10. am i right that's an iphone 10. and now you have what the note look at this the note 21 look at this all right people get over it they move on and they go what can the camera do uh image sensor shift technology and uh periscope style folded zoom if you can make the case with the tech people will put up with these larger modules and say you know what sure like i'm looking at the bottom camera there it's a single lens on that unit you can imagine a giant sensor hiding beneath there you can imagine a giant aperture living in that lens like i don't know what the layout is they didn't go into too much detail because they were mostly focused on harmony os 2.0 in this event they just had this tiny teaser and actually the teaser was strange because they were like uh this spring they said something about the spring like this is their new phone for the spring and it's like what timing-wise was it originally planned for the spring had they not had the software issues yes because the spring is obviously coming to an end so and will we will it ever come out will we ever see it are they talking about a year from now it doesn't seem right if the hardware is ready to go so it's all very confusing so this would be the first phone to run harmony os 2.0 i believe up until this point as far as commercially available products they've only been putting this os into their other products outside of smartphones like uh tvs and whatever this ecosystem of external or mate pad is that what it's called the ipad equivalent yeah what is it what is the name of that no it's not called mate pad uh maybe mate tab mate it's got made in it go ahead will tell us what it's called oh yeah matepad pro yeah wow well done well yeah so it looks like jesus looks that looks like a competitor there oh well you're so what you're saying it looks like samsung or apple apple yeah the uh the bar i would like to give it a shot i want to try i mean obviously it's interesting any os in this era we were talking the other day about google's new fuchsia thing developers in the comments were laughing at us they're like you guys don't know what they're talking about and they're right but as from a user perspective which is mostly where we live from an analysis standpoint stuff that we do it is interesting to get your hands on this on this on these alternative platforms to see if there really is a shot to see if anything's happening differently now mostly in android space i wasn't such a huge fan of some of the heavy skins that manufacturers were making and modifications because another part of it is like how many os is in the mobile space can remain natural for you there's enough people that have difficulty just moving cross-platform from ios to android they're just like i'm just that's me that's comfy that's a comfy spot for me i don't want to move over there but here's a situation where it was motivated out of necessity now the other thing to mention is as difficult as it will be to compete with the likes of google and apple outside of china maybe inside china where huawei has had tremendous success maybe that pitch is different when they say hey using all chinese os and hardware from the ground up that they're that that could be compelling to users that are that are local so maybe where they give up some opportunity outside the country maybe they gather it back inside the country yeah but it's gonna be almost a nearly impossible pitch outside of china to for people to purchase this extra os at this point and then wonder if like you know where's my youtube and google services google apps and i heard you can get facebook to work but like it's man will it even work with telecommunications cellular like 4g stuff 5g well that they can figure out on a hardware side that they can figure out but it's it's more whether or not yeah whether or not developers choose to embrace and develop for a brand new platform that may or may not fit well within their business model i mean for a long time we talked about a number of apps that were paying more attention to one platform over the other because it made more economic sense for them and they have limited resources now you say i mean we we saw this happen with blackberry and and blackberry eventually was built on top of android but anywhere we've seen a push to get developers on an extra palm yeah palm os man this stuff feels like a billion years ago and even before that even before ios i i had one of those trio devices even before you had the the later palm operating systems and so it's always been the catch it's like your device is as good as the apps that you can get on it and you can have this is super elaborate hardware and maybe i'll pick one up just to use the camera and that's that but if you can't get all the apps and services that you're used to using or you need to use you're not going to make that compromise carry two phones some people do that i'm not prepared to do such a thing but either way they piqued my interest they're just like more camera it looks like one two three four cameras there and i'm most interested in the one that occupies the bottom camera cutout by itself what you doing over there type of sensor we got we got do we have a one-inch sensor under there because you know we had to store the other day it was sharp who were gonna be the first to put a one-inch sensor into a smartphone okay is that hiding in there huawei send one over whatever we'll talk about it send one over we'll boot up harmony us or whatever you got and talk about it and and shoot some samples or whatever and let me talk about it through the lens of the current state of things it looks great through the lens will will do is a fan so i don't know i don't know what that i don't know what that means i like the design i don't know what time you see huawei it means nothing no remember remember you said that companies like huawei have a soft spot for you said earlier sure whatever you say no you said it i didn't say it you said it i was like why will you like i don't know i can't tell you they just really like me i was like really wow paraphrasing again but yeah today's sponsor freshly dinner time can be chaotic but with

what they spent the majority of their time on they launched harmony os on the flagship mate 40. so here's the details you were looking for so it is it is going to be on the phones mate 40 and mate x2 smartphones official the watch series 3 also gets harmony os so they're creating an ecosystem they're doing they're gonna do the apple thing man that's ambitious and the matepad pro tablet that's the one that you talked about they have of course pivoted after u.s sanctions have hurt their business and made it very hard for them to not only figure out software but even just hardware trading partners because there's been restrictions on that huawei builds harmony os as an operating system that can work across many internet connected devices so that includes smartphones wearables and of course tvs which i i don't know why i recall that was one of the earliest ones they did now there is a benefit to having one os across your devices from the manufacturer of the hardware apple has proven that there's an incentive there because things can sort of work together a little more smoothly then the more open-ended os is like android or windows microsoft where you have a number of different hardware manufacturers building devices for that software it can be a little bit more complicated from a compatibility issue that doesn't mean it's going to be easy to build in the first place but if they can achieve such a thing that will be unique in the marketplace here's a quote from ben wood the chief analyst at ccs insight harmony os is designed to provide the glue between a growing array of connected devices that huawei is targeting huawei is will be hoping that it can follow apple's lead by having a single software platform that extends in all directions providing a seamless experience to customers that buy into its ecosystem of products so will are you saying that huawei is the next apple is that what you just said to me well it would be nice to have a competitor as such you know what i mean where everything is just singular the os hardware yeah so huawei's the next apple signed willy do wow big statement over here uh speaking of apple how's this for a concept phone this now first of all this is absolutely never gonna happen it looks to have drawn some inspiration from that xiaomi device which had the screen on the back and this one looks like it has an even bigger screen you can see first of all they're calling it the iphone 14 it has four camera modules a screen to the right of the camera section and then a screen below that or is it one seamless screen either way the top portion there is looking like it's telling your battery capacity of your connected devices to the phone so you can quickly glance at the phone's battery the watch battery if you have it and headphone battery this video is kind of nicely put together very realistic renders yeah shout out to yanko they do a lot of but is it yanko that did this though or did they just embed it in post oh maybe they just presented it yeah the concept is from the mind of max burjos oh concepts iphone is the youtube channel anyway yeah so yanko's always bringing these type of stories though so shout out to them anyway um like it's not a thing this is like one of those fun dreaming things like oh imagine if they did this but i do like the render quality on that man that's pretty wild we put that together and the screen on the back does have some utility for taking photos with the better camera but there's no way apple's not doing it i'm just gonna tell you right now by the way did that xiaomi device ever show up here with the screen on the back yes it is here i gotta check that out i gotta check that out so yeah while this may never happen how about never say never because cyberpunk and blade runner i mean they all i mean look what the stuff that's supposed to happen never say never cars are supposed to fly at some point yeah hopefully soon it comes in purple so that's nice yeah i don't know about the placement of the apple logo there oh seems a little off yeah you're right but where do you put it maybe you get rid of it like the imac you just say you know what can't fit that one in there how about that for a wild render oh we have one more wild render this one coming via nine to five mac and put together by antonio de rosa and this is a mac pro concept which is maybe a little closer to feasible although still quite avant-garde uh this seems to draw some level of inspiration from earlier macs with that flat front and the the thing that looks like a disc drive but actually in this case is a usb a couple of usb ports and i think an sd card reader possibly it has a handle on it and then on the back is where things get interesting because it looks so slim and trim almost like i don't know two mac minis attached at the hip but then you get this top portion which in this design makes the system modular and these modules would be could be would be storage or gpus or well any variety of things that you might need if you scroll down there's actually a another really cool video clip showcasing how this might work now there's been a rumor for a while that apple was going to do maybe keep the current mac pro form factor for those that want the super traditional tower situation but then rethink a more minimal version considering how powerful the m1 chip is and how it's been received by the community and the fact that there's improvements that are set to come out like people are amazed at what they're doing with the mac mini and you can see the back side that that sort of has a similar look to it and so it's not it's not that crazy to imagine a smaller desktop mac pro but i still don't think it's going to look like this but imagine imagine slotting those modules in like as if they were a game cartridge like a new gpu they got a blow on it first i probably wouldn't recommend it probably wouldn't recommend that um all right last apple related story iphone 13 good news with the iphone 13 we knew it was going to be fatter we knew with the new display technology and supporting pro motion is what apple calls a high refresh and presumably having to fit a battery that can provide similar battery figures performance while compensating for that increased refresh rate you were just like okay it's got to be a bit fatter the phone and then we did the measurements on the model unit that i've had over here did the official measurements on unbox therapy and sure enough even this model is already a bit fatter ever so slightly but the good news is it appears it is going to come alongside better battery capacity bigger battery capacity and we have some figures here courtesy love to dream uh according to this rumor the iphone 13 pro max gets 4 352 milliamp hours compared to the current 3687 on the 12 pro max that's quite an improvement well that's almost a thousand extra milliamp hours we're getting closer to that 5 000. lasts a couple days now here's the other thing they got the new chip the a15 which is apparently more efficient as well yep so maybe you're seeing some banana town battery life but it is important to note it's going to have to deal with this 120 hertz but i'm sure they're going to put some dynamic switching in there that when you're not going to need it it's going to turn it off and they're going to just try to be power efficient about how they give you 120 so i think it's not crazy to say that we may see some of the best iphone battery life ever on the next generation and i like that as opposed to just always having to make things thinner battery life man from day to day that's you use that that's life yeah life in the fast lane man and if it's a little bit thicker for an iphone yeah all right how about the regular 13 pro supposedly that's going to be 3095 which is up from 2815 and then the mini goes to 2406 milliamp hours from 2227. so the biggest improvement obviously is on the pro max model that's likely going to be your battery performer if uh if that's what you're into you might get that two day that uh mysterious coveted foggy two-day battery that we we've all one um imagined we've all i don't know what i'm saying i don't know i don't know how i'm trying to phrase this yeah it's very legendary it's always been actually never mind two day i want one week never mind two day let's not go that far i want one week one week battery it's weird you just get used to it you're just like yeah you charge every day like i've been wearing this watch i charge every day get used to it and that's the target let's just make sure they do it every day yeah they get one day out full 24 hours let's make sure you get one day out of it but i was goofing with that hp that new um elite folio actually the video is not even out yet whatever keep an eye out for it and it's got a snapdragon chip in it even though it's like a convertible laptop thing and they were stating 24 hours of battery life or 20 hours of video watching and then over the weekend i never plugged it in once i was using that at home i never played it in once so this idea is very captivating to me yes and uh i get excited about battery tech and charge tech yeah hopefully they can go with the really fast wireless charging as well and put it all in there yeah well i mean we're not asking for a lot here be nice with it we who was saying that the other day he's nice with it oh it's dave chappelle on rogan's podcast dave chappelle yeah he kept saying you know what he's nice with it he's nice with it yeah i like that that stood out to me as well he kept going there that was his current lingo youtube is introducing a new feature has already introduced for a number of select individuals this is one that i have just wanted for a very long time i don't even know if we talked about on this show before but it's there it's coming out we are talking about the loop button whoa you can finally take a video or song and just wait a sec oh whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa easy on the expressions over there you got a problem with this don't they have this already no they never had that you right click on the video loop is that what are we talking about what are you talking about oh what what is right click loop uh show me right click loop how dare you i mean come on yeah right here okay do it what happens click it well it loops after it's okay go go to the end let's verify this right now it's only gonna loop once it's not going to let you sure what you think it's going to loop indefinitely that's what the loop feature is right okay okay let's do it right now do it live do it right now then oh we have a minute to go but what do you mean a minute oh yeah fast let's do it right now we'll get to the bottom of it once and for all for the people out there so you get to the end of this video i don't doubt that it's gonna loop once but i don't believe it's going to loop indefinitely yep go to the end now oh you know what if this ends up working which we're finding at this captivating moment right here oh look at that what happened there it will loop indefinitely yeah okay so i've never used a feature on desktop but certainly the feature has not been there on the app there's no right click there's no right-click loop so that must be why i'm confused i i've never actually looped on the desktop oh so this is for um mobile yeah for the app oh okay for the youtube app but i know i was curious about the other thing as well which is why i wanted to see if it actually worked which shout out to willy doo for enlightening all of us just just do the right click loop if you're on if you're in chrome but uh actually will even in the youtube music app up until recently the loop function wasn't there depending on the source oh right anyway it's rolling out to more people now uh a proper loop button for mobile the button was first spotted by droid may several days ago but it seemed to be a super limited test it's rolling out to more people now you can see what it looks like there so it's actually hidden inside of the well not hidden but it's inside of the menu that pops up for video quality and other features as opposed to being buried via right click or whatever you have to do on chrome and this is in the app so if you enjoy like a soundtrack or you like uh whatever who shout out uh chilled cow or something like this yeah and you wanna your and you use the app or you use mobile mostly to listen to it now you can have it just continuously play and loop over and this is also useful if you're really into a particular song at a moment when it's a short song and you want it to just play over and over again it's in there and apparently not everybody has it but it's rolling out to even more people yeah here you go it's curious that youtube hadn't implemented it yet on mobile even on the web it already exists it's hidden under the right clickbait so even on the web they don't really want you to do it because it's not in the yeah why wouldn't they put it there if they cared to have you use it it's really interesting i mean they've got loop along with copy debug info and stats for nerds like it's right it goes to show you how much they care about it but really where it needs to be anyway is on the app because that's where you're likely to be listening to music that's where you're more likely to be uh utilizing a feature at least for me yes i agree which is the reason i was shocked when you're like i'm looping over here are you looping well you're looping you're loopy all of the above yeah anyway go ahead go on your mobile app see if the feature is there for you hit the hit the little cog and see what you see uh we have a little bit of a leak here many people were asking about this i think they were asking you about it in the chat the wf-1000xm4 new sony fully wireless earbuds this video came out which looks like an official sony video and it was posted it's still up they didn't even bother to take it down so they're just like all right we're gonna listen we're gonna introduce it soon just let people get a little head start on it they're pretty cool looking they have these like metallic elements on the outside they have they have a pretty uh nice design language going on with the xm stuff like the earbuds kind of feel like the over ears there's like a similarity there now people are excited because they've been so dominant they've delivered some really amazing products in the xm lineup and now of course they're on xm4 as far as the premium earbuds go i think this video leaked in i'm trying to figure out what that language is is that uh dutch or germ no i think it's dutch anyway that must it was it looked like it was going to be a promo video for that particular market and sure enough here we are getting the full exposure the case you can see like even specs five minute charge for 60 minutes of listening i think there's more specs in here too uh it's like a spatial audio feature yeah so listen to this uh industry-leading noise cancellation the earbuds will feature sony's integrated v1 processor new drivers for fuller richer sound support for ldac and high-res audio and dse extreme ai technology to reproduce frequency responses in the original sound source lost during compression it's going to have speak to chat function to automatically pause playback when you start a conversation this was the thing that the samsung buds were attempting to do was a little hit and miss in my experience but it is a cool feature if it works you just start talking and they pause i love it and of course it also has sony's adaptive sound control for adjusting ambient sound so you can really fine-tune external noises versus your music within the app it's not just like a couple of settings it's granular capabilities which is kind of nice uh we'll also have google assistant and alexa support wireless charging ipx4 certification and in total with the charge case 24 hours of playback with active noise cancelling turned on if you turn noise canceling off you can get up to 36 hours of usage with the charge case that's a lot 36 hours it's like a few days well it's impressive of listening now apparently the so the previous iteration was 230 dollars the expectation here is it'll be about 250 bucks so it's not a cheap it's going up against the likes of the airpods pro and things like that it's not a not gonna be an affordable one it's gonna be a premium one tesla's recalling nearly 6 000 cars got some loose bolts on there you don't want that oh oh you don't you don't like those loose bolts you know i got a story actually one time i had had uh i had my car get the tires changed winter tires yeah vin told me this story wait harrowing told you was it him or me that experienced it or did he experience the same thing or he was telling my story he was telling your story oh yeah yeah yeah so i had the tires changed and it was at like a reputable place and i don't know if this just this was many years ago but i don't know if the individual got sidetracked that was working on it or what happened but one of the tires was not very tight like the the bolts they had not been tightened very well and it i drove out and everything felt fine but by the time i hit the main street i it was i i realized something was really off because i was getting you know i knew something was off and so sure enough i get out of the car and the actual many of the lugs are actually just spewing about and the thing was barely hanging on there the tire was just it was just the bolt and it easily if i had it kept going it's coming off i'm crashing ugly ugly sight wouldn't it be a unbox therapy but anyway that's not the manufacture yeah no no i don't think it's been done i don't think i would i don't think that one was gonna take me out permanently but uh that's not from the manufacturer that was just a mishap a one-off at a particular shop i'm sure many people in the comments have had experiences like this it was at that point i started driving trucks and then i never worried about winter tires ever again just get a ford raptor and yeah just get one of those just be done with winter tires yeah changing tires like i do it myself yeah it's um you gotta test it you gotta drive like yeah well actually just to test it after i had that experience i just like i'm just switching to myself the next time around yeah because it's doable just take the afternoon you know yeah it's easy but you gotta do the necessary steps yeah have yourself an iced tea or something is that what you do i don't know i feel like if you're out there changing tires if it's hot yeah maybe i don't know you have an iced tea maybe yeah yeah it's good you're not drinking you don't drink those iced teas do you i'm a fan oh yeah yeah long island or otherwise i went to starbucks today and and the person on uh on the microphone was like uh you said something along the lines of hi there i'm i'm your you reached you reached the right guy for some coffee today or something like that like you know they were just you know how they jazz it up you know how they jazz it up sure yeah and then i knew i was getting an iced tea yeah i just wanted something refreshing i was i already had multiple coffees i was like you know what i'm gonna get this iced tea right now and but what was weird is i i felt the need afterwards because he had pitched a coffee i was like goddamn i gotta he sold you on it well he didn't but i was just like okay now i can't just order the tea i had to add a little put a little precursor is what i did and i said actually you know what it's not gonna be a coffee for me today he's gonna i'm actually gonna go for an iced tea so his energy you try to match it it was just a it was a thing you know yeah it was a thing like that but anyway the iced tea was beautiful okay big iced tea and i don't even get the lemonade in it because they have a whole fancy lemonade situation where you want the lemonade in there any pumps of sugar one in the very in the venti size in the venti size yeah is what i do okay one or zero sometimes oh okay i don't is this the simplest black tea with ice in it it's really what it is it's quite boring actually but it was surprisingly refreshing yes and so that's probably why i had it on my mind when i was like i'm just picturing you switch the tires i'm like man the guy needs a cold drink because it's been hot over there for sure yeah i'll take iced tea so i'll just try and take care of you that's all anyway in the case of tesla these loose bolts i believe are in a brake caliper apparently affected vehicles 2019 to 2021 model 3 vehicles and 2020 to 2021 model y vehicles they want to replace inspect and or tighten the caliper bolts as necessary the caliper bolts allow the brake caliper to separate and contact the wheel rim which could cause a loss of tire pressure in very rare circumstances the company said that in the unlikely event there is vehicle damage from a loose or missing fastener it will arrange for your toe to the nearest service center for repair but of course they'd like to just get the recall done get that sorted out and fixed up so you don't do any further damage now speaking of tesla this next this next article is a video comes from uh a guy that we featured here a long time ago by the name of uh slav popovsky do you remember him yeah he did those cool renders that are super realistic he does these crazy renders tesla related renders and he he does real physics in there so what he did this time around is he did an animation to showcase just how fast that new roadster would be if it truly accelerated in what to 60 and 1.1 seconds with the spacex package so with the jet engine these things are already crazy stupid fast two seconds 0 to 60 is like it's like it takes your breath away man i put my dad in uh i put my dad in the tight can turbo sure with the launch control oh my god that was probably easily the best passenger so far he was just dead he had to breathe oh my god he was like you know i mean i fade up and before i picked him up my sister was like hey man don't don't take it easy take easy on that and i was like but that's part of the most fun of having these type of cars that accelerate like that is you just take out a relative or something and you hit them with the acceleration and you don't announce it right and they get swung in the back of the scene yeah it's a funny reaction every time i should have filmed that man that was ridiculous i should have filmed that anyway this is really cool he used real calculations and he put the standard tesla roadster up against the spacex package to show you how much faster it actually is and it's shocking it means it's almost twice as fast and you'll see in this animation and look how cool these animations are oh yeah look at it go boom see you later i got a jet boost what about you you got the regular roadster who's going to want the regular roadster after that nobody slowpoke and then this represents the quarter mile that you don't even need car wow for the drag race this guy can do it all in physics i think i think yeah they can make like a mars background or something i think people want to see the real thing eventually but this is good for now this is great for now to be able to see this and if the car on the left is pretty much as fast as the other like the plaid and everything else then you just can't even imagine what that feeling is there's a couple of couple of g's in there i'll tell you that shout out slav popovsky keep it up man these are cool 0-60 in 1.1 seconds uh oh amazon is now on board with marijuana legalization they will no longer i didn't even know they did this but they will no longer test their employees for i guess they would do a urine test i don't even know when when they interview you to check for illicit substances well as you know legalization has swept most of north america there's a proposal right now for the federal on the federal level i believe in the united states the marijuana opportunity reinvestment and expungement act of 2021 seeks to legalize marijuana at the federal level anyway i think it's it's still on a state-by-state basis for the time being but of course amazon does business in a tremendous number of states so it would be a bit odd if marijuana was legal and then they're pissed testing you and you're like yeah you didn't get the job or you're fired or whatever it happens to be now apparently there are still the usual restrictions for impairment like if you're just trying to if you're trying to drive the truck and stuff you can't be obviously impaired but if what you're doing on the if you know it sits in your system for a while so if you if on the weekend you were just hanging out around the house and then you got something funny to say what do you got well you want to disrupt me over here i'm sorry it's just uh remember that clip that we did yesterday about the screaming i had to say that that's just in my head like when he's driving away and it's just like ah yeah anyways sorry i had to exactly i had the exact same thought actually i was gonna bring it up after i got through this well yeah it was a very funny clip um i mean i feel sorry for the guy go look for it on later clips it's hilarious it's it's hard to believe actually hopefully he feels better i think he i think he feels better he's got to have a laugh now at his clip going viral i wonder if amazon looks into that like i mean it's easy for them to figure out who it is right because they would know the geography anyway amazon will no longer screen his job applicants for marijuana use and any positions not regulated by the department of transportation uh yeah marijuana is still a classified substance at the federal level but that's that may very well change quite soon amazon also said it's tweaking its worker productivity tracking tool you know they're trying to keep up with the times and getting criticized left right and center on the employment stuff but you just imagine imagine a company at that scale and making decisions everything's massive and slow and trickles down good lower efficiencies being a big companies maybe not as big as amazon but ikea is pretty big they've been doing the thing for a while and they continue to stay relevant and create these collaborations recently they had collaboration with rog on some gaming related gear desks and things like that which i believe we talked about it's just staying with the times man and this is another example of it this actually leaked i don't because they took it off the website i don't think they made the announcement yet but it looks like they teamed up with sonos for a new frame speaker whatever that means the images that were part of the post when it was live on their website make it look kind of like a piece of art almost which also happens to be a speaker and in i don't know i'm kind of curious about what like they you they want you to hang this up or lean it against the wall and not have it have it actually as a feature instead of a speaker that you try to hide or something like that with these designs on it it's like it almost looks like a picture that you put on the wall and of course by teaming up with sonos it's going to be smart you're going to have all your streaming stuff is going to be capable in there all your whatever you use i mean if it's airplay or whatever it is you're going to be capable of interacting in that way they're calling it the simphonisk symphonisk picture frame with wi-fi speaker it was listed at 199 even though it hasn't been announced and the post is now down the picture frame measures 22 inches high 16 inches wide and two inches deep customers can choose between various interchangeable fronts so you can change the appearance of it and the frame would be offered in either black or white finishes designed to blend into your home decor not stick out as an obvious tech gadget so it looks like a piece of art on the wall stylish but it's also your speaker what do you think about this will yeah i i do like it um man i wish they could hide the plug but there's no way around that right like in the wall or something but yeah you could i mean if you wanted to yeah as it like i mean like when you mount a tv or something you want to hide the cable yeah you could do it you can definitely do it but if you you get the white one and you happen to have a white wall yeah i can really see it that much uh shadows all right so your po so put a hole in the wall sure yeah feed it through call it a day yeah there's no way around it uh you know it's it's a it's a good idea i would say the frame i mean your your other option is to put the power outlet since that's all you need you can have the power outlet at the height of the speaker yeah there you go like just have it installed some people do that when they mount a tv as well anyway it's been removed from the website you're gonna have to wait to see more details because i guess they didn't want it to be out yet google assistant is getting a new look and i think this is a key because you and i have talked on many occasions about how we believe that some component in the in the future maybe even a major one is going to be just voice based interaction we believe i'm speaking on your behalf and i'm acting like it's some kind of innovative belief no everyone knows this yeah that you've seen her it's like that man somebody needs to make a meme out of that because that's been too many times now it needs to be you and it just says have you seen her because 17 times now you've asked me to see a movie that i haven't seen and probably will never see because i don't see anything sure yeah anyway so one of the one of the problems you interact with google assistant and maybe maybe one of the ways you do this is in the car because that's one of the one of the times that i feel really compelled to use voice instead of any other input because you're driving but one of the problems is that the interface is kind of designed for typical phone range which as you know you know that's like it's like right here but in a car you may have it over here and so what they did is they got rid of the speech bubbles when you're interacting with assistant you see the little speech bubbles in the regular sized text font and they made it way bigger and bold so now and and then the current interaction becomes the biggest one and highlighted so it's kind of like accentuated uh better contrast as well way better contrast so i'm a big google assistant guy and i'm actually i look at it now and i'm surprised that it wasn't always like that because of it seems so obvious for a voice based interaction to amplify all that stuff but there's still a ways to go and i mean eventually if it's if it's really good then there's no need for the screen at all because your trust level with interaction and the feedback is rich yeah it's just like there you go okay scarlett johansson all right is that who was sir responding is that who her was her her was scarlett johansson and you know what um there was no interview with her pre-movie launch just to kind of let people get into the like ambiance of like her being an ai oh so she did no promotion any promotions or interviews interesting yeah that's a good move yeah smart maybe i should see this movie you should all right sticking with google for a second here's a sneak peek inside their brand new store there's no surprises here they pretty much did exactly what you would expect them to do oh it's up already well i don't believe it's open to go in but everything is set up inside oh i felt like we were talking about them making a store like well the thing was it's on the ground floor of the building that they're already in so maybe it's not that big of a deal they go move a few things around like store there you go no i'm sure it's a big deal i'm just kidding but anyway through the windows you can get a sense for the style of what they're going for and it's like i said it's no surprise you got the light wood color on many of the fixtures which is very google very apple very tech very san francisco whatever i don't know what what you would call it and you can see the product layout so i see one of those nest hubs i see all the phones laid out on a table as well as the cases and other accessories prominently featured shelves full of accessories stadia is represented with the controllers and the phone and so this is kind of your best look for the time being there's a couple of stools in there what's your takeaway there's got a theater in there as well i think you have to scroll down a little further for that you'll see that there's a big screen and some some of those little cube chairs you can move around maybe they'll do presentations there i think you got to scroll a bit further yeah they really have that like room environment they want to make you feel at home or something there you go that's a that's the image i was talking about right there so i guess they can have you know meeting or presentation i don't know if they want to do classes how apple does everyone's trying to figure it out but it does i mean if we're being honest here which of course we are it's the only way to do the show it feels kind of apple inspired to me but i don't know how else you do retail like i don't what do you do in there you got to make it feel comfortable and you got to make it it can't it has to be somewhat minimal because you're showcasing products at the end of the day so but it's pretty much exactly what you would have expected it to look like that's how i would yeah that's that's essentially how i would describe it it's really down to a science yeah so there's not too many risks involved over there oh this next one i gotta give a shout out will this company spyra so a while back and you claim to know nothing about it but a while back this company sent us what at the time they were referring to as the greatest water gun of ever of all time period water gun yes water gun and the box was sitting there for a little while and i didn't know what it was and we just get so many products so i got to apologize to the company because i never saw it but my kids got their hands on it and this thing is cool actually what we had was a kit with two of the original spira guns in it and this is a powered water gun which you fill up from the front nozzle in any bucket or pool you just it has a pump in it and it fills up the entire chamber then you have this kind of like rapid fire but it's powered so there's no pumping no nothing or you can hold the trigger and it will create like a super shot so it will do three shots in one or like and you'll see the meter going down as it's filling up and then you'll release and it'll be like a mini hose for a second so i gotta give a shout out go check out spirit cause i never it never made it on unbox therapy and uh and it is actually as cool as they were saying it was in the kickstarter oh okay now the spyro one it was uh it had the gauge on it digital ammo gauge it had a self-pressurizing tank and a battery that you charge over usb type c as well and you can see how easy it is to fill that's the biggest trouble with water guns yes it's constantly filling it up this one you just poke it into any water source and blam you're firing now the spirit two now by the way it's not cheap i should tell you this right now the original one was 133 i think the new one is like 150. so it's not cheap but it is a lot of fun the new one is going to be yeah 159 and it will be an even bigger blast it will shoot 46 feet aiming at a 45 degree angle and i i'm telling you will if i hit you with that in the leg you're gonna feel it at a particular range i'm gonna pop oh you're gonna feel it i might have to bring it in that's the that's the spiral one but they got this number two coming out cool and they improved pretty much every aspect of it so if you scroll down you'll see a comparison chart from one to from the first one to the second one actually i think you went past it up there a little bit more yeah i noticed that it had a digital gauge percentage of the water yes yes so that's kind of cool it will tell you how many blasts you have now i noticed the capacity went down a little bit so spyro 1 was 25 blasts spyro 2 is 20 blasts the priming speed this is big between shots goes down to 1.1 seconds from 1.5 the range goes up to 30 feet from 25 or with the boost mode a maximum range of 46 from 40. so a six foot improvement a faster refill 12 seconds instead of 14 the blast size remains the same the tank size go down goes down that's why your blasts go down i presume they did this because of weight it's a pretty big it's a pretty big device at the moment the battery life also saw an improvement so maybe they put some extra room in there for battery and it's another thing you have to monitor on a full charge how many blasts do you get [Music] and on the new one it's up to 000 individual blasts from 11 25 so they saw an improvement over there as well it's gonna cost 159 man with the summer time and the water fight i don't know if you want to get it as a gift i don't even know they might be sold out right now but my kids were having an absolute blast with the first one nice so i just want to say thank you to them for sending that over because maybe i'll bring it i'll bring it on this show actually as well okay i'll snag one of them back and i'll i'll bring it on this show and i'll show you all right and you can feel you can feel it let me know if it's powerful or not shoot my leg yeah that's right we have our latest viral a tick talk sensation which is now the mystery thing all over again but remember when the mystery thing was before it was like behind this wall is oh i don't even know what's behind the wall in this house i live in your rendition of this person here is quite hilarious oh my god you won't believe what i found so the original one somebody found a hole behind a mirror in the wall and they climbed through it and they're like what is this in my apartment and then there's another version of it which was like i bought this old house and there's this boarded up room do i go up there stay tuned like this video share this video to find out more there's so many little tricks and tools on tech talk that feel like things that happened on youtube a thousand years ago and they're getting like repurposed like scary videos or prank videos they got a whole new whether they it's like they all happened and then they happen again for a new generation yeah new medium new generation like i said it's like reborn like vine every trick everybody pulled on vine and i just now it's on anyway the new one is a girl who was in a hotel room and showcased a a way in which people can br can break into hotel rooms okay and shared a story about her own personal experience with this style of break-in she was in the shower at the hotel it has all your like spooky aspects to it maybe spooky's the wrong word because this is just like real humans criminal behavior you can play the clip is there a song probably i imagine how take talk works is she gonna be talking though we don't need to hear it you see the caption so look at the hanger comes out and apparently this is if if you're on vacation or something some people will do this activity to try to get into the room and just like pull down on now in her personal circumstance she's in the shower comes out in the towel and there's two dudes there oh that had you this happened for real yeah in her rendition and she's sharing this video to encourage people to use the deadbolt lock at the hotel you know the oneness above the more the more secure lock that obviously this trick wouldn't work for anyway she says you gotta like stay tuned for part two and then part it's always a part one two seven and then blow up it seems that's the trick you want the thing to go viral you you you it's a cliffhanger yeah and it's seven different clips to tell a very short story part two is usually like oh my god i can't believe it blew up and thank you for your support now on to part two yeah exactly exactly so but uh in this case people are doubting her and saying she's lying it actually took a weird turn but uh i suppose it's true i guess people just didn't think that this would be possible but of course why wouldn't this be possible in a hotel and the thing is when you're out of the room like let's say you're at a resort and you're at the beach at a pool or something the deadbolt is not locked right and or the chain lock or whatever you have is not locked so that presumably this trick would work every time although maybe there's some smarter locks out there electronic ones that are locked from both sides when the card no because then you could get locked in the room yeah i guess that trick always works i guess it does anyway the hilton hotel that she referenced she was staying and hilton the company actually reached out to her really as well they're like how you doing what happened at this hotel because they want to get to the bottom it would be criminal activity right anyway yeah uh they got 12 million views if you want to hit it big on tick tock tell a scary or mysterious story over multiple uploads that's how you win tick-tock please do that the krispy kreme story remember they were giving away free donuts and you love this story uh yeah yeah i think so well there's also a negative component to it because if you get if you eat krispy kreme donuts every day it's not good and having the freedom to do so that's you know i'm just playing both sides as i do sometimes do you think one krispy kreme a day is really that bad if every what if everything else you eat is crazy healthy and then you just have one krispy kreme a day well yeah i mean that's fine and then it's just broccoli after that for the rest of the day anyway krispy kreme did this thing where they're trying to encourage people to get vaccinated so they're giving away free donuts and you kept asking me are they still doing that you kept asking me how much is it in canada it is in canada and they are still doing it and and the question you had every time was wait how many donuts yeah well then you just go to another krispy kreme so they've given away 1.5 million donuts so far and they and they're still they're still going they're still doing it and they've upped the ante even further because they're having a day here national donut day is friday so we're going to put you're going to we're going to pick some up or something i don't know uh you don't go past there anymore so maybe it's not going to be krispy kreme we have to get tim horton's donuts or something sure it's not the same level tim horton's stepping game up all right krispy kreme we all know what they're doing with those donuts is magic we all know it anyway it's national donut day on friday and so if you have your vaccine and you go in on friday now you're getting two free donuts instead of one [Music] they say you double it up right and if you don't have the vaccine and you just want one free donut well friday's your day oh so you get because on national donut day they're giving away free donuts so krispy kreme this is this must have been very beneficial for them i'm guessing what end up ended up happening is their sales went up because people went in there for the free donut and they bought a coffee and they bought a few or they bought some donuts for their family or whatever they they uh it must have worked out because they're still talking about it and they're amping it up even further it's been going on since march 22nd our fave day your fave deal both will be back this national donut day friday june 4th come in for a free donut of your choice us and canada shops friday 6'4 only while supplies last so you could pile that one up look at that image right look at that picture stop it man when they come across on a conveyor like that with the with the the icing which is like fully encapsulates the donut they're plump yeah and they start to brown up and plump up a little bit as they float past but it's some there's something about that thin icing though you can still see the donut in there that glaze over there yeah wow i don't know if you understand will i do thoroughly that's great it's a beautiful sight all right so donut day on friday uh okay couple of youtube trending related stories uh audio music so we were talking yesterday about jake paul versus tyron woodley but almost it's it's funny because that fight got announced and i this whole it's all very calculated with the timing and stuff yesterday we can talk about that but really the more impending thing here is the logan paul fight the floyd fight i didn't even realize how close it was yeah this sunday this sunday yep so did they do enough promotion or have i just no they didn't no because i'm feeling like i'm sure they're gonna make plenty of money but i can't help it because you know when mcgregor and mayweather fought yes they did the world tour i was there at uh where was it molson budweiser's stage whatever they call it it's had so many names in the course of my life down there near the exhibition uh oh no near ontario place anyway you had mcgregor and mayweather i was right there at the front row when they were going back and forth it was hilarious but they and that promotion may have been too big because i think they got pretty wiped out traveling to different countries but man it worked they put they put a lot of money down that thing but then again so did the jake paul been asking people are just bored right now people are looking for any content to wake them up seems worth watching or whatever but you have a weird day it's a sunday and it crept up so that's why i was asking but they only did the one real in-person thing that i can recall but either way whatever they'll sell it doesn't matter but we have a a video on trending this is from logan paul's main channel promoting the fight this should do this should help because here you have three and a half million views here you have number nine on trending right now and the question is will and and and you're gonna watch a little bit of this clip you can just scroll forward maybe halfway are you does this look good to you are you impressed with this training or have you already seen this clip i i saw the video okay um i was more concentrating on the actual edit interesting and that was good i like the edit so but uh i mean the training it's all this is all promo it doesn't it's not like a workout session there's no sparring but he's hitting the bag sure he's sweating yeah he's there's very he's never wearing a shirt yeah in the whole thing there's a lot of skipping and air punching hey man hey man no nothing wrong with that hitting the heavy bag too oh it's a good promo video i would i would say well no because you kind of just said the opposite you guys were just like well there's no real there's no take away here you're like it was a nice edit but i'm hyped up you were like you're like there's a lot of air punching i i thought what you meant to say was like you know to see his skills in action well no actually i don't see it in this video where i was going was did this video do anything for you as far as believing that he has any kind of chance that's that was my question he has a puncher's chance okay so that's a way of saying no yeah all right i was just cause because really that's the goal here right if you want people to buy it they have to believe he has a chance now everybody any everybody and anybody has a chance so i hear you on that standpoint but the goal of a clip like this is to convince people that anything can happen right yeah but you're saying didn't do it for you no okay i was just concentrating on the edit apparently yeah and the air punching yeah anyway it's on trending a lot of people watched it so uh 260 000 thumbs up i think they're gonna sell a few of these things anyway whatever they don't they don't they don't need willy dude's money although they might get it anyway all right last one of the day and uh since i was on trending looking around the logan paul one was the easy one to pick but then i bumped into this absolute gem right here okay and this is my first exposure to grupo fermi hablemos official video this was this is also on trending number 25. it's got like 1.1 million views and this is a music group that i had not encountered previously and this whole video and this whole song and i don't like to say this but i don't have another way to phrase it it's a vibe and i didn't want to say that because you know it gets overused but this made me feel away this put me at ease this gave me hope this made me this was it was an absolute look at the outfit over here well just one time i want you to show up to this show with that shirt just one time with the lion and the flowers oh okay and every guy in this video is it's a group of guys around you but just play a little bit play a little bit with the audio play a little bit with the audio please tiny bit right here oh my goodness he takes a drink he's got the michelob ultra play a little play a little bit more will yes yes there's a there's some kind of tuba in the background they got a tuba and a full group of guys standing around the pool and he's got this outfit over here and he's feeling it emotionally and they got a cooler full of michelob ultra i hope they got a few i hope they got a few dollars from that but it is so casual i feel like you know i'm a fly on the wall there's no walls out there because you're around the pool but i feel like i could encounter such a thing and just fully become engulfed in the entire atmosphere they've created an atmosphere here it's no fancy effects or like crazy type of uh uh music video you know how music videos it gets over the top and and they try to make it as uh flashy as possible there's no flash here they set up and the only thing that's flashes the outfit but i feel like this guy can pull that outfit in real life he might show up to the grocery store in that outfit that's how comfy he looks in that outfit are those uh batman sandals i think he's probably some type of designer sandal will how dare you looks like that let us hear a little bit of it will come on we can't hear like 20 seconds please come on man you got it [Applause] [Music] oh my goodness crazy these people you don't know you gotta play go a little bit more a little bit more please [Music] yes yes okay we got it we got it we got we got it we got it see i just needed you to hear the voice will and i don't know if we're gonna get the copyright on it but like this is i'm promoting i'm promoting a song so don't give me the copyright on it i'm saying every so often for every tick-tock for every uh exposure that gives you just some sort of pit in your stomach every click you wish you had back every dark moment every hole every vortex every all those times you feel uh you you you find yourself at the end of an empty click or worse than an empty click a negative click where you were like is that what it is now is that where we're at now is that 2021 now yeah and then every so often there's a surprise you bump into a hablamos like this yeah and i had a moment over there i was sitting there reading the news and i had a moment over there you closed your eyes and felt the breeze you don't know what i did i reached up to the keyboard where the volume was and i tapped it twice to the upper direction oh that's rare so i just want to thank them for that for putting together that entire mood right there and and and and i would like to say it vibe mood all these things you better save that terminology when you need it don't say that everything is that don't tell me that some just like one lazy meme gets that same description is this right here because what they put together over there that's what deserves it [Music] well there it is you have a wild card do you no i don't okay all right we good you welcome to redacted tonight this is the comedy show where americans in america covering american news are called foreign agents tonight let's turn to one of the news stories lost in the madness of our governmental chaos and that story is the secret reason our government is at war with huawei one of the biggest technology manufacturers in the world if you haven't heard of huawei it's been attacked endlessly in american media but until now i didn't pay that much attention to it i'm i'm sorry i had other [ __ ] to do like watch the recent boxing match involving an elderly mike tyson why is it that when an athlete is just barely past their prime we [ __ ] hate them we're yelling at the tv screen get off the field you're losing you're 38 years old get your astro retirement home where you belong or when mike tyson was like 40 years old and getting his face kicked in we uh we were angry at him right for even just trying we were like you jerk i didn't tune in to see a rapist lose in the first 30 seconds i tuned in to see a rapist bite off the ear of another guy i want my money back so we hate past their prime athletes until they're way past their prime then when like when they're in their 60s we love them again we'd rather pay to see john mcenroe play jimmy connors today for a charity match in which they both have arthritis and conor's can only return balls hit to his left side because his right leg doesn't go forward anymore we'd rather watch that than watch two like bosnian teenagers who are the best tennis players in the world we're like [ __ ] up bring out what's left of billie jean king's body where's grandpa tyson let's see if he can knock out an 80 year old who used to work at the local car wash point being when it comes to huawei i haven't cared that much i figured it was just part of trump's insane trade war and i didn't look into it i have never owned a huawei product uh that i know of i'm not chinese that i know of although my mother does get a little cagey when i ask why i like egg rolls so much but then again i like anything rolled up egg rolls crepes blondes sushi you name it anyway the massive corporation huawei has been enemy number one for trump but also for most of our liberal media our right-wing media our media all of the media a real disaster is looming and it comes from chinese tech company huawei so huawei dan is facing sort of a list of charges she has been called a pawn and a bargaining chip even the face of the u.s china trade war and the u.s has accused her of fraud the u.s unveiled sweeping charges against chinese tech giant huawei on monday 23 charges and two indictments were unsealed yesterday so you're saying you're a fan that's right the u.s government even arrested one of huawei's executives in canada for supposedly supposedly going around our sanctions on iran which is like saying listen we hate this other country for no reason and we have said we are not talking to them they can talk to the hand therefore you have to give them the hand too if not we'll arrest you so why is huawei attacked more by the american ruling class than just about every other corporation i finally decided to dig into this a little so i took a jaunt over to neoliberal propaganda source wikipedia motto we rewrite history so the american government doesn't have to wikipedia said huawei is a chinese multinational technology company it designs develops and sells telecommunications equipment and consumer electronics that all sounds pretty true i'd like to commend wikipedia's editors for refraining from typing any racial epithets in all caps in the opening sentence of that entry they kept all the epithets for the footnotes which i'd call that downright polite wikipedia then uh let me know that huawei has become the largest telecommunications equipment manufacturer in the world and as of july 2020 they surpassed both samsung and apple to become the top smartphone brand in the world so is that why we hate them because they're winning well that's part of it but samsung is winning too and we aren't grabbing their executives in airport lounges and giving them cavity searches i mean we are but it's mainly for fun you know pleasure not business the real reason huawei is so dangerous is because it's winning and wait for it it's owned by its workers that's right here's from their website huawei is wholly owned by its employees with ninety six thousand seven hundred sixty eight shareholding employees ren zing fey the founder and head of huawei only owns one percent of the shares compare that to amazon where jeff bezos owns 10 percent of the shares and the vast majority of the workers own zero they have no say in the operation of the company and the vast majority of the other 90 of amazon shares are owned by rich dickholes huawei goes on to say on their website no third party controls huawei and look i'm not in the business of doing propaganda for china so i won't claim that this corporation is doing the angels work or that there aren't any shitty business practices just like american corporations i mean i imagine the conflict minerals in huawei phones were probably mined by six-year-olds wearing dirty power ranger t-shirts getting paid in m ms just like our american phones i doubt it's much different but if the fact that huawei is owned by its workers is even remotely true which it is then it's a huge threat to the american corporatocracy it undermines every patriotic piece of [ __ ] we're sold about how we're supposed to enthusiastically inhale the exhaust from amazon trucks in order to live up to our full potential as americans and now getting paid less than the cost of a bag of doritos per hour is a king's ransom compared to all other countries the fact that huawei is worker-owned also goes against the us and western media propaganda that huawei is a dastardly chinese government plot whenever the new york times or the wall street journal or what have you poops out an article about huawei they throw in terms like complicated the complicated corporate structure it's really not that complicated it's certainly not more complicated than u.s corporate structure that looks like a [ __ ] mcs or painting so they can avoid paying taxes in america yeah yeah on paper we're owned entirely by a guy in ireland who cleans toilets at an elementary school but we've never actually told him that he owns the company and the money doesn't go to him it gets rooted through a paper mill in caracas then on to an s m sex dungeon and paris and then to a holding company in the cayman islands it's really quite simple our media also love to point out that the founder of huawei who only has one percent stake is former chinese military in western media they say that fact in this tone mr zhang fei is former chinese military blah [Music] and then blood and snakes and snot and leeches pour out of their mouths as they say meanwhile whenever someone in the u.s corporate world is former u.s military they are introduced as his former military how awesome is that maybe we can all suck on him right now so we can get some of that sweet sweet patriotism you see the difference furthermore these u.s media propaganda pieces make the average reader think oh my god he's he's he's former chinese military how dare a corporation be connected to the country's military yes exactly large corporations like amazon google ibm they have no connections to u.s military they would sooner eat their hats than be connected to the most murderous military on earth i dare say oh except they're totally connected to our military and our c.i.a in fact just the other day i reported how the cia announced secretive technology contracts worth tens of billions of dollars with amazon google ibm oracle and others and these are just some of the massive contracts that link google amazon etc with our military so let me see if i have this straight when corporations align with the largest mass murderer machine ever created they're doing awesome raking in billions while doing their patriotic duty but when a corporation's founder is former military in china he's a james bond villain who shoots children in their sleep and has gold-plated teeth and probably a villainous catchphrase like we wouldn't want that no would we so the true reason huawei is so [ __ ] dangerous to the american corporatocracy is because it is worker owned it is the threat of the good example if american workers suddenly realize that one of the most successful companies in the world is worker owned then they may want the same they may not want to be on the bottom rung of a totalitarian ladder of abuse you see we don't talk about it that much but u.s corporations are set up in a fully totalitarian structure there's no election by the workers there's no control to the workers and as economist richard wolf has said if a company is owned by the workers then they wouldn't vote for their jobs to be outsourced they wouldn't vote for their pay to be cut or their lives to be ruined by the company they wouldn't vote for their health care to suck balls they wouldn't vote to pollute their community so much that that all their kids come out with three eyeballs and the iq of a bucket of soapy water they also wouldn't vote for amazon robots to zap them in the ass with a taser every time they go too slow and there are some worker co-ops in the u.s the largest one is cooperative home care associates which has 2300 workers who enjoy good wages regular hours and family health insurance basically having worker ownership of companies is the answer to a ton of our problems it's not the answer to all of them obviously huawei still produces millions of phones that are then thrown away each year totally destroying the planet just like our phone producers so having worker ownership in a market economy will not save the world but it would help a lot of people and once the workers have that power and that success they may use that power to have some control in the government and actually change things for the better but we wouldn't want that no would we much better to get paid in bathroom breaks and have a gofundme retirement plan coming to you from washington d.c the belly the beast this is redacted tonight you [Music] so [Music] so [Music] this [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] so [Music]

hongshin a chinese semiconductor and chip manufacturing company with a total planned investment of more than 15 billion us dollars officially announced its bankruptcy and laid off 240 employees the project was the largest chip manufacturing project in china twice the size of the new york listed smic it was launched in november 2017 and was once seen as the future and hope of china's chip industry but it fell apart in just four years it all began in 2018 when the u.s china trade conflict started the u.s gradually included select chinese companies such as huawei in its economic sanctions list forcing them into a shortage of chip supply take huawei as an example on september 15 of 2020 the us government banned chips made of u.s technologies from selling to huawei facing supply shortage it was once rumored huawei had to invest in pig farming in china just to maintain its capital flow in order to get more chips chinese communist party leader xi jinping proposed to launch a new statewide system in technological innovation and research the national development and reform commission has announced to invest 9.5 trillion yen in chip research and development with the same priority as building atomic bombs in the past years china's plan was to achieve the goal of 70 chip self-sufficiency by 2025 which means the central government will give great loans and national policy subsidies to those who joined the chip manufacturing industry with such support promised the whole country has joined the huge movement to manufacturing chips wuhan hongsoon was established under such a background however if we take a closer look at its development history we may find out that a big scam could be involved setting up a chip project is never an easy task it requires high-end technical talents and specific production equipment a stable material supply chain as well as vast land to build factories each part involves huge capital and could not be established unless all the conditions are met however the founder of the wuhan hong shin project is an ordinary chinese man with no assets no related background in the chip industry in an elementary school diploma his name is taoshan which according to mainland media could be a false name in 2017 taoshan seized the opportunity after knowing the national policy support for the chip industry and the intention of the chinese local government to launch chip projects for the sake of political performance he traveled to various provinces to lobby local governments for partners in order to brand himself zhao often carried several business cards with them pretending to be the taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company or tsmc's vice president he also pretended to be acer's first vice president in new york of course all those identities were fake however using his silver tongue he has gained the trust of the government and some key personnel in the industry in 2017 tal met a person named long way who later became the mastermind behind hong shin to facilitate cooperation with the local government they needed to register a company therefore long found a close friend by the name of li xian to help ironically lee had sold wine open hotels but has zero experience with chips so this is how an absurd management team was formed long way who had connections as the chairman zhao shan the opportunist as the director and lee yen the chip nerd was appointed as a second director and general manager and none of them has any experience in the chip industry surprisingly hong shin quickly gained momentum and later taoshan established another company named beijing light blueprint with that holding 90 percent of the shares the wuhan homsing chip company was established in a joint venture was the wuhan dong xihu district government beijing light blueprint then promised to invest 1.8 billion yen at that time which was never actually paid when the wuhan hong shin project first launched it said it would focus on 14 nanometer chips and a year later it would make seven nanometer chips with a production capacity of 30 000 pieces per month at present only tsmc and samsung have mass production capabilities for seven nanometer chips an smic which is supposed to represent the most advanced level of chip production in mainland china can only mass produce 14 nanometer chips in 2018 hong shin has been listed as a major local project of hubei province for two consecutive years externally hong shin has introduced itself as a 20 billion usd investment project and launched two phases of plant construction in 2018 and 2019 with a total investment of 52 billion yuan and 76 billion respectively meanwhile the dongxihu district government eager to see results quickly has also given strong support to wuhan hong sin documents released by wuhan development and reform commission show that in january 2019 6.5 billion of investment had been completed by the district government in march 2019 hong shin got more than 1.5 billion yen of investment in one month wuhan hong sin took another step in 2019 it appointed tsmc's former ceo sangi chang as the project's general manager chang was the most valued technical expert in tsmc and was known as the global chip industry's most popular figure at the same time he also posed more than 100 experienced engineers and managers from tsmc and other taiwan chip companies to hong xin at three to four times the salary moreover through senior chang's previous relationship with asml the world leading dutch chip maker hong shin acquired the first duv lithography machine in china from asml at a price of 800 million in december 2019 at that time wuhan hongshin was standing at its peak declaring to repay the nation with chips but it was also hong sin that staged the most disastrous incident in the history of the chinese chip industry in 2020 on july 30th 2020 a document released by wuhan officials first mentioned that the wuhan hongshin chip project has a large funding gap and is at risk of project stagnation due to a break in the funding chain this document was deleted soon after however with more and more people inquiring on august 28th wuhan city dongxihoo district officials admitted that after investigation the wuhan home chip project has been suspended due to broken capital chain in fact as early as the end of 2019 wuhan huangyu foundation engineering took wuhan hongshin to court and applied for account freeze and seizure of other properties due to the default of 41 million in project payments and in november of 2019 more than 50 acre of land use rights of wuhan hongshin were seized for a period of three years moreover on january 20th 2020 honshi mortgaged its only brand new and unused lithography machine to wuhan rural commercial bank for a loan of 580 million yen by that time homestead lost its key equipment and suffered a broken capital chain sami chang was disheartened and resigned from hong king in june 2020 in an interview with hong kong's south china morning post he recalled his experience at hong sin as a total nightmare chang's departure became the last straw that broke the camel's back in november 2020 wuhan don xihu district completely took over hongshin by acquiring its 90 stake in the company the project's engineering contractor is still working to repay hong shin's 40 million yen debt so where did all the money go according to an investigation by the mainland media public information shows that the project's large revenues expenditures and arrear statistics simply do not add up and about 12.4 billion yen is missing it was also found that hong xin had complicated tied up interests with a number of other companies which in turn had intricate ties with the three founders of the project according to a former employee long way once confessed the truth after getting drunk he said he was only earning 10 to 20 000 yen a month and if he wanted to achieve his retirement goal of making 100 million he'll have to take it out of hongshin according to the sky eye early in may 2019 long way and taoshan quit the management of the company after leaving hong shin taoshan bragged to those around him saying taiwanese people meaning chang are so easy to fool this is just a game and he's just here to take over the mess moreover taoshan continued to move around and replicate the chip scam all over china since november 2018 tao has set up more projects including zhuhai yi sin yunxin international hubei tianshin jinan chenshin etc even after hong shin's crackdown tao is still making hundreds of millions of dollars out of these projects after all the chip scams have a lot to do with the current system in china with the tilted national level policy and huge subsidies coupled with the local government and the excessive pursuit of chips many real estate companies cement companies and other unrelated companies are all joining the chip business looking for opportunities to make big money according to statistics in 2019 alone the country added more than 10 000 new chip enterprises in 2020 the annual number of newly registered chip enterprises went up to 22 800 an increase of 195 percent in just the first two months of 2021 new registrations have reached 4 350 a year-on-year increase of 378 percent as of today there are 66 500 chip related enterprises in mainland china in addition even if these enterprises are revealed to be scams the local governments that funded them could only endure the losses silently in order to save face the low cost and low risk of cheating has given rise to a number of similar enterprises forming a vicious cycle in may 2020 the proposed 10 billion usd chip manufacturing plant chengdu gosin was officially shut down the project lasted only two years in july 2020 nanjing doko a chip project was an initial 3 billion usd investment was reduced to a triple unpaid company with unpaid wages unpaid payments and unpaid taxes and is now in bankruptcy and liquidation wuhan hongshin is only a fragment of china's big chip making scam and more and more similar stories are coming to the surface it makes people wonder how far can a country go when their companies are like this [Music] [Music] videos [Music] foreign plastic [Music] [Music] um foreign foreign [Music] 2.0 [Music] [Applause] hello [Music] keep [Music] [Music] foreign download foreign foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] um we have a huawei p30 light cook the huawei huawei's done cooking probably into the back open it up remove the back glass that's the huawei beautiful unscrew remove disconnect the battery remove the logic board transfer all the little parts so the battery actually comes with removal instructions thank you huawei well that was really easy and satisfying unscrew rim oh remove remove audio jack now we have to put it all back together that's our new screen charging port battery logic board and i was sent the wrong frame or maybe i ordered the wrong frame i'm not sure but the back camera won't fit so they sent me the wrong frame but i'm getting another one tomorrow the founder of Huawei has said there is no way the u.s. can crush the company now on BBC World News rung Zhang Fei speaks exclusively to charisma for swanee in his first international interview since the arrest of his daughter the company's chief financial officer it's one of the world's leading telecommunications companies with annual sales last year in excess of a hundred billion dollars but now its founder run Jung PHA is facing the Battle of his life as China and the US face off in an increasingly ugly trade war Huawei finds itself at the center of the storm according to the indictment in 2012 Huawei began a concerted effort to steal information about a robot that t-mobile used to test mobile phones the United States is pressuring its allies to shun Huawei's products claiming that the company is an arm of the Chinese government but for mr. run this is also a personal fight his daughter has been arrested in Canada and is facing extradition to a US Court talking exclusively to the BBC run junghae claims the u.s. actions are politically motivated Buchan there's no way they can crush us the u.s. is constantly hurling accusations against us finding fault with us but this pushes us to make our products better try to go home Huawei success has become the prism through which the US and its allies are viewing China's rise at the core of this is a simple but critical question is Huawei truly an international company operating on the global stage or is it very much a product of the Chinese Communist system founder run Jeong Fei tackles this question and others in this special edition of Asia's tech Titans [Music] Ranjan fee has only ever wanted one thing to build a global company in China that could rival the best in the world and that is exactly what he's done mister run started Huawei with just three staff and two and a half thousand dollars in Shenzhen one of China's special economic zones when I first started out 30 years ago the communications industry was on the brink of enormous changes changes equivalent to thousands of years in the history of mankind all in the span of three decades back then we didn't really have any telephones the only phones we had were those hand cranked phones that you see in Old World War two films we were pretty undeveloped them while we started out by making simple equipment for rural markets instead of spending the money we earned we invested it back into the business making more and more advanced equipment we were lucky China was developing its network industry on a big scale of the time that's how we found a market for our goods if we tried to start a business today I don't know if we would be successful we worked for survival rather than for ideals how could we possibly have ideals then our priority was to survive today Huawei is the top telecoms network equipment seller in the world how did you do this what do you mean the shingle you sure you don't be Georgia shingle I am an ambitious man if someone can focus on one thing then they will definitely succeed I was focused on communications technology if I had focused on raising pigs I might have become a pig expert if I had focused on making tofu I might have become the king of tofu unfortunately I chose Communications this industry is very challenging hi Jenna but it's hanging we did this without really understanding just how high the barrier to entry was but we started anyway and there was no turning back because if we pulled out then we would have lost everything I had spent all of my initial investment and would have ended up begging on the streets so we had to keep forging ahead one step at a time today Huawei has sprawled out to become a global tech giant I had a chance to see the scale of that growth when I arrived on hua ways newest european-style campus in Shenzhen this is one of the three campuses Huawei has here this campus alone is the size of 345 football fields Wow I cannot believe they built this in the middle of an industrial city around the world it now has over a hundred and eighty thousand workers and it's done all of this in just three decades by any standards that's an astronomical rate of growth but it's not just about how big Huawei has become it's gone from a company aspiring to be Apple to one who's selling more smart phones than Apple and it's been able to achieve this mr. run says because it's a privately owned company not at the mercy of shareholders so it's free to decide its own vision of the future why have we succeeded while other companies found it difficult publicly listed companies have to pay a lot of attention to their balance sheets they can't invest too much otherwise profits will drop and so will their share prices at huawei we fight for our ideals we know that if we fertilize our soil it will become more bountiful that's how we've managed to pull ahead and succeed every year Huawei invests up to twenty billion dollars in R&D putting it in the top five companies for such investment in the world while some American telecom Giants were cutting jobs and closing labs Huawei pumped billions of dollars into new areas of research leepung fee is an engineer at Huawei his team works on what the company calls fundamental questions areas of research that don't have an immediate outcome from my research it is not directly involved in profit most of my work is about fundamental research in the u.s. and my friends who work in Apple who work in Google they work really hard and they have a lot of freedom on their research and I basically have the same similar freedom I'm the same a similar environment like they do have we Chinese people we are trying to develop we are trying to to to be better right we're learning and we're trying our best but some think it's not just investment into R&D that's enabled Huawei to pull ahead of its rivals both sets of charges exposed Huawei's brazen and persistent actions to exploit American companies and financial institutions and to threaten the free and fair global marketplace the US Department of Justice has charged Huawei with intellectual property theft alleging that it stole trade secrets from American firm t-mobile deliberately the Department of Justice has put forward charges saying that Huawei stole technology from an American company do you think that's fair we shall get make Waseca far to go yeah I trust the u.s. is a country ruled by law so everything will ultimately be settled by the law but sometimes I'm also very happy the u.s. is the world's most powerful country and their senior officials are going around the world talking about Huawei including places where we have not launched any advertising campaigns and people didn't know but because of this people everywhere now know of Huawei this is a huge advertisement for us at a very cheap price Cisco Nortel Motorola they've all accused Huawei of stealing their ideas stealing their technology the United States is trying to say why we can't be trusted what do you have to say about that I meant efficient only Chilean in actual fact many of our technologies are already far ahead of those my Western companies not just in 5g or optical switching or our chipsets the number of technologies in which we're leading is huge and these are complex technologies the charges that the US has made against Huawei are fairly marginal sure instrument they're not enough to say that Huawei has become what it is today by stealing from the US today we have many things that the US doesn't how can we steal what they don't have so much atole still the pressures on Huawei are growing and mr. run is not just fighting for his business his family is now involved as well the DOJ has charged mr. Renne daughter and Huawei's chief financial officer Meng Guangzhou with bank fraud and accused her of conspiring to violate American sanctions on Iran what is it like as a father to see your daughter in such a difficult situation Papa Guan China yet when she was detained as her father my heart broke how could I watch my child suffer like this but what happened has happiness what can one do we can only depend on the law to solve this problem I think this hardship is a valuable opportunity in life for her going through such a big event will give her wings for her future growth yokai shame language I should thank the US government for giving mangwon Joe a strong set of wings so she can fly higher in the future I believe that was she a successor that you were grooming that you were hoping to see her you know become the CEO one day how you say uncle Colin Georgie abandoned she could never become my successor because she has no technical background I feel that I shouldn't see my children's trials entirely through her father's eyes I should also see them flying strong and free children must have their own character and find their own way all my children are strong-willed hard-working and drive themselves to excel as their parents we cannot demand that they stay meekly by our side forever we think their personal development is more important despite this huge personal setback while he is pushing ahead with a project where it's leading the world 5g technology by many accounts who always thought to be at least a year ahead of its rivals on this front 5g will herald the start of truly virtual networks and hyper connectivity between everything you can think of all of which is designed to make our lives easier and more automated so I'm probably useful it see it's a detective movie but the Warriors whoever controls the infrastructure behind this technology could potentially control every aspect of our lives in the future jus paying is who always head of 5g wireless research and says that fears of vulnerabilities in 5g are unfounded from technology perspective 5g is is probably it's more secure than the 4G previous generation in the sense that we have build into some more sophisticated security itself needs the cooperation from manufacturer from the operator who runs the network and from the government how much of an advantage is it to be ahead of your competitors when it comes to 5g what does it mean for you this actually probably we will get more footprint so more customer and and this is beneficial for both our customer in terms of operators and our you know consumers you know and its most basic level 5g technology is about connecting everyday items like my toothbrush to the Internet every time I brush my teeth data is collected and analyzed but at its most sophisticated it's about everything in entire cities talking to each other from driverless cars to building temperature to how fast our public transport is and it's already starting to materialize right here in China in an old neighborhood in Shenzhen Huawei is building the framework for the Internet of the future by next year China will have 5g services in several cities and Huawei is already building the infrastructure for 5g in other Asian countries it's amazing isn't it this is 5g going up in front of my eyes generation in the next 20 or 30 years we will see a great technological revolution where we will become an information society automated by artificial intelligence in the era of cloud and AI we will see explosive growth in data bursting forth like a tsunami this data leads the support of the most advanced equipment possible I don't think 5g or any other form of data transmission existing today will truly meet the pinnacle of people's needs I believe there more profound needs that still need to be addressed right now human society is only in the early phases of the massive change that lies ahead we still have a very long way to go before we can deliver faster more real-time more accurate and more affordable information services but highways 5g ambitions have made some countries nervous Australia along with the US has banned Huawei from building the infrastructure for its 5g networks because of security concerns whoever controls the 5g infrastructure has the potential to know a lot more about our lives Tom murren helped inform the government's policy on it he says Huawei is just too big a risk there's been a lot of focus on highway because they're building critical communications networks that'll be really super important into the future in the last several years the Chinese Communist Party has been a lot more coercive and they've they've passed laws that basically compel companies and individuals to assist in intelligence efforts and this really crystallizes worries that companies like Huawei will be forced to help them conduct espionage or perhaps other things [Music] these laws allow the state to ask citizens and organizations for information and they have to comply they have no choice the fear is that Huawei will build a backdoor into its 5g technology allowing the Chinese state access to private data the Chinese government has clearly said that if you won't ask companies to install backdoors and Huawei will not do it either our sales revenue is now hundreds of billions of dollars we are not going to risk the disgust of our country and our customers all over the world because of something like that we will lose all our business and then we would not be able to repay the banks I'm not going to take that risk I said I would shut the company down also to express a kind of determination we will not do this to add to this suspicion there's also mr. Renne links to the Chinese military before founding Huawei he was an engineer in the People's Liberation Army I was a very low ranking officer in the People's Liberation Army after leaving the army I had no connection or interaction with it I was not the high ranking officer the US has made me out to be please don't think that Huawei has become what it is today because we have special connections even a hundred percent state-owned companies have failed do good connections mean you will succeed then Huawei success is still very much due to our hard work there has been no conclusive evidence that Huawei has been helping the Chinese government to spy on other countries but concerns that it could have been enough for the u.s. to pressure its allies including the UK to stop doing business with Huawei altogether while Australia has outright bans the use of Huawei equipment in its 5g networks the UK and New Zealand are leaving the door open for now Huawei's global cyber security program is run in London by John Suffolk he used to be the UK government's chief information officer and understands the level of suspicion targeted at the company the reality is we are a Chinese headquartered company we're very proud of our Chinese heritage in our Chinese roots not everybody a understands you know the modern China not everybody is in favor of the modern China and some will even see China as a threat as they saw you know Japan in the car industry in terms of the 70s and the 80s we have to ignore that we have to continue to satisfy what our customers want we have to continue to be open and transparent and then businesses will make the decision based on who will provide them with the greatest long-term value what kind of impact would it have on your business if the US is successful in getting many of its partners in the West to shut your equipment out vanya if the lights go out in the West the East will still shine and if the north goes dark then there is still the south america doesn't represent the world america only represents a portion of the world but security concerns continue to keep Huawei under scrutiny in particular the company's relationship with the Chinese Communist Party under China's modern facade is a system that's still very different from what the West knows you have to have a communist party committee in your company in China it's the law most big CEOs are members of the party even alibaba's Jack Ma these political connections are necessary to do business here and many just see them as a formality but they do raise questions about the independence of Chinese companies still you have to ask yourself if you were running a company in China how else would you operate Jun it's a fine equating according to Chinese law all companies in China including Chinese and foreign companies must establish a communist party committee and we must all obey the law in fact before we established a party committee motorola IBM and coca-cola had already established fares the communist party committee at Huawei serves only to educate its employees it is not involved in any business decisions I think all companies are by their own country's laws when when they're they need to so this happens for all telecommunications companies the difference it happens in the West the difference is that in the West there's independent courts and judiciary's and companies can actually contest those decisions in China there's not the same independence and rule of law I find it very hard to believe that a Chinese company can operate totally independently of the Communist Party if the Communist Party thinks that it is it needs to do something to protect itself it will can you see how difficult it is for many people around the world to believe you are free of influence from the Chinese Communist Party many countries may choose not to believe us or work with us but the world is big there are still many countries that welcome us we have already 131 5g contracts and shipped over 30,000 5g base stations anna-chan gana the hua people are increasingly aware of our advanced products and are more willing to accept us let the facts speak for themselves we cannot depend on speculation it's not the law it's been a long journey for mr. run whose life's work of building Huawei has in many ways mirrored the rise of China sanctions in Eng my mu Joshi vanyusha 30 or 40 years ago I did not study in the West many of my good friends went to the US and Canada to study this is because I served in the military I had no idea card and thus had no right to do so I missed that era after they came back to China my friends told me what a supermarket was I had no idea back then you could imagine how little we knew of what a market economy was at the time I was someone who had been in the military all my life at the time used to doing exactly what I was told suddenly I began to work in a market economy engaging in product transactions I was at a total loss so I too suffered losses I too was deceived and I was cheated but I had to pick myself up because I had a wife and a child and I had to provide for them it's that stealing as' shaped from past experiences that has helped mister run steer his company through an unprecedented level of global scrutiny was Sochi an F and Omega Java I object to what the US has done this kind of politically motivated Act is not acceptable the u.s. likes to sanction others whenever there's an issue they'll use such methods we object to this but now that we've gone down this path we'll let the court settle it despite the current level of skepticism attached to Huawei he's still able to see this as a mixed blessing there is no impact on Huawei's business due to Hmong windows loss of freedom in fact we're growing even faster thank you it's wrong so they got among wonder maybe they arrested the wrong person they may have thought if they arrested her that Huawei would fault but we didn't fall we are still moving forward for mr. run moving forward is not merely an option for Huawei it's the only way to survive [Music] hi guys it's SPRT and this is the huawei mate Pad Pro and many people are saying that this is one of the best Android tablets 2020 I've been using it for about a week or so so it's time to take a deep dive and see what the hardware's like what the software's like and see exactly what you get for your money quick disclaimer while we were kind enough to provide me with this device and sponsor this video but all views are my own firstly let's see what happened in the quicker boxing that I did and if you lift the lid straight away you're greeted with the tablet which we can put to one side and underneath we have the SIM card ejector charging plug and charging cable they also sent across the keyboard case and an pencil which we'll touch on later overall it's very nice clean minimalistic packaging and this runs right through the tablet design and build quality as well from the map midnight grey coloring to the symmetrical four speaker grilles and the tiny bezels at just four point nine millimeters this thing looks and feels incredibly premium in fact the only thing that I'm not mad keen on design wise is the slight discoloration around the front facing camera on that display which is indicative of pretty much all LCD displays that have a punch hole cut out that screen is 2 K at 2560 by 1600 has a peak brightness of over 500 nits and is ten point eight inches in size which from my point of view is just about the perfect size for a tablet any bigger and it starts to become a little bit too cumbersome and any smaller and it starts to feel more like a phablet the display has an icon for mode which is certified for low blue light emissions by two rhineland also with the DCI p3 cinematic color gamut a 90 percent screen to body ratio and the four mentioned stereo speakers this thing is excellent for watching the movies and TV shows you love oh and while we're on that subject I'm now completely out of all content to watch so if you've got any recommendations for movies and TV shows that I should be watching let me know in the comments now of course in order to watch all your favorite content you need to kind of know where to go and get it and map bring this round to apps and software now there's no denying that over the last few months things have become a little bit complicated on a software front for Huawei but there seems to be a bit of a misconception when it comes to what you can and can't use on the latest Huawei devices so starting from the top the mate Pad Pro is running Android 10 with emui 10 over the top which is of course Huawei skin it's very slick fluid and negotiating around this tablet has been great but there is no Google Play services which means there's no Google Play Store so some people have said well hang on how do I get the apps that I love them and you can do that in four main ways the first way is when you transfer your information from a previous device you can link them using the phone clone app which is available on all of the latest Huawei devices and it's available on the Google Play Store once the two devices are linked most of the apps on your previous phone or tablet will transfer across to your mate pad Pro the next way is using while Waze app portal known as the app gallery now yes there's not been everything that I personally need on the app gallery but it is growing all the time and that combined with the phone clone app and the next two methods I'm pretty much set so those final two methods are number one downloading certain apps that you want straight from their respective websites that aren't available on the App Gallery and finally you can set website shortcuts almost like an app on your home screen so that when you click on it it goes straight through to that specific website as I've done here for YouTube and yes while this might not be quite as good as using a native YouTube app the mobile website runs pretty well on all tablets right so it's just in the middle of editing this video when why we decided to drop a brand new app called petal search find apps which allows you to download even more apps and I did a little thing with them on Instagram I'm going to show you that footage right now and it's this one here called petal search find apps and it's designed by wile way and actually powered by their third-party search partners so the home screen actually loads like this so you've got lots of different trending news topics etc and this bit up here is a search section where you can type in a specific app that you might want to actually try and download and what it does is actually pull apps from the quarrei app gallery and also from the Internet as a whole web developers have posted apks for example directly from their web sites like whatsapp and Facebook and also credible third party app stores it's just a really handy tool to help make finding apps a little bit easier as an example I'll type in Facebook here and as you can see there's a list of different apps click on install will click on open just so you can see and there you go Facebook loads up ready to rock and roll on your p40 pro for example and it means that I've got my social medias available my media consumption available and my gaming goodies available as well now speaking of gaming using the main power Pro has been excellent the Kirin 990 in here is the same as we've seen on the mate 30 Pro and the P 40 pro as well their smartphones and it's the latest and greatest from huawei and it's right up there as one of the most powerful chips available right now you've also got up to 8 gigabytes of RAM and 512 gigabytes of storage so using this tablet this week for all of my gaming needs has really been superb something that certainly can't be said for my ability in this game shocking i I am I am shocking at certain games now if you are going to be gaming well you will be pleased to know it has 12 layers of cooling components and you'll also probably want to know how good the battery is how's it going to hold up if you're going to be there for hours well with its 7,000 250 mAh battery capacity and 40 watts fast charging it really shouldn't leave you wanting it's also capable of 15 watts wireless charging and reverse wireless charging as well so if you wanted to charge your phone or your earbuds etc you can do that just resting it on your tablet basically a remote battery pack now one thing that I just simply wouldn't do on a tablet is use it as a camera I don't quite get that element to but I know there are some of you out there that really will so what do we have in terms of the snappers on this bad boy the snappers well we've got a 13 megapixel sensor with F 1.8 aperture LED flash and video recording up to 4k at 30 frames a second and that front-facing punch hole cutout camera is 8 megapixels with F 2.0 aperture and 1080p at 30 frames a second video so yes it's not going to give you the most variety in a camera but like I said it'll do you for a quick snap a quick video don't be that but you can be that person it's fine now unfortunately that camera does impact on the form factor as we do have a slight bump on the back which will bother some of you and not just know there is a slight table rock because of it but that isn't the case if you're using the keyboard case which also adds more functionality to the may pad Pro now no it won't replace a laptop for me as there's no trackpad etc but the actual build and keys are good and it does make negotiating webpages and typing emails and documents much easier and of course keeps your device safe from bumps and scrapes when being chucked into a bar get cetera the keyboard attaches to the tablet via magnets as does the EM pencil which has sub 20 millisecond latency which means the input lag is imperceptible to the human eye making writing on the screen as natural as on paper this is excellent for artists graphic designers or just those who love a good old doodle now one of the big things that people use tablets for is productivity using that bigger screen real estate and if you're looking to maximize workflow capabilities the multi window and app multiply features mean you can multitask and really make use of that larger display also with the Huawei share feature you can connect your compatible Huawei phone to the mate pad pro and share files instantly and screen mirror for ultimate ecosystem compatibility so we're down to the good old conclusion do I think the huawei mate pad pro is one of the best Android devices you can buy right now well for performance and premium design I'd have to say yes it works flawlessly it feels incredible in the hand and it really is a fantastic device if we're talking software it's got Android 10 it's running with the latest emui which I do actually quite like and I've been able to get nearly all of the apps that I personally use and for those that I can't I've either downloaded from the website browser or I've used website shortcuts so for me it really comes down to the individual if you're happy doing those things then I can highly recommend this product that's it not much more I can say stuff to think about but an incredible bit of kit never know you think of the huawei mate Pad Pro in the comment section below do you like it you dislike it is there other things that you prefer into tablet into tablet world into tablet world not let's just end it here like and share if you enjoyed the video and found it helpful subscribe and hit the notification bell if you love everything tech breaking tech news unboxings reviews I love you I'll see in the next one [Music] chinese smartphone maker huawei has released its much anticipated harmony operating system it's developed by its in-house team for use across all of its smartphones and smart hardware devices instead of google's android but can harmony really hang with android and apple's ios which currently have a duopoly in the operating systems market [Music] harmony's origins date back to 2012 the huawei founder in jinfei and a small team of executives held a closed door meeting to brainstorm ideas on reducing its dependency on android they feared such a heavy reliance would leave the company vulnerable if it were to face a u.s ban fast forward seven years and that ban came to fruition in may 2019 after the u.s cut off huawei from american control technology new huawei devices sold outside china lost access to google services on the official version of android google services on android devices had long been unavailable in china about three months later huawei unveiled harmony os known as hong in chinese huawei builds harmony as the world's most advanced os for the next generation of smartphones and other smart devices i like google and apple which use separate oss for different types of electronic products huawei says harmony can be used across different devices including pcs smartware products automobiles smart speakers and earphones and eventually devices like vr glasses huawei has also developed a tool called the art compiler which makes it easier for app developers to tweak the apps they've made for android and make them work on harmony huawei hopes its art compiler will help harmony succeed where other alternative os's have failed microsoft launched its own os for its windows phone family but failed to entice developers to make apps for it and eventually abandon it all together in 2017 and samsung's attempt to replace android on smartphones with this tizen os also failed but getting users to switch over to harmony is going to be an uphill battle for huawei android and ios have a strangle hold on smartphone operating systems with almost 99 of the global market share and it's too early to tell whether app developers will use the art compiler to make their apps work on harmony after the launch of the latest version of harmony on june 2nd huawei released a list of partners who use the os but not a single smartphone maker is on that list so whether app makers will adapt their creations to harmony very much depends on how consumers embrace the new os and how its new smart devices [Music] hello world an embarrassing huawei vulnerability was ignored for months the world's largest password leak has been dumped on hacking forums or has it there's a new old cybercram gang on the block and this remarkably elaborate fake streaming site is going to impressive lengths to install malware on your pc that's in today's episode of the week web where we break down and dissect cyber security related tech news [Music] huawei has come under fire for an embarrassing vulnerability in one of their lte usb sticks these things are meant to provide cellular connectivity to laptops but came with an extra hidden feature a researcher at trustwave discovered the bug which only affects mac os users the software these dongles come packaged with creates a root owned script which autoruns every time the device is inserted usually this script just opens the device's management interface but the researcher noticed the permissions on the script were set incorrectly which meant any user regardless of their privileges could overwrite the script and execute malware on the victim pc every time the device was inserted sure this may not sound all that interesting at the end of the day a miscreant would require local access to the computer in order to exploit it along with the victim using a very specific lte adapter as well as running on mac os in the grand scheme of things this is a relatively low risk vulnerability but the reason this exploit has turned out a little embarrassing for huawei is in how they handled it the researcher first contacted huawei last october to report the problem and have it fixed but heard no response he persisted for several months and still didn't have much luck until news website the register pestered huawei about it and eventually it got resolved you would expect a little better from one of the world's largest telecom equipment providers huawei has a pretty poor track record when it comes to security this instance is relatively mild compared to their previous blunders for example back in 2019 when many countries were becoming dubious about using huawei equipment in their 5g networks the uk commissioned a report into huawei equipment the report went through a lot of source code to identify if there were any hidden back doors or security holes and whilst they didn't find any backdoors they did find some horrendous security practices in one instance they found four different open ssl versions being used within the same piece of software which were vulnerable to a myriad of exploits with some dating back to 2006. openssl for the uninitiated is used to implement a secure communication layer which as you can imagine is pretty important especially in telecommunications equipment following these findings the uk issued a blanket ban on huawei equipment at a cost of 2 billion pounds billions of passwords have been leaked and you should be incredibly worried according to certain news sites so should you scramble to change your passwords as yeah who puts it or is this all a bit of a non-story well a user on raidforms has posted a 100 gigabytes txt file which they claimed comprised 82 billion passwords in reality the file contains just 8 billion plaintext passwords according to cybernews but in fairness that is still quite a few the poster dubbed this dump rockq 2021 which is probably why this new story has been getting so much attention the original rock q password list is famous in the hack world and originates from the now dissolved company rock u which was hacked way back in 2009. the hackers used a 10 year old sql vulnerability to breach the company and 32 million passwords were leaks the hack wasn't handled very well firstly password stored in plain text should be a no-no the company also took ages to notify its users it was all just one massive disaster the password list rockq.txt went on to gain a lot of notoriety in the hacker community and it even comes preloaded in kali the new version though rockq2021.txt is less exciting whilst yes it is over 250 times the size of the original version this new iteration seems to just be a compilation of previous smaller breaches there's sadly or gladly nothing new to see here it was probably only named as such to increase the attention it received however certain websites have gotten all hyped up over this new leak and have dubbed it the mother of all password leaks when in reality there's no real needs to scramble to check have i been pwned over this news if you weren't pwned yesterday this leak isn't going to have changed that researchers at proof points have identified a new old extortion group this group has been around for a while and is known for impersonating various apts such as the russian fantasy bear group as well as the north korean lazarus group they do this in order to scare victims into paying up after all if you believe in elites russian state-sponsored hacking group is after you you're well within your rights to be a little spooked well now the shape-shifting gang is back and have christened themselves fancy lazarus if larping as one world renowned apt wasn't enough now they've figured out a way to cover both fronts at the same time innovation at its finest this group sends out emails to victim companies threatening to shut down their operations with a two terabits per second ddos attack if a ransom of two bitcoin isn't paid within a matter of days this price increases for each day past the payment deadline ddos attacks have seen quite an uptick during lockdowns as people working from home need to use company servers if these go down then you have an issue it's one thing for your customer facing website to become inaccessible but if your employees can't even work then it's a whole other mess luckily for the victims of fancy lazarus an fbi flash details that their threats are more often than not bluffs as most organizations targeted do not receive that two terabits of power or if they did it was easily mitigated there's a new fake streaming service on the interwebs bravo movies is a remarkable example of the extent some bad actors will go to in order to compromise your pc on the face of it brother movies looks like any other streaming service but on closer inspection some of its top-rated movies look a little odd judging by its cover you'd be forgiven for thinking the dog woof is a critically acclaimed intense psychological thriller unfortunately i must disappoint you in that it doesn't exist in fact none of these films exist i'm not sure why our bad actors here went to the trouble of making covers for fake films there are plenty of real ones out there and i don't think the possibility of copyright infringement should be too high up their list of worries the fact they're trying to hack you with this site is more of a crime i would have thought anyhow the rest of the site is equally elaborate and rather convincing cyber security company proofpoint wrote a report which details just how this site aims to ransack your pc victims would receive a phishing email a rather poorly put together one considering just how much effort went into the site anyhow the email claimed that the recipient's bravo movie's free trial was coming to an end and then their card was about to be charged of course there was no free trial the objective of this email was to convince users that they had somehow signed themselves up to a free trial by accident and get them to phone the bravo movie support line and request a cancellation a real person would answer the phone and instruct users to visit the site but clicking the cancel subscription button would for some reason download an excel spreadsheet you might know where this is going the customer service agent told users in order to cancel their subscription they should open the spreadsheet and then enable macros macros in microsoft office are regularly abused macros simply allow custom code to be inserted into an excel or word document so enabling macros in an untrusted document is as bad as opening an untrusted exe file luckily for criminals this is a little known fact enabling macros in this case would cause basal loader to be covertly installed basilodi is a first stage payload meaning it's used to download additional malware proofpoints didn't observe what the second stage payload in this campaign was however baseloader has been known to install ransomware the infection chain here is really quite involved there's a lot of user has to do in order to become pwned usually bad actors don't create such elaborate infection chains as it increases friction for the user which usually means less people end up getting infected cyber criminals prefer infection vectors which are less hassle it's really quite interesting that streaming cancellation has been used as a vector in this campaign as according to fortune in the past few months people have been scrambling to reduce the streaming services that they're subscribed to as during the pandemic with all the free time we had the average streaming customer had five subscriptions but unsurprisingly that's now falling seeing an opportunity to cash in this may have been what prompted criminals to go after the trend to just convince people that bravo movies was one of the streaming services that they had signed up to and just forgotten bravo movies has since disappeared from the internet in the last few days if you enjoy this kind of video make sure to help me out by hitting a like for the youtube ai as well as turn on those sub notifications if you're looking for something to watch next go check out my previous video on how the fbi modified google pixels introducing a secret backdoor allowing them to spy on criminals and track their every move if you like this series of videos do consider becoming a channel member as always sources will be linked in the video description stay tuned for more hacking videos and have a good one hey what's up guys will here for gsm arena huawei is here with their new tablet the matepad pro 12.6 this is the first device we've seen come out with the company's new harmony os their alternative to google's android so how does the new mate pad hold up either software wise or as a tablet let's find out in our full review [Music] as far as looks go the matepad pro 12.6 doesn't break the mold it's a pretty sizable tablet built around a 12.6 inch oled screen and the bezels are reasonably thin and even on all sides overall the matepad pro looks elegant and premium it's not too heavy and feels secure in your hands we're not exactly sure what this back panel is made from but ours is in the matte gray finish which also covers the curved aluminum frame as i mentioned the screen is a 12.6 inch oled it has a screen resolution of 2560x1600 giving you a total of 240 ppi that's pretty sharp though a bit less than rivals like the galaxy tab s7 plus also unlike the galaxy tab screen which has a fast 120hz refresh rate here you have just a standard 60hz panel and okay last one you don't get a sunlight boost to the screen brightness like the galaxy tab does though the max brightness with a slider is still very good for a tablet at around 380 nits overall this screen looks nice you get deep oled blacks here and vivid colors and depending on the color mode you choose you can get a really good color accuracy plus even though youtube is a google service you can run it just fine in your browser with 4k playback one thing to be aware of though is that although the matepad pro supports hdr10 and google's widevine l1 drm it isn't recognized officially by apps like netflix or prime video so while they do work they only offer sd content for streaming and we'd have to wait to see whether this would change it though since these companies are based in the us for audio the matepad pro 12.6 has quite an impressive setup there are a total of eight speakers behind four speaker grilles each grille has both a large speaker for lows and mids and a smaller one for highs all tuned by harman kardon this is one of the best audio experiences we've had on a portable device the speakers sound incredible deep and rich and earned a very good score on our loudness charts [Music] [Applause] [Music] there is no 3.5 millimeter jack on this device for traditional headphones you'll need to use a usbc adapter and in some markets huawei provides one in the box another thing you won't find on the matpad pro is a fingerprint reader for biometric security your only option is facial recognition and not the more secure 3d scanning type either one cool feature you have here is stylus support through huawei's m pencil but unlike with the galaxy tab s7 plus this doesn't come bundled you'll have to buy it separately and it isn't cheap the pencil itself is great though it's responsive and precise offering nine millisecond latency and the screen supports up to 4096 pressure sensitive levels with supported apps just like samsung's s pen the stylus runs on a battery and it'll recharge wirelessly when you click it under the magnetic holder on the side of the tablet the other available accessory is the smart magnetic keyboard it's a full-blown keyboard cover stand which snaps to the tablet magnetically the keys have enough movement and provide excellent tactile feedback and the whole thing works as advertised the matepad pro 12.6 is the first device we've encountered that runs huawei's own harmony os 2.0 out of the box it's their replacement for android it turns out that it's based on a fork of android 10 integrated with emui and it allows you to run android apps that aren't dependent on google services the interface looks familiar if you're used to emui there is an app dock at the bottom that's shared between all home screens there's an optional app drawer too and you can swipe from the top for a notification center and a control center huawei provides their own multimedia apps and plenty of others including pedal maps pedal search and huawei browser the app gallery is the default for app installation and it works well the library is getting pretty extensive by now but the search bar will also give you pedal search results from other app stores and repositories to find what you need on top of the 128 or 256 gigs on board you have expandable storage here but you need to use one of huawei's proprietary nano memory cards to do that multitasking on the matepad pro 12.6 is a breeze swiping and holding from either the right or the left side will reveal the multi-windows sidebar where you can see all the apps that have multitasking support tapping on an icon will open an app in a floating popup window or drag and drop the icons for a split screen view you can have two active apps no matter which multitasking mode you're using while you don't have a desktop mode here like on past emui devices or samsung's decks you can still connect the matpad pro to a huawei laptop through a feature called multi-screen collaboration mirror mode will mirror your laptop's screen onto the tablet so that you can use the m pencil and touch screen for your pc apps extend mode turns the tablet into a second monitor of the laptop it becomes an extension of your windows desktop and collaboration mode lets you drag and drop content between both devices for easy file transfer or if you have a huawei phone running at least emui 10 you can connect it and have its screen appear on the maidpad pro's display this is handy not only for file exchange but you can use the tablet to make calls or write text this way too behind all of these features is a huawei kirin 9000e 5g chipset it's like their flagship kirin 9000 but with a light version of the gpu still graphics performance should be more than enough here the games we tried worked great and the ui is quite smooth it's also worth mentioning that although the matepad pro 12.6 has a 5g capable chipset we are reviewing the cheaper wi-fi only model here powering the device is a massive 10 050 milliamp hour battery and it does an excellent job we were able to measure almost 11 hours of web browsing screen on time or 15 hours of video playback and charging speed is quite fast if you consider the size of the battery our matepad pro 12.6 came with a 40 watt huawei supercharger in the box and with it we were able to charge the tablet from zero to 33 percent in half an hour the tablet also supports up to 27 watt wireless charging and you can do reverse wireless charging here too now onto the cameras there's a 13 megapixel primary camera an 8 megapixel ultra wide cam and a 3d tof camera for portraits the main cams 13 megapixel photos are sharp enough and detailed with reasonably low noise good contrast accurate colors and great dynamic range fine and complex detail like foliage doesn't always come out great though with some smudging due to the processing the 8 megapixel ultra wide photos are detailed with good sharpness and low noise for this type of camera the dynamic range is once again great the color rendition does seem to be cooler than the main cams though in low light photos from the main camera have good color saturation and balance exposure they are lacking in detail though and soft due to the aggressive noise reduction turn on night mode and each shot will take around 10 seconds to process it does improve the overall exposure and exposes more detail but the images are still soft and have an oil painting sort of look you can use the ultra wide camera at night time but the photos are smudgy noisy desaturated and lacking in detail and there's no night mode selfies from the 8 megapixel front facing cam are great they are detailed with excellent contrast and accurate colors the dynamic range is good and the exposure is well tuned for selfies video can be recorded in up to 4k resolution at 30fps with a main or ultrawide cam and stabilization is always on footage from the main camera is very good with enough detail low noise excellent contrast and wide dynamic range 4k video quality from the ultra wide is decent with commendable dynamic range the footage is a bit softer than the main cams and the colors are colder too just like with the still photos so that's the huawei mate pad pro 12.6 you get an elegant design a large high-res oled screen outstanding speaker quality excellent battery life with fast charging and dependable cameras the m pen adds the experience as well if you're fine buying it separately and harmony os is better than expected it's android based and can run most android apps the thing is we can't help but compare the mate pad to samsung's galaxy tab s7 plus which also has a high refresh rate a fingerprint scanner no restrictions in google apps or streaming quality and the stylus comes in the box plus at least at launch the mate pad is more expensive still with all that said if you're already invested in huawei's growing device ecosystem or you want to support them in their push for independence the matepad pro 12.6 is a tablet worth recommending thanks for watching guys stay safe and see you on the next one [Music] you what's up guys chigz here from cheeks tech movies [Music] so today i've got my hands on a brand new flagship smartwatch so this smartwatch has the potential to be one of the best smart watches we have seen this year and i am super excited as this is the one i've been waiting for so let me introduce you to the huawei watch 3 pro now the pro version can be picked up for around 499 on amazon and the standard huawei watch 3 active model is priced around 349. without any further ado let's get this box open shall we are you not ready for this check that out people just look at this beauty first of all take a few seconds to indulge in what you're seeing here this is what i call design excellence now the new model is powered by the harmony os um you have a super premium build quality with a whole host of smart health tracking features and lots more so first of all let's have a quick look at what you get inside the box so you've got your paperwork so a wireless magnetic usb charger similar to what we've seen in the past from huawei watches this also comes with some silicon straps with a metal buckle and you can see huawei engraved on that metal so silicon straps are very useful if you're going to go swimming you're not going to want to use the metal straps now here are some spares for you so if this metal watch strap didn't fit you you can adjust the size and check this out people how easy it is you don't need any tools you can just push down that button to release these and adjust the size accordingly these are spare i've actually already adjusted it to size so and kept the spares in this box awesome stuff i like that you don't need tools to do that and last but not least the watch itself i'm a watchman i like my watches you can tell when i'm reviewing watches how i feel now this is not an ordinary watch this is not just a super premium fitness tracker because that's what the previous model was and i have it right here hawaii watch gt2 pro this was just a super premium fitness watch now to make more sense in what i'm saying this is the samsung galaxy watch 3. it's a full featured smart watch so that means you get an app store third-party app support music control full host of health features and lots more so that's a full featured watch and this watch here is just a fitness tracker no third party app support or any other additional features apart from fitness so that is the previous model huawei watch gt2 pro and this new model the huawei watch 3 is in fact a full featured smart watch so you do get an app gallery there are ota updates there is third party app support although the app gallery is a bit limited in the choices of apps that are actually available i'm sure that list is going to grow pretty quick so the build quality is no doubt attractive the watch body is made from aerospace titanium alloy let me just release one side so i can show you guys the build quality and if you ever look here it's just a simple button press it and lift up and that's how easy it is to change these straps so you have no doubt an attractive build quality the watch body is made from aerospace grade titanium alloy fused with sapphire glass on top to give you that super durability and premiumness on your wrist you do have time markings going all the way around and i have to say a very beautiful looking watch now the back of the watch is made from a ceramic glass material it's uh it's got a very nice smooth finish to it it feels very nice on the skin actually it's very comfortable on the wrist now on the front we have a 1.43 inch amoled display with a screen resolution of 466 by 466 now the watch is powered by huawei's harmony os for connectivity and you do also have 2 gigahertz wi-fi built in bluetooth 5.2 a 5 satellite gps and built-in nfc you can expect a battery life of around 5 days in smart mode and 21 days if you switch to the ultra long battery mode furthermore you do have 5 atm water resistant rating which means you can go swimming and the watch can track your swimming stats including strokes distance calories etc now the watch dimensions are 48 millimeters in diameter with a thickness of 14 millimeters and the watch weighs grams with the straps on now to give you an idea of the size of this watch i'm going to bring in the huawei watch gt2 pro so on the right we have the gt2 pro which is 46 millimeters in diameter with a 1.39 inch screen it's 11.4 millimeters thick and it weighs only 53 grams compared to the huawei watching 3 which is 48 millimeters in diameter with a 1.43 inch screen it's 14 millimeters in thickness and it weighs around 100 grams so it looks like the watch 3 pro is bigger in overall dimensions bigger screen and also thicker and slightly heavier now these straps here are made from titanium so you're getting that super premium looking finish now the watch feels very comfortable on the wrist especially considering the large size and weight of the watch furthermore these traps are easy to remove and replace with your own 22 millimeter band so you've seen what the titanium looks like i do want to remove these and show you what these standard silicon straps looks like especially if you're someone who likes swimming it's advisable to use the silicone straps so standard silicone straps very comfortable and it naturally feels lighter we're gonna have to weigh this now so with the silicone straps this watch weighs 94.8 grams now on the side of the watch we have two buttons we've got a 3d rotating crown so you can use it to scroll up and down through menus and if you're looking at the app drawer you can actually zoom in and out when you're rotating that crown you do get some haptic feedback so it is a satisfying feel it's nearly as satisfying as the samsung galaxy watch so good move by huawei i really do like these sort of rotating features so 3d rotating crown and you have a flat button as well and this flat button is currently set to workouts but you can change that to open any app you like so that is customizable now on the other side we have nothing at the bottom of the watch we have our health sensors so heart rate and spo2 and you also have wireless charging so here is the wireless charger i quickly show you in action so just goes on top and you can plug that into any 5 watt usb source now it does take around 90 minutes to fully charge the watch but the smartwatch also supports wireless charging so you can place this onto any wireless charger and you can see the smartwatch is immediately charging but not only that if you have a smartphone that supports reverse wireless charging you can charge this smartwatch with your smartphone now this watch connects to your smartphone via bluetooth and uses the huawei health app now i'm connected to an android smartphone this is the s21 and android will give you full functionality i am yet to test this watch with ios and i will follow up with a specific ios video to show you what works and what doesn't now quick look at the huawei watch app features so this is your health overview when you open the app it will show you your steps distance calories you've also got your exercises and the last exercise you've done will show up here you've got your heart rate sleep weight you've got your stress and sbo2 and you can also edit all of these options and move them around now over here you've got exercise so you can initiate different exercises but you can also do that directly from the watch so you don't even need to keep this phone in your pocket you can leave the phone at home this has got built-in gps in fact it's got a built-in five satellite gps and you can leave your phone at home it also supports esim so it can work like a standalone phone now when you select devices you'll see the watch and battery life it'll give you some basic health information there as well and then you'll see your watch face gallery so you got recommended and you've got mine mine means the watch faces that you currently have so you can see there are quite a few watch faces that are pre-installed these are ready for you to use so you can change to any of these so if you want this kung fu one press select and you can see what's happening in the background it immediately changes so no waiting around it basically changes straight away um let's do this one here it's called magical you can see how quickly it changes amazing you can definitely feel that performance when using this smartwatch under the recommended sections you will be able to download more watch faces now you can see the prices start from 199 to 4.99 but if you look carefully you will see some that just say installed and they are the free watch faces so yeah we've got free watch faces amongst a whole bunch of paid but you do have to find them and there doesn't seem to be any filter so you can actually filter out the free ones so that's definitely something hawaii needs to look into you can you can type in free it's still not going to bring them up so yeah you need to really observe carefully if you want to find those free watch faces there is a banner at the top which says 100 free watch faces so you can claim 100 free watch faces just for buying this watch so you can tap claim now and then you can see that half of them are already installed but there are quite a few that you can install so these are all free watch faces right now that you can download so those were your watch faces you've got health monitoring true sleep enabled activity reminder continuous heart rate automatic stress tests automatic spo2 so this watch can automatically detect your spo2 throughout the day that is brilliant i really like that and that's the same with the stress test and that's also the same with skin temperature so a new feature for this watch is skin temperature measurement and i've got this feature off at the moment because i like to manually test it when i want but if you switch that on it will continuously test your skin temperature throughout the day which is quite useful for health professionals especially now we've got notifications enabled and you can select which apps you want notifications on for and which ones you want them off from here you'll be able to set up your own esim and once you do that this becomes a fully standalone smartwatch hopefully i get to test that out in the near future device settings you've got music playback control bluetooth disk connection reminder app management and if you tap on app management it just says contacts on or off so if we go back and then the final option there is restore factory default settings now as soon as i paired up the watch to my samsung galaxy s21 i was immediately greeted by an update message and the update was around 200 megabytes i did the update and that activated some of the latest features so gesture recognition so you can answer a phone call just by clinching your fist skin temperature detection custom watch faces and the app market brought to huawei health now this watch is running the brand new harmony os so do expect a lot of firmware updates the support so far has been fantastic so i do look forward to seeing what other features they bring to this watch as i mentioned earlier this is a proper full featured smartwatch it has built in wi-fi bluetooth gps nfc it's running harmony os and you can manage and download many third-party apps already and the app list is growing every day the huawei watch 3 pro is a super smart watch with some extensive all-day health tracking features which includes all-day heart rate spo2 monitoring skin temperature monitoring and lots more this smartwatch will also allow you to make and receive phone calls so there is a keypad you can see your contacts and you can actually initiate a phone call directly from your watch you don't have to touch your phone everything can be done on the watch so let's just test out the bluetooth call quality it's a private number so it says unknown answering the call and if you turn the dial you can actually turn the volume up and down how cool is that all right so this is a bluetooth phone called test i'm talking directly into my smartphone and you should hear my voice loud and clear on the co-op watch 3 pro so this should give an idea of the speaker quality of the smartwatch now let's sort things around okay so i've just swapped things around i am now speaking directly into my smart watch and you should hear my voice loud and clear on my smartphone so this should give an idea of what the microphone quality is like on this huawei watch 3 pro so that was bluetooth phone calls uh very impressed so far now you can change your watch face directly from the watch all you do is keep the center press for a few seconds you'll feel some haptic feedback and then you'll be presented with a whole bunch of watch faces that you can immediately change to so your sport for choice with watch faces but there is also a plus at the end if you tap it it will give you an even bigger selection so quick look at some of the best watch faces available on this watch [Music] [Applause] [Music] another thing i'm pleased to see is you can customize some of these watch faces so if we again keep the center press you will see a settings icon under certain watch faces and they are the ones you can edit so that one as well now let's just select this one for example hit settings and you can see there you've got three complications that you can change now to customize things you just tap on any of these three the first one is set to air pressure if you tap it you're about to choose any of this and i'll use the 3d crown to scroll so you can choose altitude battery world clock activity hours sleep time humidity so i'm going to choose i'm actually going to choose battery over here then the second one i want to change it to my activity and the third one i want to change to my sleep as that's something that i'm always constantly tracking once you're done just press the button and you will see the new layout now time to check out the features if we swipe down from the top you've got your quick toggles battery information and connection info so you can see nfc icon there you can see the bluetooth icon and i've actually got wi-fi switched off at the moment so over here you can see quick toggles for settings aeroplane mode drain so when you tap drain it will drain out any excess water that might be trapped in in the watch so shake until it gives you all the instructions so cool feature there you've got vibration screen on find phone so if you lost your phone tap it and my phone is ringing i'm here yep it's quite loud actually you've got fine phone you've got do not disturb flashlight and alarm and you can also go into the main settings directly from here if you swipe towards the right you've got your weather now unfortunately i have not managed to activate my local weather it just hasn't worked for me but fortunately when i woke up the next day the weather was working absolutely fine no idea how but it basically sorted itself out so the weather is working absolutely fine okay if we swipe up you've got your notifications now i really like how notifications come through they look really neat you can open any notification by just tapping on it but the issue here is these notifications are read only i'm connected to an android phone and still i don't have any ability to respond reply to any of these messages i can only read them that's a shame we're not able to reply to notifications could be compatibility with samsung maybe if i connect to a huawei phone or another android phone i do want to see if that makes any difference now if you swipe towards the left you've got some shortcuts or health tiles so the first one you can see clearly it's your health rings if we swipe again you've got your heart rate sensor so as soon as you go to this page it instantly turns on the heart rate sensor and starts checking your heart rate and if we swipe again you've got your blood oxygen monitor and you can see there i've taken the watch off now so it's stopped measuring you can manually measure but as long as you've got the watch on and you've got the continuous feature turned on it will continuously check your blood oxygen which is great and this is the new feature skin temperature i haven't got this set to continuous but you can measure your skin temperature anytime you like if you swipe again you've got a pen here which says custom that lets you manage these health types so you can move things around up and down and it lets you turn on and off um any health tile that you don't like now if you press the 3d crown that brings up all your apps now i really like how the apps are laid out it's a bit reminiscent to ios this is a great feature of harmony os it's the grid launcher app menu and you can see you can zoom in and out using the crown and the crown is very satisfying when you get this watch you're going to find yourself doing this for no reason it just feels really good now from settings you also have the options for the apps to be laid out vertically and i'll go through them with you quickly we've got workouts workout records workout status activity records phone contacts music heart rate sleep spo2 stress breathing exercises weather alarm stopwatch timer compass barometer notepad settings app gallery and skin temperature we've got voice recording so some of these are open to show you what they look like you've got your air pressure and barometer very useful compass it looks great doesn't it now the music app allows you to stream music from huawei music so you can go to the recommended section for example and you can choose a category so if we just choose easy listening it will immediately start [Applause] playing that's your loudspeaker i suppose so while streaming music works fine i haven't found a way to load up my own mp3s into the watch and considering we have a 16 gig internal storage it would be a good idea to be able to do this and we have timers so you can set really quick timer so let's say one minute timer you can see it clicks away we let that run in the background and see if it actually works skin temperature and it tells you the last reading was two hours ago absolutely brilliant heart rate sensor here are your workouts so there are over a hundred built-in workouts that you can choose from and here is my last night's sleep information six hours and 22 minutes with my goal at eight hours and that is pretty much all the information you can get on the watch if you wanted more detailed report you would have to look at the smartphone app so one minute is up and the watch is vibrating pretty hard i've got the watch on vibration so you can feel vibration if i had it on loud you would hear a loud ring all right we've got workout records so any workouts you've done will be presented here for you to read all the reports detailed reports and of course alarm clock so you can very quickly set alarms and you can set multiple alarms and in case you're wondering this is ultra battery saving mode so you have a standard watch face which you cannot change if you swipe down from the top you've got some quick toggles there including exit ultra battery save mode if you swipe up you've got your notifications swipe left you've got your health tiles and if you swipe right you've got the exact same health tiles so in this mode you're still going to get an all-day heart rate sensor your weather your health rings your sbo2 and your skin temperature monitoring so the extra long battery saving mode will still give you all the health features you need it just turns off the features that require the internet downloading watch faces etc and if you press the 3d crown button even the apps are slightly different so you got workout workout records workout status heart rate spo2 skin temperature activity records sleep stress breathe notifications alarm torch and settings so you already know is that there are quite a few apps missing from there in the 21 day mode some of which i can tell you is the app gallery is missing the phone calls are missing amongst quite a few others so that was your 21 day battery saving mode now it's time to test out the accuracy of the health tracking and this here is the o2 ring you wear it on your thumb it's a medical grade device which can track your heart rate and sbo2 at the same time now let's compare the medical grade sensor to the huawei watch 3 pro and see what sort of results we get no smart watch out there claims to be medical grade standard and my point of this test is to simply show you how close it is to medical grade so first thing we're going to do is test out the heart rate so the heart rate test is running 100 beats per minute and you can see the medical grade has exactly the same 100 beats per minute okay it's dropped down to 85 so heart rate 91 88 heart rate 90 99 100 so they are quite close actually 99.99 so i would say that's a pretty accurate heart rate sensor there you can see it going up and down together maybe a digit up or down but that is pretty accurate all right we're going to run a blood oxygen test so we've got 94 blood oxygen on the o2 ring which has now gone up to 95 and the watch is giving us 97. i would say that's pretty accurate 97 and 95 so it looks like we're getting close to medical grade accuracy in this smart watch all right so another test which i like doing is a screen on hand raised test i've got the samsung galaxy watch 3 on my right wrist and the huawei watch three pro on my left wrist so here we go so we're going to see which one has a faster screen on hand raised so one two three here we go so the samsung galaxy watch three took that straight let's do it again one two three that was the same time slow motion to see who wins and let's try it once more one two three um i think to my naked eye it's quite close i think samsung galaxy watch three edges it slow motion will give us the correct results but not complaining at all pretty fast screen on hand raise from the hawaii watch 3 pro so there you have it guys that was the huawei watch 3 pro and it looks like huawei have done it again the new watch 3 pro is the best looking smart watch i have seen this year now the fitness tracking features are brilliantly presented on both the phone and the watch health tracking is also very accurate now i'm actually pleasantly surprised with harmony os the os is super smooth in operation with beautifully designed menus smooth animations and you have a lot of custom and interactive watch faces to play with the overall smartwatch experience simply blew my mind you can manage your smartwatch apps directly from your smartphone you've got third-party app support and the app gallery is growing every day i want to give you guys a quick look at the app gallery before i forget so this is the featured section here so here is a few apps here and you can see that there are third-party apps but you haven't really heard of any of these so no major apps in the featured section if i actually search for an app and then and that's a good opportunity to test out the keyboard so i'm going to try and search for spotify it's come up because i searched it earlier but i'll type it all the way just to show you that typing on this is pretty good all right so we're searching and there's no results so there's no spotify there's no strava there's no real big third-party app support yet but i really do expect those apps will be coming our way soon and when they do i'll make a video just to cover that topic so yeah this is what i call a next generation full-featured smartwatch so it's not just a glorified fitness tracker like the huawei gt2 pro this is the complete package directly competing with the likes of the samsung galaxy watch three so absolutely stunning build quality i love the ceramic back it feels like glass it's very nice on the wrist very comfortable and that beautiful large amoled display now this screen is bigger than last year's model last year i believe it was 1.39 inches i thought the galaxy watch 3 is large but feast your eyes on that the fact that you hardly have any bezels you've got some time markings the design is just beautiful now the built-in speakers are also good quality so chords and music sound crystal clear the watch does support bluetooth phone calls and e-sim and it's implemented very well notifications are read-only so you cannot reply to any messages emails whatsapps but you can read them now another bonus is five atm water resistance so you can go swimming and you can track your swimming strokes and stats with it now the expected battery life is said to be five days to get anywhere near those five days you probably have to switch off many of the 24 7 continuous health tracking features now my personal experience with all health tracking set to continuous apart from temperature monitoring i also turned off nfc wi-fi and set the brightness to automatic i was able to achieve exactly two whole days of battery life but i was using it with medium to heavy usage downloading lots of watch faces testing various sports modes so yeah medium to heavy usage two whole days with all health tracking set to continuous so it is possible to achieve the five day battery life but you would be switching off the continuous health tracking and expect to use this watch medium to light usage so medium to heavy usage with everything on will give you two to three day battery life max so that is on par with the samsung galaxy watch three this huawei watch 3 pro is a fully featured smart watch just like the galaxy watch 3 and just like the apple watch you have built-in wi-fi bluetooth nfc multi-satellite gps app store for downloads and full health tracking features so yes battery consumption is going to be high and that's totally dependent on your usage so that brings us to the top smartwatch chart of 2021 where you can compare these specs features and prices of all the latest smart watches that i have reviewed on the channel so as you can see the new huawei watch 3 pro has been ranked at position 5. this specific model actually has all the ingredients to achieve top of the table ranking unfortunately it has let itself down in the software area namely lack of apps available to download from the app gallery and the fact that you cannot reply to notifications directly on the watch just these two things corrected would mean higher ranking on this chart now you can view the full versions of all my charts online at chigztech.com and read them at your leisure this is the best looking flagship smartwatch huawei have produced and i must say i really do like it although it's got a big price tag to go with it and it's hard to justify that price even if it's worth the money with the build quality and all so if you're rich and money doesn't bother you then you're going to love this watch it's everything about it is premium the titanium build quality the ceramic back the titanium straps it comes with is also top-notch quality so yeah there is a cheaper version the huawei watch gt3 active i am going to review that very soon and you can pick that up for around 350. um my short time with this watch i can tell you i really really like it do i like it as much as the samsung galaxy watch three i would if there were more big third-party apps to download like strava um and spotify etc and also if i was able to respond to my notifications uh twitter etc i'll quickly show you samsung galaxy watch three there you go that's a youtube comment i can heart this and i'm gonna heart this right now so you guys know it works there you go done it's come up on my phone and it's done and you know who that is all so it's convenient to respond to notifications from your wrists rather than just have them read only i believe it might work on other phones but i've connected to the samsung galaxy s21 samsung is quite a common brand a lot of people are using samsung so i wanted to test it with samsung first and of course we do need to test it out on the iphone as well so i better stop talking otherwise this video is going to be very long thank you so much for watching let me know what you guys want to see in the comments and i'll see you all in the next one [Music] peace you so huawei free buds its range of true so huawei free buds its

connection stayed pretty generally the connection stayed pretty stable stable more often than not occasionally i did more often than not occasionally i did get a little bit of break up certainly get a little bit of break up certainly when i was in a fairly busy area like a when i was in a fairly busy area like a beach beach because i've actually been to a goddamn because i've actually been to a goddamn beach this week wow beach this week wow the range isn't particularly great those the range isn't particularly great those people want to keep your phone or people want to keep your phone or

features here on the huawei freebirds for as well here on the huawei freebirds for as well so for instance if you take out just one so for instance if you take out just one of the buds just pluck it from your head of the buds just pluck it from your head the music or whatever you're listening the music or whatever you're listening to will automatically pause and then to will automatically pause and then when you stick the bud back in it will when you stick the bud back in it will auto resume and i found this feature auto resume and i found this feature worked really worked really really well as long as you don't leave really well as long as you don't leave too long of a pause in between taking too long of a pause in between taking out the bird and putting it back out the bird and putting it back in the auto resume works perfectly every in the auto resume works perfectly every time you've also got a great set of time you've also got a great set of touch controls on the free buds for touch controls on the free buds for as well just gotta touch up towards the as well just gotta touch up towards the top end of the bud top end of the bud it's a double tap to start playing it's a

in between uh playing pause but very very short pretty playing pause but very very short pretty impressive stuff impressive stuff you can also long press in order to you can also long press in order to activate or deactivate active noise activate or deactivate active noise cancellation cancellation and if you want to change the volume as and if you want to change the volume as well that's nice and easy just flick well that's nice and easy just flick up or down the buds and that will change up or down the buds and that will change the volume for you occasionally i did the volume for you occasionally i did find that that didn't quite work first find that that didn't quite work first time but generally more often than not time but generally more often than not it did so not quite comprehensive touch it did so not quite comprehensive touch controls unfortunately you can't skip a controls unfortunately you can't skip a track or anything but they do work track or anything but they do work impressively well compared with a lot of impressively well compared with a lot of rivals rivals as for the audio well huawei has as for the audio well huawei has upgraded the sound compared with upgraded the sound compared with previous buds you know you've got 14.3 previous buds you know you've got 14.3 millimeter millimeter dynamic drivers which do a stunning job dynamic drivers which do a stunning job considering the size of these things you considering the size of these things you get well get well balanced sound and a clear stereo effect balanced sound and a clear stereo effect and apparently huawei has actually added and apparently huawei has actually added in an adaptive equalizer feature to the in an adaptive equalizer feature to the huawei freebirds 4 as well which can huawei freebirds 4 as well which can suss out the shape of your lug holes suss out the shape of your lug holes and then change the output to suit your and then change the output to suit your own particular head shape own particular head shape does that actually work or do anything does that actually work or do anything i've got no bloody clue unfortunately i've got no bloody clue unfortunately all i can tell you is that i personally all i can tell you is that i personally enjoyed enjoyed the sound that was being blasted into my the sound that was being blasted into my head what i can't say though is that head what i can't say though is that you've got to make sure the huawei 3 you've got to make sure the huawei 3 buds 4 are perfectly buds 4 are perfectly positioned because if they're just ever positioned because if they're just ever so slightly wonkys the audio isn't being so slightly wonkys the audio isn't being blasted straight into your ears then you blasted straight into your ears then you will find that the sound is a little bit will find that the sound is a little bit flat just doesn't sound quite right flat just doesn't sound quite right you've also now got an independent bass you've also now got an independent bass engine engine as well so you get slightly deeper as well so you get slightly deeper slightly louder slightly louder bass from these compared with previous bass from these compared with previous huawei free buds although huawei free buds although again true bassaholics ain't going to be again true bassaholics ain't going to be satisfied by these things you're going satisfied by these things you're going to want to get some proper over-ear to want to get some proper over-ear efforts to really enjoy your tracks efforts to really enjoy your tracks one of the features of the huawei 3.4 i one of the features of the huawei 3.4 i was most intrigued by was the active was most intrigued by was the active noise cancellation because of course i noise cancellation because of course i had been the free buds 4i had been the free buds 4i as well but the lack of silicone ceiling as well but the lack of silicone ceiling just meant that it just did nothing just meant that it just did nothing at all but while we reckons it's at all but while we reckons it's upgraded the anc you've now got two mics upgraded the anc you've now got two mics instead of just one instead of just one so how effective actually is it well i so how effective actually is it well i gotta admit i gotta admit i am impressed by the noise cancellation am impressed by the noise cancellation on the huawei 3 buds 4. i did notice a on the huawei 3 buds 4. i did notice a difference when i was walking down a difference when i was walking down a busy high street busy high street between having the anc off and the anc between having the anc off and the anc on turn the noise canceling on and the on turn the noise canceling on and the rumble of the traffic that's passing rumble of the traffic that's passing by definitely is dampened somewhat but by definitely is dampened somewhat but unfortunately once again because you unfortunately once again because you don't have don't have that proper seal you're still getting a that proper seal you're still getting a lot of that external noise invading your lot of that external noise invading your ears which is particularly annoying if ears which is particularly annoying if you're trying to listen to a podcast or you're trying to listen to a podcast or an audiobook where it's just people an audiobook where it's just people talking you have to concentrate really talking you have to concentrate really hard to try and hear what they're hard to try and hear what they're hearing i hearing i ended up bumping up the volume even with ended up bumping up the volume even with the anc on the anc on so yeah not great absolutely fine if so yeah not great absolutely fine if you're just listening to music but if you're just listening to music but if you like spoken word stuff it just you like spoken word stuff it just won't cut it in a busy environment so to won't cut it in a busy environment so to take last week for instance i had a good take last week for instance i had a good old-fashioned british beach holiday and old-fashioned british beach holiday and yes i'm gonna keep on mentioning that yes i'm gonna keep on mentioning that because because i'm just so giddy with excitement and i'm just so giddy with excitement and i've actually been on a beach i've actually been on a beach i had my buds in i was split on the sand i had my buds in i was split on the sand but instead of being able to enjoy the but instead of being able to enjoy the podcast i was trying to listen to all i podcast i was trying to listen to all i could hear was the chin smoking lady could hear was the chin smoking lady positioned just a few positioned just a few yards away oh ronnie ronnie where's yards away oh ronnie ronnie where's ronnie oh summer ronnie oh summer summer where's ronnie sama sama sama summer where's ronnie sama sama sama where's summer oh declan declan where's where's summer oh declan declan where's your sister your sister what we'll go get her out of the sea what we'll go get her out of the sea she's only bloody for she's only bloody for and go find ronnie will you oh he gaz and go find ronnie will you oh he gaz gaz gaz don't you feed that [ __ ] seagull don't you feed that [ __ ] seagull don't you [ __ ] dare i said don't you don't you [ __ ] dare i said don't you get get gaz gaz ah british holidays gaz gaz ah british holidays best in the world so in summary as far best in the world so in summary as far as the noise cancellation goes the three as the noise cancellation goes the three points four only really good if you want points four only really good if you want to just dampen the noise down a little to just dampen the noise down a little bit but still bit but still remain very much aware of what is going remain very much aware of what is going on in your environment and frankly i'd on in your environment and frankly i'd say say maybe just save yourself a little bit of maybe just save yourself a little bit of cash and get yourself something like the cash and get yourself something like the google pixel google pixel buds a series instead which costs 99 buds a series instead which costs 99 pounds don't have noise cancellation but pounds don't have noise cancellation but they do have a proper they do have a proper rubber sealy tip instead and it dampens rubber sealy tip instead and it dampens the the environment just as much thankfully i environment just as much thankfully i don't know if it's because of the dual don't know if it's because of the dual mic mic design now but the three buds for are design now but the three buds for are really good when you're making calls in really good when you're making calls in quite noisy environments the other quite noisy environments the other person at the other end of the line person at the other end of the line could still hear what was going on could still hear what was going on around me but you know it can pick up my around me but you know it can pick up my voice really really clearly so voice really really clearly so definitely good on that side of things definitely good on that side of things the only other disappointment with the the only other disappointment with the huawei freebirds 4 is the battery life huawei freebirds 4 is the battery life which offers around sort of four hours which offers around sort of four hours of use that's with the anc turned off of use that's with the anc turned off by the way before you'll need to pluck by the way before you'll need to pluck them from your ears them from your ears and stick them back in a handy little and stick them back in a handy little carry case carry case and yeah four hours is pretty poor and yeah four hours is pretty poor compared with a lot of rivals which tend compared with a lot of rivals which tend to offer around sort of five to six to offer around sort of five to six hours of use without any kind of noise hours of use without any kind of noise cancelling on the girlfriends as the cancelling on the girlfriends as the three buds pro three buds pro uh which were released last year they uh which were released last year they offer five hours offer five hours of use with that enc off thankfully the of use with that enc off thankfully the buds seem to charge buds seem to charge pretty quick once they're shoved away in pretty quick once they're shoved away in the carry case you get around four full the carry case you get around four full charges from the case itself as well charges from the case itself as well before that also needs before that also needs a bit of a recharge you can do that via a bit of a recharge you can do that via type c type c usb you do get the cable bundled in the usb you do get the cable bundled in the box everything and there will be a box everything and there will be a wireless charging version of the pixel wireless charging version of the pixel buds four case buds four case as well coming out apparently in around as well coming out apparently in around a sort of a month or two for a little a sort of a month or two for a little bit of extra cash bit of extra cash and like with the other three buds uh and like with the other three buds uh cases i really really cases i really really enjoy it really really nice and light enjoy it really really nice and light easy to slip into a pocket easy to slip into a pocket uh quite slimline as you can see there uh quite slimline as you can see there uh the only uh the only issue potentially is that again the lid issue potentially is that again the lid hinge feels a little bit hinge feels a little bit like you could snap off under pressure like you could snap off under pressure uh she's got to be careful with that uh she's got to be careful with that so right there's my full final review of so right there's my full final review of the huawei free buds for a decent pair the huawei free buds for a decent pair of true wireless earbuds definitely get of true wireless earbuds definitely get some nice premium features and some good some nice premium features and some good sound and audio uh for 130 pounds a lot sound and audio uh for 130 pounds a lot cheaper than some rivals but cheaper than some rivals but unfortunately the active noise unfortunately the active noise cancellation just doesn't cut it because cancellation just doesn't cut it because you don't get that proper you don't get that proper seal and the battery life isn't as seal and the battery life isn't as strong as many rivals strong as many rivals i've tested and reviewed tons of other i've tested and reviewed tons of other true wireless earbuds in 2021 go check true wireless earbuds in 2021 go check out my review of the google pixel out my review of the google pixel buzzer series which i did just a week or buzzer series which i did just a week or so ago really fantastic for 99 pounds so ago really fantastic for 99 pounds even though they don't have built-in anc even though they don't have built-in anc would be great to hear your own thoughts would be great to hear your own thoughts

everyone [Music] [Music] you you [Music] hey what's up bros it's fonte here i hope everybody's safe and healthy and in today's video i'm going to show you how to transfer data from your old phone to your new phone with harmony operation system but before we started please subscribe to my channel if you haven't already for more content like this thank you so much and now dive in so the first thing brothers you have to do is download the phone clone application if you have the huawei phone if the old phone is so from huawei there is no need to download phone clone if your old phone is from samsung or realme you have to go to app gallery not google play but uh uh epicurry entered from there download the phone clone application because uh in upgrade there is always the newest version so this is my huawei p40 pro plus this is the matrix two-way harmony os i will show you about phone and about phone here in my 11 android 10 harmony os and uh what i have to do if i want transfer all my applications from the old device to a new device it's very simple bro just go back system respectively settings about systemic update so and what to do so and to what to do if i ha and what to do if i want my favorite applications and games from the old phone what to do if i want my favorite games and applications from the huawei p40 pro plus on the new 4min harmony os it's a very simple brothers open settings on both devices and choose system and updates and now choose phone clone right here this is the old device this is the new device on the whole device i have to choose this is the old device of course if you open the phone clone for the first time the phone clone terms of service is displayed you have to choose agree and allow all necessary permissions the same here on the new device so i choose the old device on the old device and now on the new device i have to choose this is the new device brothers and the old device type the p40 pro plus uh with android 10 and emui 11 is of course the huawei so now i have to choose away device and now i have to it's uh with the all device i have to scan the qr code on the new device so i'm gonna do it now so now we have to wait uh until the connection is established okay and now the uh connection is successful and on the all device i can select which data i want to transfer so if i want uh transfer only gallery i deselect select all and check select all and scroll down uh generally check this box and i can now i can transfer only the gallery from the old phone to a new phone so i will show you on the i i checked uh the gallery now i have to tap on next brothers and transfer and now i have to wait until the operation is complete and the transfer is complete brothers i now i can tap on okay on the old device and finish on the new device and let's dive uh into gallery and the data uh from the old phone is here the uh for all photos very great the with what's uh pretty good about phone cone up is that you can do it multiple times and uh not only when you are sitting setting up your device so if you realize you are missing an application you can again go to a phone call on your device and go through the process again i will show you again settings on both devices system and updates again phone clone browsers phone chrome or both this is of course still the old device this is the new device this is uh my old phone is from huawei so i have to choose again huawei and again i have just uh the scanned query code okay and again we have to wait until the connection between this phone will be uh established okay and again we are here and all the old device on the p40 plus i can again select uh which data i want to transfer so again i uncheck either select all and this time go to applications i i and now i'm a real i realized that i won't transfer uh firefox application and gboard and facebook application so i select this free application tap on ok and tap on next and again transfer data and now i have to wait until the process is complete now it's importing facebook on the old device i can uh tap on okay but on the new device i still have to wait brothers as you can see some apps are not compatible and uh it shows me that there is some some issue so uh it's a transfer only firefox and facebook but it's cool again from clone now i will show you how to transfer only the data game settings browser system and updates this is the old phone new device again huawei and again scan the qr code and again we have to wait and again and this time uncheck this and i want to transfer some check applications uh for example these two apps and instagram tap on ok and next and transfer it's done on the old device on the new device we have still await by the way i really like this new harmony os animation do away a new animation very cool tap on finish ignore go back and uh we have here instagram ebc pizzazz so i have here the free applications i uh choose on the old device and now i have the apps on the new device on the matrix2 with a brand new harmony operation system so i do hope you ended up enjoying the video bros don't forget to subscribe like the video share the video and as always stay safe with the mask peace out i love you thank you so much [Applause] [Applause] you huawei's big and WC reveal that never was is this the mate pad Pro it's as much of an iPad pro contender as the company's mate book Pro was a MacBook Pro alternative infer what you want from that now this is why waste biggest attempt yet to establish a premium tablet range let's not forget the company has made middling and entry-level tablets for quite a while yes in fact like its smartphones though the company has decided to elevate its tablet efforts at a time when everything is either an iPad or a Windows 10 two in one and you know what hardware wise qua weight may have completely nailed it the name might already sound familiar that's because while we actually unveiled this device for China around the end of 2019 but with no news of taking it global now it's apparently ready to do so with a 5g titration for now let me get back to cooing over the hardware the mate Pad Pro is a ten point eight inch tablet that if it hasn't changed much from its Chinese interation weighs around 460 grams alike the similarly sized iPad pro it's got a gorgeous magnesium alloy frame with curved corners and while I only saw the most standard colors dark blue and white in person they're both stylish premium tablets there will also be a dark forest green and afterglow orange options too both with vegan leather back panels now since the iPhone 11 I've been drawn to gadgets with a green hue so I'm pretty excited even if vegan leather also translates in my brain to leatherette the main pad pros cellular and Wi-Fi antenna all molded directly to that tablet frame meaning there's no visible antenna lines there's also an 8 megapixel hole-punch camera on the front for conference calls more than selfies I hope and that's mirrored location wise by a rear-facing 13 megapixel camera with a 90 percent screen to body ratio than mate Pad Pro has a very thin bezel around the screen apparently 49 millimeters that's far smaller than the iPad pros border which measures over 80 mil now I'm not sure I care too much about that but there's certainly some engineering bragging rights there and if I haven't said it enough already it helps elevate the looks of this thing iPad baiting aside the screen itself is viv right up to 540 nets with a 2560 by 1600 resolution high enough to spit up tasks and apps on screen without making things tiny or blurry more on that later there's a seven thousand two hundred and fifty milliamp battery inside the tablet but the most interesting spec centers around the size and kinds of charging that this tablet can handle fast charging this time around can take in up to 40 watts while Huawei has really amped up wireless charging up to 27 watts if you have the appropriate wireless charger the tablet itself is a wireless charger to able to reverse charge compatible phones at 7.5 watts now that's typically what you get from most huginn Wireless charges and is pretty impressive because it's a flat ten point eight inch tablet it makes for a far more viable reverse charging surface than a phone of similar size it's a smart place to include this technology and you might actually use it more often than you do on your Samsung or huawei fo other things you might want to slap on to the mate Pad Pro how about a companion keyboard folio sold separately or perhaps the EM pen stylus also sold separately first the folio which feels like the iPad pros eye duration and that's a good thing I'll withhold judgment on how well extended typing sessions might feel but early impressions are good it passively powers itself from the tab and feels suitably premium to I'd say the M pen is more interesting however the peripheral is definitely the arch-nemesis of the Apple pencil but it has a cute hexagonal design like a staid allure pencil which is cute it magnetically attaches to the mate pad Pro and wisely charges itself to 30 seconds of charge equates to 10 minutes of use while we can expect 10 hours of scribbling on a full charge together these accessories pitch the mate pad pro as a more thought-out tablet on aims at productivity whether that means typing words or sketching plans it also makes it way more interesting than any tablet Huawei's made before when it comes to the software a new app multiplier feature is the standout idea allowing you to run two versions of several core apps including the web browser in a landscape arrangement the proportion of the screen dedicated to each app can be adjusted though the whole feature was pretty buggy at this demo Paige sometimes I had to close apps in order to get the arrangement of things I wanted there's certainly a knack to it if you're feeling particularly masochistic you could even throw a floating third window for calculations or other functions though oddly there's no floating note pad that aside it helps reinforce the multitasking pro vibe that worry is going for with this thing now like Huawei's updated foldable the mate XS the mate pad pro packs the company's own keyring 990 processor which includes the modem needed for 5g connections it means there's plenty of processing power - even if in these days of no Google Play there isn't really much of note to push mobile devices to their limits so about that app problem the company says there are now over a thousand apps supported on its devices but spokespeople wouldn't be drawn to announcing the whereabouts of go to mobile apps like uber which is still missing on Huawei phones if an app isn't on Hawaii's own App Store it means delving into things like Amazon's App Store side loading and other stuff that a lot of us power uses aside I know you're out there can't be bothered to do the main point is that Huawei still hasn't nailed the move from Android 10 as you know it to a OSP Android Open Source project it's been historically hard for Android tablets to go toe-to-toe with the iPad and for the mate pad Pro it's a point not even worth discussion if you're looking for a creative or productivity tablet then the optional extras can turn the mate pad pro into an impressive mobile work machine but if you want to consume media play games do stuff beyond web browsing the mate pad Pro doesn't look like it can satisfy those urges I'll wait for a review sample to change my mind [Music] good morning ladies and gentlemen welcome to my 
new channel don't forget to like and subscribe   and if you can support us on patreon that would 
be much appreciated so on with the show so today   i'm going to be talking about huawei and a lot of 
you may or may not know um the history of huawei   and what happened to them they've been hit badly 
by the trade sanctions uh by the united states   so trump at the time on may 15 2019 president 
trump at the time issued an executive order   that bans the use of telecommunications equipment 
from foreign firms deemed national security risk   so what that means is um huawei was put on 
an entity list which banned them from buying   um the latest semiconductor chips and huawei 
at the time uses used um their own chip which   was a five nanometer and and this was the chip in 
question the kirin 9000 chip and it was um a tiny   five nanometer chip with built-in 5g so huawei 
were at the time obviously who i was the first   company to bring out 5g and it was out selling 
apple phones in china and america felt threatened   really they saw huawei as a really up-and-coming 
technology company and they felt really threatened   that they would take a lot of business um 
not only from america but also from the world   so what did the us do as a result well basically 
they put huawei on the entity list which basically   meant that any equipment from foreign 
firms deemed a national security risk   would be an issue um so they banned huawei from 
the us and they also banned a lot of companies   from dealing with huawei and especially selling 
those five nanometer chips um the company which   provided them the five nanometer chips was 
um tsmc and so they stopped supplying them   um the five nanometer chips not only that but us 
also campaigned for a lot of its allies to stop   working with huawei around the world so a lot of 
countries like uk australia a few countries from   europe stopped working with huawei or bandwa 
away from their 5g network and not only that   um on sunday may 19th google publicly declared 
they would be complying with trump's huawei ban   interpreting the language of the order google 
determined that the proper course of action would   be to cut hua away from google suite of digital 
products so basically that meant that huawei was   no longer be able to access um the android 
smartphones like gmail youtube google drive   google play store which were not not no longer 
available for for huawei so this basically   set a precedence and he sends shockwaves around 
the world really that america can force a lot of   technology companies to stop working from with 
huawei and it sends shockwaves around china as   well that you know if you're a company and you're 
reliant on american technology or products that   you could be literally cut off overnight 
and um and yeah people were shocked while   the executives in huawei were obviously shocked 
all of china was shocked but the whole world was   shocked as well then and it could basically 
happen to anyone if you're a company which   starts competing with apple or doing really well 
american can literally cut you off in a second   so it was a big shock for everyone um to be 
honest at the time so how has huawei been   doing since the ban um took place um they did 
buy a lot of um curing chips before the ban   took effect so they did stockpile a lot of 
chips but obviously that's only a limited number   their profit as you can see has gone up 
but the revenue has been going down um   i'm not gonna lie they are taking a big hit um 
last year uh huawei's revenue stood up 891.4   billion won that is 135 billion us dollars up 3.8 
year on year while net profits rose 3.2 percent   to 64. 64.6 billion won so that's taken in effect 
selling a lot of phones which were stockpiled so   they've been stockpiling a lot of chips and 
products um with u.s technology last year but   obviously that's probably going to be running out 
this year so they are kind of um probably looking   to take a big hit over the next few years uh i 
believe so things are not looking that well um   so what's what are we doing in the meantime 
what's um and and as you can see from this   article after two years of us ban huawei further 
speeds up its self rescue so what was what we've   been doing so one of the first things that huawei 
has done is move away from google play store and   google products so they've released their 
own operating system called harmony os   and that's going to be released on their 
smartphones and internet of things as well as   things like huawei watches and other products that 
they're releasing so what is harmony os and how   is it different from from google well here are 
the main differences so harmony os is based   on an open source operating system open source 
software and i believe it's based on linux which   is the same as android so that's what a lot of 
people are saying is very similar to android but   it's not exactly android but it's based on the 
same open source um software that android uses   so the main advantage harmony os has over 
ios and android is that it can be mounted on   many iot devices like tv cars smart home 
appliances iot are internet of things and   this year in the next few years we're going to 
see a boom of internet of things so you're going   to see a millions and millions of devices which 
are accessible to the internet which will be smart   devices and a lot of people would be wanting 
to link all of that to their phones so that's   where huawei comes in really so they'll be able 
to provide um their harmony os operating system   linked to to phones to cars smart home appliances 
tv etc and there is a huge huge market for that   and the difference between ios and android is ios 
is purely designed for phones um unless you know   if you own an apple product this is very difficult 
to get apple um linked to other things like tv   cars fridges you know unless you buy an apple 
fridge apple car you know it's very it's very   difficult um you only limit it to phones and 
maybe laptops and things like that but harmony   would be able to link up millions of devices that 
use internet of things so that's a good advantage   um growth area iot devices have got great 
potential as as you can see we have we are   having a huge boom of iot devices happening 
over the next few years and and that's just   going to grow and grow um so how how harmony 
os has got a huge potential in that growth area   advantages is open source um meaning 
that developers can create apps on it   um it's not that difficult um like is on ios 
um what huawei has been doing is is promoting   their harmony os with many developers they've 
been creating developer hubs all over the world   and also from this article here you can 
see already app gallery is is their um   google play store version of of the product so 
as you can see as of march 2021 um app gallery   has over 530 million active users 83 yearly 
increase in app distribution and also you can   see is there's active users on 700 million huawei 
devices as of third quarter of 2020 app galleries   reached 350 billion app downloads as of 2020 app 
gallery has 490 billion users in 170 countries   and nearly 1.6 million developers so you can see 
it is growing um it's going to take time to beat   android and apple obviously things take time but 
it's a start really and and i can see why we're   really pushing this because they've got no choice 
um they've got no choice um they can't use google   products so they are actively pushing this and um 
and i think they will be successful um the other   other advantage is um is baidu maps and baidu is 
there is chinese versions of gps so baidu has got   his own satellite and it's actually more accurate 
than gps as well um so one of the things google   google uses is gps and gps is obviously an 
american satellite so imagine if you're a   technology company and google cuts you off from 
gps and you'll be screwed really um so this way   china has got his own chinese satellite 
which americans have no control over so   so it kind of gives you that self-dependency 
as well so one of the things that this has um   caused is self-dependency across all of um 
china really and a lot of companies want to   become self-sufficient use chinese products they 
want to rely less and less on american products   because one day america might do to you what 
they did to huawei so that's one of the things um   and also i want to talk about this article here 
um so it says here if any company can create a   true rival to android on ios it's huawei and this 
is because huawei has got a huge huge fan base in   china and as you know there's 1.4 billion people 
in china so if they release a huawei os in china   um they can easily be successful and and one 
of the things it is an open source software and   they which also means other 
chinese companies like uh vevo and   or oppo they can use the huawei um operating 
system as well in the future so they can   go from google to huawei and i believe 
they will do actually because um   the less reliant a chinese company is to us the 
better is for a chinese company and what maybe   oppo or army can do is maybe have um huawei os 
only for china and but if they go to if they're   selling their phones abroad to kind of america or 
europe they can have their android google so they   can have two versions of it and even that you even 
doing that is great um business sense for for the   company but also it's going to be great for the 
huawei's operating system and also great for china   google definitely should be worried about all of 
this and and if harmony os is successful which i   believe it will be um if you look at the chinese 
market itself you've got 1.4 billion people   and if other phone companies like 
vivo oppo and rami start taking in   using huawei os then definitely google 
should be very worried that's going to be   half the income gone if chinese companies start 
using harmony os so he so yeah google should be   very worried other things huawei has been doing 
to diversify his business is they're launching   um some cloud products and and that's 
another big thing huawei's been doing and   at the moment in china um you can see here in 
the fourth quarter of 2020 uh huawei cloud became   the second largest player in china with 17.4 
percent market share alibaba was the biggest   and with tencent cloud as um as a third so you 
can see the cloud business is a huge huge um   up and coming business uh and there's 
more more companies using cloud   and i believe it's a huge huge um money maker 
there for huawei to get involved with cloud   um obviously amazon aws and google they also offer 
their own cloud services but i think with them   with the amount of companies and amount of market 
share in um in china uh i think huawei should do   pretty well other things huawei is investing on 
is um smart evs so right now they're not producing   cars but they are producing the software that 
goes into cars so and they're also doing all the   autonomous driving and things like 
that and and you can see here that huawei has reached level four a level that tesla 
has not even reached so that's another thing that   kind of huawei can branch out in in evs and as you 
know the ev sector is a huge sector that's going   to be it's pretty much booming right now it's 
going to boom even more over the next few years   as cars goes goes from combustion engines to 
electrical engines and if huawei provides software   to you know many different car brands that's a big 
you know investment and that's a big kind of money   maker there um and also uh huawei's developing 
is 6g technology as well so that's gonna   get the front lines to develop the 60 and i think 
that's going to be coming up in the next few years   as well they're already doing the tests on 6g so 
what's my thoughts guys i think i think what's   happened to huawei is is a good thing and people 
might say why is a good thing because i think it's   kind of taught huawei that you know first of all 
they shouldn't be reliant on american technology   and american products and secondly what he's done 
is help the company to diversify his products   um while before a couple of years ago before the 
band they were purely focusing on the smartphones   and they had obviously two smartphones at the 
time they had the high-end brand they had the   honor brand as well which was a low-end smartphone 
and and they were also kind of focusing on their   5g but right now huawei is focusing on many many 
different areas they're looking at evs they're   looking at cloud computing they've got their own 
operating system and they'll have a huge amount   of iot devices coming out over the next few years 
and plus they're also doing a lot of things like   smart mining whether you have 5g automated 
mining and and loads and loads of other   products and and they are diversifying and 
they've learned a huge lesson uh from this um   episode that not to rely on us you know they need 
to kind of focus on their own domestic um brands   and things like that and and huawei has also kind 
of become a hero in china in terms of like you   know china has changed its whole strategy because 
of what's happened in huawei uh and huawei took a   hit for all of china and because while we took the 
hit all the companies in in china are diversifying   their suppliers and and a lot of them are going 
away from american in products and american   businesses and focusing on homegrown talent 
and home local talent and that's just going   to affect american businesses in the long term if 
all the chinese companies are start diversifying   uh you know in in their homeland and that's just 
going to affect american businesses so there's   there'll be less money american businesses 
will be able to make from chinese companies   as chinese companies are going to be focusing on 
local brands and and homemade products so that's   the good thing i mean going forward huawei i 
believe over the next few years they will probably   make less and less profits um their smartphone 
business is pretty much gone down the pan um   so they can't create another smartphone unless 
they find a way to create five nanometer chips   which which i don't think they will of the next 
few years unless china is able to create its own   five nanometers and then huawei would be able to 
go back to his phone business but in the meantime   i think what huawei will do is focus on 6g 
focus on its own operating system focus on iot   focus on cloud computing and by 
the time china and if you know   if there is a chance that china can produce 
its own semiconductors in next few years   and they can't create their own five nanometers or 
the trade war ends and you know huawei is back on   um united states good books and they can start you 
know producing their own chips and and get other   companies to manufacture their chips then then 
things might start looking good for huawei but um   that's looking unlikely at the moment i think the 
huawei's best bet is for china to graze own chips   and they are you know they are going well and 
i'm going to give an update on on the chip market   in another video as well but i think you know 
going forward um is good for huawei to diversify   and another thing if huawei do develop this 
harmony os you'll be great for china because   they will have an operating system that they can 
manage and control and not rely on apple or google   um because a lot of issues regarding data i mean 
where where is all this data going to be held   if it's in apple or if it's google you know if 
harmony os you know the guarantee all that data   would be kept in-house and that data would be 
required for artificial intelligence and and   artificial intelligence is the major thing at the 
moment and if huawei wants to survive as a company   they have to incorporate a lot more artificial 
intelligence and the only way they will do that   is to gather the data and imagine the amount of 
data they can gather from harmony os if it's in   all these iot devices and smartphones and cars 
and tv imagine all of that data and how much more   powerful huawei would be in terms of artificial 
intelligence because one of the things you need   for artificial intelligence is data you need a 
lot of a lot of data um so so that's one thing um   that huawei would have a benefit and i think 
going forward guys i mean yeah look their   smartphone business might not do as well um over 
the next few years even if china finds a way to do   five nanometers you know you've got tsmc who are 
releasing three nanometers and two nanometers even   one nanometer they'll still be far behind unless 
they can get tsmc to manufacture these products   for them um the only way china will be able to or 
huawei be able to do smartphones and and compete   with apple is if china managed to have its own 
semiconductor market by itself and able to catch   up with tsmc and all these other companies that's 
the only way while we would be able to survive   with their smartphone but i think the smartphone 
they have at the moment um the mate and the   foldable ones is pretty good even though it's five 
nanometers so i think they can um you know even if   china managed to make five nanometers in 
foreseeable future they can carry on with   that brand um and and but they can obviously their 
strength lies in diversity and cloud computing   and harmony os and iot devices and and they 
are in the leading line for 6g as well so once   6g is ready they are pretty much they're pretty 
much ready with 6g now but i think they're going   to wait uh 10 years and by 10 years guys you know 
china's economy would be number one and they would   be able to overtake american economy and china 
at that point would have a lot more say in what's   happening around the world so a lot of um so 
right now america's got the power they can tell   companies like asml do not sell to china otherwise 
you know will blacklist you will sanction you but   if china becomes number one you know they 
can say to asml look guys we're number one   you know you don't want to lose our market 
america's on its way down we're on our way up   um sell us your euv machines um so things might 
change in like you know in eight or ten years   asmr might decide say screw america and you know 
start selling to a bigger market which is china   and imagine all these semiconductor companies 
in china who have started you know this year   and last year imagine there's hundreds and 
thousands of these semiconductor companies and   if asmr suddenly decides to sell to china 
just just imagine the market and literally   asml would be the biggest company company 
on earth for the amount of duv and euv   machines they will be able to sell to china they 
can't they can't say no to that and you know once   china becomes number one by 2030 well it will also 
release 6g while we would be in a much much better   position um as a company they would be hugely 
diversified um america won't be able to sanction   them in any way because their diversification 
you know is based on local uh products local um   suppliers and stuff and huawei would be in a 
much better position in 10 years and when 6g   takes off and all of huawei's products take off 
and you know if things go well if china managed   to catch up with american some semiconductors 
or asml decides to sell china its machines then   china will be a much better better position 
and whoa we'll be in a better position and   final conclusions guys i mean all of this that has 
happened to huawei huawei has taken a big hit for   china and it's made china realize that they needs 
to be self-sufficient sufficient he can't rely on   america and this happening to huawei has done them 
a lot of good in china they are very much well   respected their name is very much well respected 
and huawei will always be there the government   will always protect them government will sub 
subsidize them they're not going to let them fall   they're not going to let them go out of business 
and and the people of china will always support   huawei so whenever you know huawei is ready with 
its 6g and it starts releasing 6g phones i'm sure   they will come back in a much stronger position 
and america won't be able to do anything to them   so that's um that's my final thoughts about huawei 
let me know what your thoughts are and we'll chat   on the comments don't forget to like and subscribe 
and support me in patreon if you can thank you bye [Music] hello everyone my name is julin chen i'm the co-founder and ceo of elf blockchain technology today i would like to share with you how health together with huawei cloud can help your organization to capture the new values in the digitalized world i will first start to talk about how technology has been helping to grow the economy [Music] throughout the human history we have seen technology to help people to move around so that started with cars airplanes and ships and moving forward we start to see new technology to help information to be created seamlessly and at low cost and also being transmitted to every single corner of the world and that has opened up the business of internet and moving even further into that finance and fintech companies has been trying even further to make assets and values to move freely and also being exchanged and transacted and more efficiently blockchain is here to help institutions to make assets and values to be exchanged created and transacted in a more efficient and secure weight it has a ledger that cannot be hacked and it records every single transaction the smart contract allows any transactions to be executed in a predefined way and a transparent way and the incentive system comes with blockchain allows companies to even work with customers that they never worked before and even build a ecosystem that includes more partners and can expand globally so that is the beauty of blockchain [Music] blockchain has come a long way for the past 10 years it first emerged as a single use case called bitcoin which is a global money that was created not by any single country or any business entities but still being accepted and traded by all the people in the world and moving forward we start to introduce a new technology on blockchain called smart contract which is invented by ethereum so ethereum become the programmable global money that allows money to be transacted in even more ways and also can be custodian without any middleman and that really opens up to many more possibilities for business especially for financial institutions so that's where the third generation of blockchain such as elf is really trying to create an internet of value where smart contracts can be more generic to fulfill any kinds of business needs and also it is future proof that can allow any institutions to use it at ease so it really makes blockchain as part of the digitalization journey for institutions we have seen many use cases that has started with financial institutions blockchain being one of the key technology enablers to make those things happen recently we have seen the news that a few countries central banks have started to experiment digital currencies in their own society such as china and also singapore government [Music] we have also seen cross-border transactions empowered by blockchain to really make forex and also money remittance to happen at much cheaper cost and we're very happy to hear cases like velo lab is trying to make that happen in thailand with other countries and without saying that there are even more use cases happening on financial services with so many use cases happening companies has been leveraging the key features of blockchain to create values so those are trustless immutability and also borderless blockchain has replaced the needs of middlemen for any business to happen so you could work with other institutions or customers without any trust to be built at the very beginning this is super crucial for high frequency trading and any financial transactions the immutability of all the past records recorded on a blockchain also makes it more hack proof and people can use it at peace and the technology itself provides a outreach that companies can provide the service to people in other countries and also can incentivize new partners at every corner of the world so with these three key features a lot of companies has been using it to improve the efficiencies of their existing business for example blockchain has been driving down the cost of cross-border remittance but more interestingly by replacing or getting rid of the middleman companies has been envisioning a new value chain where they can capture more values or moving up or downwards to work on more stuff and thirdly with internet being more prominent in the whole world and our consumers be more and more comfortable of using digital assets and digital identity it also provides new business opportunities and brand new business models for financial institutions to serve the new digital demographics in the world and that is definitely the future so blockchain is really more than a technology it is part of the journey that helps institutions to go beyond automation and digitalization and move into more of a value-driven business model empowered by blockchain so it will be part of the grand idea and digital transformation and it will be one of the core part a lot of enterprises has been interested in this and how can we actually go through the journey so based on a survey conducted together between elf and global consultancy rollenberger we have interviewed many executives around the world a lot of them agreed that financial institutions need to embrace blockchain and secondly they also think that they want to take more of a controlled measure to start with something not public but rather a consulting blockchain and lastly they also agreed that they are looking for partners not just to provide a future-proof blockchain but also can help them to explore new applications on top of blockchain so that's where we are we're here to introduce elf as the one stop solution for your institution to embrace blockchain fully health provides a world-class engineered blockchain that is future proof we offer you the product so you do not have to worry about blockchain to be absolute and it comes with all the modern technology that suits your institution's need secondly running the blockchain in your institution is as easy as running any cloud applications we can launch elf blockchain in your institution within 15 minutes and you can customize it based on your needs so your organization fully owns that blockchain and together with cloud of service providers like huawei we could scale up the blockchain itself depending on how big your blockchain business is and to serve your customer base so that provides a cost saving and also a scalability that fits the growth of your business and along the way we're offering more and more applications on huawei cloud so that you could see how other companies are using blockchain to innovate and serve their customers and we are happy to help you on that journey health blockchain is one of the most innovative and well engineered product in the market we are the first one to introduce parallel processing capability on a blockchain and that leads to a processing and storage capability that is as efficient as central server which will make your organization feel painless in using it to serve your customers we also introduced a innovative cross-chain capability so that your application will not work in silo but rather being able to work with any other applications available in the market and you can tap into those customer base as well elf blockchain is built with a modular architecture so that it's super easy to maintain and also customize based on your institution's needs and also we keep the developers experience at the core of our mission so we try to make that as easy as possible and provide all the needed necessary documentations and tools for your technology team to work on [Music] we have been on the front line of setting standards in the industry we are publishing a standard in digital asset identification at ieee with a few other well-known institutions we believe by having a standard in the industry this will help companies to more easily bring assets onto blockchain and this will define what data will be needed and how those assets shall be formed on a blockchain as most companies are moving in their business onto cloud we build elf blockchain fully on cloud as well launching of blockchain on your cloud is painless you could easily find it on the huawei cloud marketplace and launch it using huawei cloud within 15 minutes so in this way you don't really feel any pain and rather just launch a new software from huawei cloud and we don't stop right there we give your institution the capability to customize that blockchain based on your needs we know institutions sometimes may want to change how the consensus to be reached or they may want to define whether this is going to be a private chain or consodium chain with a few partners to start with and also to minimize the risks of exposing it to the public so our blockchain allows you to change all those and you just need to change any modules that you would like to customize and all those things can be done very easily with the help of huawei cloud once your organization has more comfort running the blockchain at your institution you may want to even open it up to work with more partners in the future or to work with other blockchains in the market and that has been done by us we provide a cross-chain communication mechanism that allows you to interact with all the famous blockchains such as bitcoin ethereum and also any other applications or side chains that are using elf technology so we want to break the silos of all the different chains and let the values to flow across different businesses for example financial institutions could potentially work with digital identity companies on blockchain and also credit scoring companies so that each of the partners can focus on the specific application they're using one of the key innovation that elf has brought into this industry is we're the only blockchain that is capable of processing transactions in parallel so we achieve that by smartly groups different transactions into independent categories and with the help of cloud service capability we could allow them to be processed at the same time and without endangering any securities this means that we are making blockchain from a single core cpu to a multi-core cpu capability and that will significantly improve the performance of blockchain and our whole technology is built to support all the capabilities of cloud service we separate the blockchain data storage and computation into different components so that each component can be done by a cluster of computers provided by cloud servers and this is also the first time that a blockchain can achieve that and this means that the blockchain fully embraces what cloud service can provide which is to scale up and scale down based on your business need and depending on what stage your organization is we can also tailor a blockchain with cloud server that matches the transaction speed you need so we have really provide a blockchain that is future proof and also scalable enough to meet your business needs we do not stop from there we provide you the architecture and the fundamental technology but also we work hand-in-hand with our customers to identify what is the business opportunity and what kind of business applications they shall use on blockchain we've been working with various clients in financial industry to look at many interesting topics a few interesting ones include how to make loyalty points on blockchain so that it can move freely not just within the organization but also much easier to work with other partners outside of its ecosystem we're also helping gift card exchanges to see what it will be a better way to digitalize gift cards to make them transferred more securely to avoid fraud and also to make the whole exchange transactions more efficient and we are also looking at trustless custodian for digital assets tokenized assets and cross-border remittance and more our goal is really to help our clients to succeed in their own business we've been working with a client in southeast asia to look at introduce a loyalty point into their current business their current system does not have a loyalty point system that can work securely and also allows other partners to join their ecosystem so by introducing a loyalty point they can significantly increase the retention rate of their customers and also potentially to allow cross cross sale and upsell of other products they're offering to their clients with blockchain system it naturally has a very secure and efficient transaction system that can process loyalty points at high volume and we have designed architecture with a client so that the blockchain itself provides the the settling capability at the back end and together with the application at the front end their users are gonna hardly feel that this is running on blockchain but still enjoying all the benefits that brings in and the clients partners are also happy that the system brings in transparency in the whole loyalty points settlement and we are happy to work with amaton which is the largest gift card exchange in japan to envision what amateur 2.0 would be like on blockchain amarton has been serving its clients to facilitate physical gift cards exchange and trading for the past five years and it captures over 40 percent of the market in japan by working with elf blockchain amaton tech team has been envisioning the new ways of issue issuing gift cards and the efficient ways of allowing those digitalized gift cards to be transacted and redeemed and traded [Music] this would significantly change how merchants would issue gift cards and also reduced the cost of issuing cards and more importantly this would significantly reduce the number of frauds associated with gift cards to help the customers [Music] and amarton is also leveraging the elf blockchain technology to look at how to expand its business beyond the japanese market so both of us are super excited about this great opportunity to make physical gift cards fully on blockchain and leverages all the benefits of blockchain to reduce frauds and increase efficiency and improve customer user experience [Music] yeah so in a nutshell elf blockchain company is here to help our clients together with huawei to really identify what would be the new business opportunities for them to launch blockchain and also we are ready to run pilots and proof of concepts with enterprises to showcase how blockchain can really help these institutions and ultimately with all the tools and the supports we can provide and all the applications we're building along the way we believe those can help the institutions to launch tailored applications based on their own business needs that's all for today thank you very much for your time we're really excited about all the business opportunities that blockchain unleashed for financial institutions and we are here to provide you the technology and also the know-hows to walk through the transformation journey together and reach the new digital opportunities together thank you [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] welcome to the launch event of huawei harmonyos and our new hardware products over the last decade huawei has transformed into a consumer brand we have grown from an unknown player to become a premium brand that is both loved and trusted by consumers in the last decade huawei has introduced groundbreaking innovations and technologies to smartphones we have long been a leader in smartphone photography and videography and encouraged evolution from 3g to 4g and later 5g in addition huawei has addressed the frustration of android phones slowing down over time and made new experiences possible longer battery life fast charging technology new materials and new techniques have all been introduced to smartphones in recent years huawei has been a pioneer in affordable smartphone market we have also established a presence in the pc market enabling seamless collaboration between smartphones and pcs to enhance productivity hover vision our smart tv packs ai technologies which bring consumer experiences to new heights people today care deeply about their health this is where huawei's smart watches and bands come in which help consumers to monitor their sleep and workouts our smartwatch's two-week battery life brings value to the industry today more consumers than ever are using tws headphones huawei has brought incredible sound quality and noise cancellation to its own open fit earphones in many domains huawei has been working to make this dream come true the philosophy of huawei's consumer business group is make it possible we're aspired to make the impossible possible bringing the ultimate experience to consumers over the next decade a long-term strategy of our consumer business shall be seen as ai life we plan to target five areas finish and health smart office entertainment smart home and easy travel today we'll present the new harmony os let's recap the journey of operating systems in the 1980s the first personal computers appeared which used the first dos and later windows then since 2000 in the smartphone era we saw the emergence of symbia ios and android what kind of era are we in today we're now about to enter a new era where everything will be connected and intelligent however consumer experience is not ready for the new era it's quite complex to connect and control devices and experiences on different devices vary what we have today is an operating system for smartphones an operating system for tablets an operating system for smart watches and multiple systems perhaps for vehicles in a new era the many iot devices have limited ram and processing power yet it is essential they have longer battery life if different devices run on different systems the ecosystems and the experiences will be fragmented this is why we develop harmony os [Music] [Music] this is our harmony os which can support different types of devices it can be integrated with fiber vision smart watches tablets smartphones and head units more importantly it can also be introduced to iot devices such as cameras household appliances power sockets and lamps homie os is here to help it will support a wide range of devices in an era where everything is intelligent harmony os one is all always one all as one now i'd like to invite the president of huawei consumer business software department dr wong chan loo to provide more information about harmony os dr wang welcome thank you richard ladies and gentlemen hello it is my pleasure to announce the launch of harmony os today five years ago when we first started designing harmony os we decided to adopt the full stack decoupled architecture our goal is to use one set of code to satisfy the demands of different devices whether big or small that's the principle of harmony os today we can use how many os for smartphones and watches and it can even be implemented on devices with as little as 128 kb of ram i don't think any other operating system in the world is capable of that we know that the connection of devices is fundamental to the iot era we have pioneered distributed technology to make connections effortless the these of the bus connects devices and the these of the bus serves as a highway between them this allows consumers to actually assemble the capabilities of different hardware based on their own needs what does this mean you may still remember how smartphones replace the feature phones the hardware didn't change much but only smartphone consumers are able to choose the apps they need in other words in a smartphone era consumers can assemble different software based on their demands today the harmony os brings a new innovation is these of the bus allows consumers to assemble different hardware based on their needs just imagine you are trying to film something from different angles but you only have your phone but with the d softbox you can link a drone or an action camera with your smartphone then from your smartphone you can control the cameras of other devices to capture multiple angles these devices form one super device through the multi-cam mode we can also use these of the bus to connect the tablet pc farmer vision and smartphone for productivity for example you can use actually a stylus of a tablet to work on a file on your pc and you can also easily access materials saving your phone from your pc and then add it as an attachment in an email there are still many more possibilities for us to explore no matter how many devices are connected we want to ensure that consumers can use them as easily as if they were using just one device therefore today we're also introducing harmony os control panel [Music] [Music] [Music] the harmony os control panel allows users to easily manage services on our device and control the devices connected to that device this enables the easy creation of super devices by connecting multiple devices together for example using the music widget on the control panel you can choose how you want to play your music if you have multiple music streaming apps you can use the widget to choose your preferred app with the same widget you can also select which device plays the music such as a pair of headphones speaker huawei vision or smartphone similarly using the control panel you can manage wifi and bluetooth connections without needing to access your device settings what's more the control panel will show you the status of all devices connected to your phone with widgets this means the control panel serves as a unified portal consumers can check on the status of devices connected to their phones and control these devices a unified portal for our consumers the control panel can also do so much more one of the biggest differentiator of harmony os is his ability to combine the capabilities of hardware and create one super device in the past devices had to be connected via complex cables or often through complex operations but now at the control panel you can simply tap on the super device widget and you will see the phone icon encircled by the icons of other devices to connect my phone with one of the devices i simply drag the device icon to my phone icon this operation is so much easier than the existing solutions and i believe it will be quickly pick up by consumers this intuitive experience is powered by sophisticated technologies traditionally for two devices to connect they must go through multiple steps including discovery pairing authentication and connecting again with all these steps done can the two devices be connected connecting device is incredibly easy and devices can combine to form one super device so what kind of new experiences can we expect let me walk you through some use cases when you're listening to music on your phone your phone speaker may only have mediocre sound quality if there is a speaker close by you can simply go to the super device widget and drag icons to connect the speaker and the phone now you can enjoy your music through the speaker's superior sound quality similarly just drag the speaker icon to your smartphone icon and the music will now go to smart tv a smart tv in your living room certainly presents a more immersed experience than a smartphone another possibility is that you're watching a movie or video on your huawei vision it's already late and your whole family has gone to bed the last thing you want to do is wake them up but you still want to finish the video just drag the earphone icon to the smartphone icon and as earphones the smartphone and java vision will start functioning as one super device these options give consumers an experience that would have never been possible with just a single device we have made such an experience possible by implementing advanced technologies two technologies in particular have been adopted to ensure the images and sounds stay in sync the first is the soft clock synchronization the second technology addresses the challenge of interference high interference causes jittering increased lag and higher packet loss we have to guarantee that a me time call can transfer from the phone to the tv using the camera the larger screen bigger speakers and superior microphone look forward to seeing more creative applications and throughout lives when you're creating you might be using a tablet what if you need an image from your phone traditionally this can be quite a hassle first you might need to establish a link between your tablet and phone you may then have to use an app to transfer the file from the phone to tablet but this is all much easier with harmony os we can just drag to connect the smartphone and the tablet after they have become one super device you can just drag the desired image from the phone straight onto the file you're working on on the tablet if a phone and tablet can form one super device can a pc and a smartphone do the same of course a simple drag will do the trick most pcs runs on windows but the smartphones can run on harmony os the reasons the two operating systems can collaborate is because we have implemented a harmony os plugin all at an attachment which is a file on my phone to achieve this i simply click on the drive icon of my phone on the pc locate the file and add it as an attachment or if i'm trying to share a content to my friend via an instant messaging app the content is on my pc then i can just drag the content and drop it to the messaging app on my phone and that's done on my pc i found a great picture and i wanted to be saved on my phone i can just combine my phone and pc as one super device and just right click choose save fast and select the drive icon of the phone the distributor capabilities of harmony os allows consumers to combine devices to form super devices it will have unlimited applications foreign [Music] [Music] household appliances are now entering people's lives for example kitchen appliances and other home gadgets are becoming increasingly intelligent however many of their smart features are never accessed by consumers why is that because most household appliances require consumers to download corresponding apps in order to control them we all know that apps can be tens of and even hundreds of gigabytes in size the process of downloading installing and registering often discourages consumers and after consumers have downloaded an app they have to find a function they want and usually they will have to wade through different layers of app manual this also discourages consumers less than ten percent of smart appliance owners have installed the corresponding apps and among those who have installed the apps less than five percent actually use the smart features but with how many of us accessing smart features is so much easier let me show you the kind of experience we can expect from homeos-powered household appliances we want to make it easy to set up connections within the harmony os ecosystem so that consumers can access smart features more easily how do we connect two harmony os devices we simply tap the phone against another harmony aerospace device such as an oven this one tap establishes the connection and then after that the user can access to all smart features through the widget for example here in the recipe widget we found something we like we can simply follow the recipe instructions and place all ingredients in the oven then tap to start cooking all you need to do now is wait i think this will be immensely helpful for people who lead a busy life household appliances are more than just machines they are capable of providing services to make our lives easier ingredients are key to amazing cuisine due to the life we lead many of us will probably make food purchases for the next week and then shift everything into the refrigerator how can we prevent the nutrition of the food from being lost this concern is also addressed by harmony os just have the phone against a harmony os powered refrigerator then you will see the widget for smart temperature control and you will be shown that the best temperatures to preserve their food such as a salmon fish sashimi in this case you probably want the temperatures that to stay at -3 degrees celsius then you just need to tap your foam to set the perfect temperature chinese people love drinking soul milk and multi-grain drinks but different people may need to take their beverages differently today soul milk producers cannot customize their drink for individuals and few consumers know what kind of drink their body needs how many of us is here to help remember which uses consent to access data from the huawei health app the drink maker will assess your house and even based on the assessment the drink maker can recommend the right drinks for you i think this is the kind of seamless ai life we are all looking forward to we're we're not dealing with machines instead we're enjoying the services of a dietitian who constantly helps to improve our health and diet 10th of september last year how many os was made available to partners and we're very grateful for all their support more and more partners have joined us in the harmony os ecosystem including appliance brands solution developers and module manufacturers after seeing the different use cases i think consumers should have some idea about how the control panel of harmony os can meaningfully help in their lives the control panel allows consumers to control not just the device in their hand but other gadgets connected to that device more importantly it is a portal for consumers to create super devices thanks to the distributed capabilities of harmony os the control panel is available on smartphones smart watches and tablets we hope that all devices with screens in the harmony os ecosystem will support the control panel allowing consumers to easily use and control the devices they own [Music] okay [Music] [Applause] [Music] say hello now i'd like to show you more features of harmony os consumers today are accessing services through the apps they've downloaded they are very powerful on our smartphones consumers can easily access information and digital services through apps and connect with your friends and family but when there are more devices coming to our life accessing services with apps only might face certain limitations this was also one of the frustrations we try to address when designing harmony os even if multiple devices are combined to function as one super device we still want to make sure app developers can develop the same can deploy the same code on different hardware this is the distributed application framework provided by harmony os the distributed application framework together with atomic services can make that a reality now i'd like to show you how mios home screen as long as apps are adapted with the harmony os distributed capability and atomic services you can simply swipe up on an app icon on the harmony os home screen these will display the app's key information to the user on the harmony os home screen atomic services are delivered through service widgets for example if certain information is important to you and you want to see it all the time without having to unlock the phone and open an app to do this i can simply pin the information on the home screen like a sticky note based on their demands consumers can define different screens for different scenarios they can have a screen for productivity a screen for entertainment and another screen perhaps for fitness and health harmony os home screen also offers another helpful feature when you put two apps into the same folder the home screen will remind you if there are also other apps of the same type just tap to confirm and then all related apps will be put into the same folder and what's more the folder can be expanded to a smart folder with one tab a smart folder displays the thumbnails of app icons allowing users to easily see which apps are in the folder without having to tap on the folder to find out they can also open an app by tapping on its thumbnail thanks to the distributed capabilities of harmony os the service widgets are also available on smartphones smart watches tablets and hover vision i would also like to unveil another amazing feature typically consumers today download apps on their phones to access services that's very normal but when i'm not on my phone but want to access the same service on another device it's virtually impossible but harmony os makes it possible let me show you how exactly harmony os is helping to dissolve the boundaries between physical devices and allow services to flow between them let's say we have a smartphone and a tablet when they have merged into one super device the task center will show the ongoing tasks on both devices if i'd like to move a task from my phone to the tablet i just need to swipe it like that and it goes onto the tablet i can also check on the running apps on my phone from my tablet i might want one of them to run on my tablet just one tap and it's done this kind of amazing experience is unimaginable in any of the existing ecosystem out there it's very simple and convenient in the harmony os ecosystem the super device capability of harmony os can transfer a service to the device that most suits a user if you are cycling the workout app can move to your tablet apps can also flow onto public vision each of these operations only required a simple tap and drag let's take a look at the experience with huawei me time hovering me time is based on the harmony os distributed framework and integrates atomic services let's take a look at how me time flows between the devices [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign foreign [Music] oh atomic services are delivered through service widgets service widgets are the unified language that how many os devices use to communicate nothing needs to be installed you can use it as you need in a service center you can find all service widgets can also be pinned onto the home screen all of this is possible with one tab we hope to aggregate more atomic services in the service center service widgets can flow between different harmony os based devices whatever service widgets are the services go together i might be reading a news on my phone and then one to four the news to my friend i just share the service widget and the recipient can tap to read it they don't need to install any apps and can simply check the news by tapping on the service widget your phone can even communicate with a transit pass reader with a service widget you can enable one hub so that by tapping the phone against the machine relevant information for your trip will be displayed on the service widget what's more it can remind you to get off your bus or to get off at your stop the service center is available on smartphones watches [Music] [Music] foreign you [Music] bye these are the partners that have worked together with huawei to use the distributed framework and atomic services to create apps within a short period of time an increasing number of partners have seen the value of the technologies and we are grateful for their support performance has always been our focus by optimizing the full stack of harmony os including the kernel hardware abstraction layer runtime and framework the performance of harmony os is superior to that of the android-based emui about 20 of users hit the limit of rome after using their phone for 36 weeks 36 months and then the phone starts to get slow when they open an app or a game or or they are trying to perform other operations such as editing a file each operation generates a large amount of data all this data is written in two and read from the room when the speed of the read and write is impacted user experience suffers so how many os has implemented a number of innovations to ensure that even if rome is almost fully occupied the phone will still operate quickly and smoothly during sequential read sequential right random read and random right the new harmony os also introduces a new technology our proprietary d graphic the d graphic engine introduces several innovations first it performs intelligent computing scheduling in the system the graphic rendering doesn't rely solely on the gpu instead gpu and cpu work together on intelligent scheduling and rendering another new innovation is to decouple the rendering logic from the service processing logic one logic will no longer interfere the operation of another so the graphics look smoother and the frame rate is improved also we have adopted the render service capability it doesn't perform repetitive rendering and thus reduces the load of video processing with all these technologies consumers can now experience smoother operations smooth emotions the latest iphone can last for 3.9 hours while playing a graphic intensive game whereas a huawei smartphone can last 5.1 hours when users open multiple apps on their phone an operating system tend to freeze the apps in the background to reserve resources for the ones in the foreground so we constantly hear people talking about killing a running program if i'm shopping online and want to learn more about an item i often switch to another app later i come back to the shopping app the page i was browsing is gone this means i have to search for the item again this is not optimal experience for consumers only harmony os whenever you go back to the previous page the previous app such as a shopping app you will always return to the page you are on apps are always running since the first day huawei entered the consumer market security and privacy have been its priority we want to guarantee that consumers can access our products and services without having any concerns we always do our best to protect consumer privacy for example when a consumer is trying to unlock their phone they can enable collaborative authentication this feature will authenticate a user through their watch data and face this mechanism is more reliable than relying on just a single factor the security solution of harmony os super device authenticates a device id and the public and the private key pair only when everything is confirmed will the device become a part of one super device we also work with third-party certification organizations almost every certificate granted to our device so far has been rated at the highest level the harmonious we're launching today is the first open harmony commercial distribution open harmony is an open source project of the open atom foundation only by making the harmony os ecosystem open can he have the opportunity to succeed we welcome more partners to develop harmony to develop open harmony distributions for different domains to create offerings for different fields this is the new harmony os now i'd like to hand the floor to my colleague please stay tuned for more [Music] [Music] oh a [Applause] so [Music] two two two oh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] thank you os adopts a new architecture to address the demands of different hardware hardware features different ram and different processing capabilities and some require more power these different requirements can be addressed with one operating system harmony os the most revolutionary feature of harmony os is its distributed technology which break down the boundaries of physical hardware allowing devices to seamlessly collaborate this capability redefines consumer experience the atomic services of harmony os are free from installation enabling services to simply flow between devices the service widgets serve as a unified language for connected things I gotta say and it's not every day I'm I gotta say and it's not every day I'm this excited will has been promoting this excited will has been promoting this package around the studio I got this package around the studio I got something coming in I got the
