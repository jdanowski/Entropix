oh my god i miss ireland hey gabriel hi guys so thank you for joining today's live um so i hope the internet is gonna be okay uh what's going on so last time this happened again and i'm like so heartbroken why this kind of um anyway uh are you guys like hi from louisiana and germany it's uh can you guys see me okay all right all right this seems not okay now i can see at least the letters so i have been traveling quite some time and i just got back from new york hi jen you're so oh you finally finished my book thank you so much for reading it um it's amazing the book came out almost five years ago now and still it's been continued to be read by a lot of people and because of you guys doing that so i'm very grateful thank you thank you benjamin thank you so much for your interview the other day please ask your viewers to check it out thank you ben of course i will yeah ben and i had this awesome interview and i will share the link with you guys after this so oh my gosh lily thank you for reading the book today i turned on this live first of all one was just really checking you guys how you all have been doing and also reporting you on very exciting news that has been happening in north korea for the last couple of weeks it's been quite sad right did you guys see that news where i think fox reported that kim jong-un was banning skinny jeans and the mullet bullet the hairstyle and sentencing people to the concentration camp for wearing skinny jeans and now with the vitamin administration the north korean news barely make it to anything and now this really there's no coverage whatsoever and this is such a sad time even though things are getting a lot harder for the people during the north korea to not get any coverage so that's why today i turned on camera to make sure that updating you guys what's happening to the country and also you know see what you guys been curious about and have any questions for me and so that's going to be our agenda today first news is um the about the news that i really want to share with you today is oh i just got so the other day we heard the south korean news reported that there were a lot of leaflets were spread in in the middle of pyongyang in the capital and the leaflets were literally saying that death kim jong-un the kim yo-jong kim jong sister is evil and kim jong is ruining the country and that we are not slaves and these leaflets were spread in a massive amount inside the pyongyang this is like the first time ever something like this happened i mean we were trying to reach leaflets inside the pyongyang but it never go that far and in this never scale and this shows how much north korea is changing under kim jong-un the people are actually realizing every single day that they are not slaves to the regime and they are not less afraid i think becoming less and less afraid risking their lives to reward i wish that this news was made to western media but of course it was only covered in the south korean media and i really thought we might actually see liberty in north korea in our lifetime we're just trying to continue i think this is my possible and so that was like quick updates on what's going on and now i'm here to answer any question you might have so any question you have ask me please so how do you know these info so mario's asked i think it's a really good question so i wanted to say that so since i've been doing this youtube channel and do you guys know that i also have a south korean channel with my north korean colleague so that channel is being viewed by a lot of elites from north korea who are working abroad in china russia and the other other like the southern southeast asia and middle east even and they actually have been reaching out to us that they want to escape and in the middle of pandemic we don't know how to rescue those people so we do have sources the elites north korea working abroad like china russia mainly those are the main source of information and the second is of course the our relatives and the family members in the border towns so we have brokers inside north korea but normally they are enrolled in the border town so they can use a chinese cell phone with chinese signal because north korea do not have internet and their phones cannot make international phone calls you cannot like call somebody in north korea right now so we smuggle phones through china border to north korea within the northern border border town then we call chinese number and that's how i speak to north korean brokers inside north korea and sometimes they called it using the north korean phone to call somebody in a north korea with a speaker phone so it's like an entire operation that we do to reach out to people inside north korea right now and the information comes out i know most of north korean the elite defectors in south korea and they have really tough information and also the people that i know the ones are always in the like the border towns so in various channels and also most of the news that south korea japan reports do not make it to mainstream american news so that's like this time those leaflets came out south korean media and that's how i know and it is amazing like how much does not how much do not get covered in american media right now when it comes north korea list i mean during the cycle video guys i've been just sitting at home working and you don't talk to actually a live person i've been talking to worse so it's a miracle that i have someone to talk to right now you like rescued me from my like lonely home my voice is finally coming back since i've been not spoken any word out light at home by myself so laura asked is your family in north korea still good oh i spoke about this in the past no they are not because i spoke out against the regime after my escape the regime you know did something called the guilt by association they punished three generations of my family who relate to me and i don't know if they've been executed or sent to concentration camp but whatever it was even going to concentration camp means death anyway so they all have been punished um [Music] so let's see what other questions if you guys have uh uh if you could travel anywhere right now where would you go i want to go to europe i love european countries it has a very rich history so i definitely want to go to europe right now so a lot of people have been asking me uh so what about what are questions thank you for your kind words if you get um actions will do need to be taken for north korean people to be freed i think it's very simple guys speak out against chinese communist party that's all you need to do north korea and this this human rights crisis is solely responsible because chinese communist party has been sponsoring kim jong-un all these years even people keep saying like oh the regime the kim zone is a problem like yeah kim jong is only there because he zimping supports him without chinese communist party support north korean regime cannot even last one day that's how simple it is but right now in the western democracy countries even the big corporations like nike adidas do not speak against this injustice by chinese communist party and i think the most important thing that what we do right now is raising this awareness about how china is responsible for the suffering of north korean people i mean yeah kim jong is of course irresponsible but then who is enabling him that is china and the lack of knowledge of in the in the world right now how much damage that china is causing is shocking in this information age that we have access to all this kind of information it all gets like um censored by mainstream media and all these corporations and stars like lebron james being bought by china and the people who fight for justice in america do not fight for do not want to fight for other people in other country the hypocrisy inconsistency and corruption is blocking people know about who is actually responsible for north korean people's you know suffering and i think that's the main thing that you guys can help me to do is like sharing my videos and sharing other north korean people's videos to let the educating the public and eventually that people gonna demand our politicians in america european countries other countries to act against nurse i mean chinese government and i think that can bring freedom to my people and so many other people are suffering right now because chinese communist party right now uh so linda thank you for your uh generous donation how can we best help as i said you know first guys help me spread this word by sharing videos and telling your friends about the harm that china are causing in this world second is get involved with the non-profits i made this video in the past about the title is that how to help north koreans literally and in that video detail section there are non-profits that i recommend that you can get involved some of these non-profits actually rescue norsken defectors right now from china the girls who are like me being sold as a sex slaves to chinese men we can rescue these girls to freedom if you have two thousand dollars you can rescue one girl from china to freedom to america south korea will wherever you want and if you don't have money then you still can't volunteer to these non-profits that who are helping nursing defectors with teaching them english and also you know teach them mentorship them and giving them advice and other organization that i support is getting information the outside information inside north korea so there are various non-profits that you can contribute to it doesn't have to be only money it can be your talent and time so i think those kind of action can be very helpful to have nursing people right now so oh my god thank you so much is softer you gotta teach me how to pronounce your name someday why interest does china have in supporting kim that's a great question why does china supporting kim jong-un right all this time china has been the biggest ally of north korea so when the after world war ii ended there is a two countries like south korea and north korea south korea was supported by the u.s north korea supported by the soviet union and china and actually funny enough mazo dong the mao's son died in korean war by defending north korea from the western democratic countries so that's how much china would invest in north korea there's a saying that china always say the relationship between north korea and china is like between the your lips and your teeth so without your lips you cannot really eat or talk but your teeth without your teeth you also cannot eat or talk so you they're in interdependent they need each other to survive in this world i think it's called dependence coming from because south korea and japan and america is like the democratic country so if north korea falls that democracy that movement is an encounter right next to their door and internally china is struggling right there's tibet xinjiang so many regions want to be independent and in this internal struggle if china lets north korea become south korea prosperius people have rights to freedom of speech all of that chinese people will automatically want it so north korea is in a way a buffer zone to protect uh chinese people not exposed to freedom and the western democratic like the values that is also main reason but another reason also recent years that china has been using north korea as a leverage against the usa so if china north korea does a lot of nuclear tests missiles blah blah causing a lot of instability then of course the first thing america gonna do is going to talk china about it and then begging china to stop north korea so now china can say okay america listen to me you do this for me if you do that for me i can talk to kim jong-un and ask him to stop this missile test so various reasons north korea became very useful tool for china to use right now and because of this politics because of the guys like xi jinping the communist party and kim jong-un who are who wants to be god in this 21st century that people are suffering because of this corrupt politics that people are suffering right now uh so john thank you so much yemi i am so sorry for your family you are beautiful and i love your channel thank you i'm glad that you are speaking out against north korea thank you so much um i know like i it's it's gonna be my forever dilemma for me to always figure like was it worth it to risk that many lives to speak out against the vision i will never know like i will never know that but every day you know after go through what i went through because i have seen so much darkness you know it's i cannot be just now happy like oh i can eat hamburger i can eat pizza i can be now my struggle is over right that's not how simple human beings are and in a way i'm desperate to find the meaning in my life every single day so i can get up in the morning and get out of my bed and and live life with a meaning and that helps me so i don't know why i survived but i i hope there's a meaning why i survived and when i was literally speaking out i did not know that i was risking my family's lives i i knew that i was risking my own life and i was okay with that but then i just did not know the regime was gonna go after our family like i was literally 13 when i escaped it's not like i was exposing the nuclear tests and those like top military secrets to the world i was literally saying the things that what every north korean spoke about and what the un spoke about like starvation systemic oppression public execution all these general things that everybody knew i spoke about and regime would go after me that viciously i didn't expect and of course i'm still like endangering my life every single day but i really try my best to make my the price that my relatives to pay for me to having that voice and make that worth it so you guys helping me to do that and i am like internal like eternally grateful for that so let's see um thank you guys diana uh let's see uh elizabeth you should do a collaboration with adv chyna shout out to libby okay i don't know what that is but i'm gonna look it up adv china i'm gonna take a photo of it so i can follow up um it is even in the youtube space i've been connecting to a lot of other youtubers and it has been unbelievable how much china has been paying even the youtubers to defend china and not speak ill of chinese government so it's so sad like how many corporations celebrate even hollywood every this big corporation mainstream sectors bought by china even the ivy league schools like the academia like media every single fact i mean branch now be bought by china it is unbelievable how how this like democracy is losing against this evil and i think it is our job as individual to guard our freedom and our rights and stand up against this injustice yeah can china can make people disappear anywhere this is how they die yeah yuri they they are so powerful that i really worry that at some point we may lose the power to stop this huge evil and then we i don't know what the world is going to be like if we lose in this battle between justice and between china and what's gonna happen to entire humanity are we gonna be forever enslaved and that is totally possible um so let's see the other questions uh greetings are from ireland i love ireland so are you familiar with the starlink and how it can be used to help the north koreans it sounds very familiar i would love to know about that so do elites really know what is going on jerry is i asked yes the elites know what is really going on um that i wasn't sure but only recently i came to this realization because guys i've been receiving so many uh requests from north korean elites who are working abroad so this is another shocking thing is so i told about those like hackers like kim jong-un like trains and tried to this character assassinate people like me and other people and when kim jong-un like dispatched these workers abroad working for the regime like working in europe china russia the regime do not even pay this worker workers who are working tirelessly for the regime and they're using this ideology called the self-reliance so asking these workers to figure out what they're gonna eat and their rent while they are like working as a hacker for kim jong-un in china so i mean these technologies and these other workers been reaching out to me that their life is so horrible even as an elite in abroad and they want to escape so i was really confused like how kim jong-un beat this dumb like he doesn't even provide the basic necessity for the elite to survive when they work abroad like you know for the regime and i think this shows that how that's breaking zone also is and there's how unstable now the royalty from the elites for the regime and i truly believe that if the international community continue to speak out for the people of north korean people and their human rights and if we continue to our increased pressure on china to stop sponsor kim jong-un we might be able to see change in that country within like even five years time and also especially seeing that how many elites from north korea want to escape this is like shocking because elites were happy under kim jong-il the second kim and kim kimir song and this is the first time the elites became super unhappy with the regime and i think kim jong is definitely playing with the fire right now that he's not you know he doesn't care about anybody other than himself and you don't have any alliance with anybody you cannot run the entire dictatorship with the 25 million people so yeah kim jong-un is i don't know is being reckless or being ignorant ignorant i really don't know but he's definitely playing something very dangerous right now so well since i said you didn't collab with them adv china is run by matt and win winston okay you're on aldo low low lowy 86 is the right mat okay yeah that was amazing thank you so sub sub tarshi right sabotage me your pakistan low 8060 was amazing okay that was the mumbai yeah i would love to do something with them again but he and i have the same problem like all our videos get continued to be demonetized by youtube and i have a patreon i was sharing that with my patreon account that they say like believe her right whenever women accuse men of raping them or sexually assault them their mantra now mainstreams i believe her no matter the evidence so i was making videos about how north korean women being raped in china by chinese men how north korea remain raped by this communist party in north korea by this like military men and they were demonetizing all these videos and saying this does not meet the youtube guideline so what happened to me too and what happened to believe her so it only applies when women raped in western democracy countries i guess when women raped by capitalists i guess they're gonna believe it by when women raped by calmness they don't want to believe it they don't even talk about it so this is a hypocrisy sickening and it is like we definitely the more content creators like matt and other people who can just continuously shows the hypocrisy and the the world that we are living in right now how injustice how how corrupt this is right now like if i really didn't start youtube channel i would not know how corrupt the media would be and and take like take this giants how much power they would have and how much power they have even shaping my thoughts and mind my world view and it is unbelievable like how many people do not understand that we are being shaped by these tech monopolies every single day they're shaping how we think what to believe and in a way it's like it's another brainwashing in some ways even more powerful because in north korea when i was brainwashed like there was no other information right so it was in a way like i was okay maybe when you where when you're in this like block of information no other information no internet it makes sense people get brainwashed but now being in this information age people still get brainwashed and people still develop this like tonal vision and of course like tag is the main tool for that so this is so scary right now that like how we can be shaped by certain things so easily and and people were like laughing at me like is north korean people are dumb why are they brainwashed they why do they know that kim's are dictators and like i was like asking what about you guys you are living in this country and still so brainwashed and it really makes me question like human nature you know it is fascinating to see what humans are capable hi vincent thank you thank you for your continuing to be a shining star for nursing people your words are making a difference thank you vincent and vincent is my patreon thank you for my patrons and they are also doing the uh moderation today in this chat so thank you guys for your support as always uh so let's see uh thank you mary uh so so can people vote against the workers party t-s-t-u-s-w asked so in north korea we do have election do you know that north korea is a dprk the democratic people's republic of korea so it's a it's democracy according to them we have a we have election and it's not like your choice if not voting is not an option you're going to go to jail for it when you go to ballot box there is a person standing there watching you and there's only one candidate already designated by the party and it's public for everyone can see who you vote so that's the voting night in north korea literally there's a gun point right next to you if you don't vote you're gonna get killed and also you don't even have any option anyway you get the one ballot is already designated by the party you put in the right box and what people are watching you and the guards watching you so there's no way you can vote against the party communist party that is impossible that is not even an option so in north korea do people do not even know how the voting works in a democratic countries i haven't voted because i'm not a citizen i i don't know how easy can i even feel like having that many candidates and having the freedom to choose whoever you want and so it is so funny how these dictatorship countries are so shameless calling themselves a democrat democracy so what question should i go for um [Music] so how do you feel that south korean prison meet biden and you asked i don't know how many guys are following the south korean news south korean president is abandoning almost the alliance between the us for china so south korea became a puppet state of china already it does whatever season being asked of him and of course mundane is also the south korean president is sympathizing with kim jong-un and it has been such a fascinating and scary thing to see how how fast the democracy falls that prosperous prosperous country south korea that we all you know like shocked and in a surprised way that country is now falling and just became a puppet state of china i mean china owns south korea now china owns so many parts of africa i mean south it means like america so many countries by owned by china so it's not a surprise but it was really sad to see that how america was losing their ally that quickly and now you know we cannot even trust south korea anymore as an ally in this at this point so let's see some other question so how much does north korea resemble the november 1984 yeah i used to write compared north korea to 1984 in the past and it in some ways it became a lot like 1984 and so made a lot not like 1984. so though i'm going to talk about the ways that it became a lot like 1984. the technology that has been developing like the facial recognition those like camera system has made the north korea look way more like 1984. so north korea cannot even afford the electricity in this 21st century has been importing this technology from china this facial recognition cameras especially so they put them on the border towns and the borders and around the towns so regime can see who is the outsider is coming to that town so in north korea guys you're not only like controlled like not leaving the country but you are controlled within a country so for instance like now you know in chicago right now i can say like okay i'm gonna have a sleepover at someone hotel i can do that right now right but north koreans you that you do not even have a freedom to have a sleepover within your own time this is how control freak the regime is so everybody have to sleep in a designated home that night that regime designate you you cannot just go to a material hotel say i'm gonna sleep over tonight and pay them you have to get a permission from authority to have a slip over so they make sure that no outsider from other town going into this town and making the print the cameras the regime can know that this person is not registered in this region so that is definitely way more like 1984 and everybody is watching right the big brother is watching you all the time and the parts that became less like 1984 is in in the 1984 like a lot of people do not question they do believe that that they are in war with other countries and they are living in the best country it used to be like that even when i was there it was like that i was completely believing that there was nothing can be that i was you know i had the best leader in this world i was so thankful to having kim's as my leader but now a lot of north koreans actually know because of the awesome information that they are not living in the socialist paradise but the only people god is a fear that fear of death fear of their desires of their family because of that people are obeying not because they are actually grateful to be in that country so some parts are changing but the fear part has been increasing especially kim jong-un that he's a merciless guy that he when he executes people in youth videos like normal guns shooting people now kim jong-un using the artillery artillery to kill people the the guns that you shoot down the airplanes so imagine you shoot people with that artillery do you know what happens the human bodies become the flashes become into pieces that you don't even recognize their faces anymore like they become almost like just dust and this fear causing people to want to be open or like obedient no matter what this like forever traumatize your brain and that's what kim jong has been using so it's been horrifying like how a human can be this evil like when kim jong-il right the second kim i was thinking how can anybody worse than that and every kim comes in like it proves to be wrong like every king comes in like oh my god yeah you can go you can be definitely worse than that and the i think like seeing like people after going through holocaust right that the victor who was a book wrote that like men searching for meaning right you keep questioning what it means to be a human and i think dr jordan peterson also talks about in his book 12 tribals for life like that the human nature and humans are so capable like evil that we can't even imagine but also we can so capable of being good and i think north korean regime is demonstration that like when we do not stop evil it does not know when to stop and that's why we have to fight against otherwise they are never gonna stop on their own so okay um let's see i mean thank you guys for joining today i mean today is a thursday night and hearing about what is happening to north korea i i don't know like how do i get the the present biden to care about norse human rights issue he seems like he really wants to care about human rights in america but somehow he doesn't want to care about for other people and this is still like challenging for me to understand like if you care about human rights for certain group how do you not care about other people right and so that's what i've been always doing i try to be fair like like all lives matter literally it doesn't you don't nobody choose your color of your skin nobody choose your birthplace and the fact that people punish for their color over skin for their birth this is an injustice that we need to end and right now in america it is so sad how people are obsessed with certain groups rights and do not want to apply the same care same attention for all other people's rights and that is also injustice that we must end so let's see so let's see what question should i be answering yeah me do you like kimchi that's a fun question i do like kimchi i'm korean guys uh when i was north korea that's all i ate too so uh i i cannot live without kimchi my mom cannot live without kimchi i have to eat kimchi i used to eat kimchi every single meal like any korean would do nowadays i became like less of it but i still love kimchi uh so do you i love how people ask me these like food questions uh let's see [Music] so are you hoping for a military intervention um so that is a long so off-the-cuff adventure thank you so much for your generous donation and i see chris i enjoy watching your videos just wanted to thank you for all you do i appreciate you keep it going thank you very much uh and time is all right i missed you there then for you thank you very much for that so be careful your amazing woman thank you then so do i still put into like a military intervention i don't know how many guys have seen my guest interviews with the other north skin defectors so it was fascinating to other noise talking to other north koreans because when you're in north korea you can never talk about politics right we can never ask you what do you think about this so only it was even metering asking another north koreans about what they thought about politics and the what feature of north korea was such a learning experience when i spoke to like nina sherry i mean like luna a lot like north koreans on the channel they all said their parents told them the only way to end kim jong-un's regime kim's regime was for someone to invade and physically remove the dictatorship because because of china is back in the regime north korean people will never ever have enough power to spite against china so the fact that even the revolution is gonna be if there's a coup happens right the people like every single north korean decides okay we're gonna fight for our freedom but then like we saw what happens with the hong kong this time guys 75 of hong kongers went outside on their street and they demanded justice and freedom and individual liberty what did china do it wasn't democracy even though more than half like 75 of hong kongers wanted to be free outside of china china did not give it to them so hong kong last because there was a big big this gigantic communist party chinese comes by it was behind it we could not like win so even though majority of north korea gonna go on the street and marching and demand the freedom as long as china supports in the behind they can never win the china will always place a puppet regime for them so they can control the north korean government north korean people only way in a way sadly the way like change can come from is where a government is bigger or as big as china come after them which is at this current modern world all we got is the u.s u.s is the last hope that to stop china because no other country is big enough to do that at this point so i think that is unfortunately why it's not like i'm a warmonger like i want to see blood on the street i want to see world like only way that practical and realistic right now is something that bigger than china or as big as china come and remove it and that is the usa so it is the reality is a lot a lot complicated like people say i hate more like who doesn't want like who doesn't like who wants war right nobody wants conflict nobody wants like this sacrifice and nobody wants blood and that we all know that but then price is like the continuation of 25 millions of people slavery and of course if there's a war happens we are gonna lose a lot of millions of people in south korea and that's why also i don't support that but the thing is simply you say the military option is out of the table that is not okay like we need to consider every option it is the same thing going back to world war ii like of course like it was heartbreaking those people in japan died from the nuclear bomb the u.s dropped but think about how many people that bomb saved like at least that bomb liberated my people without that bomb dropping in japan japan would not let us to be independent they would continue to colonize us raping our women do you guys know the comfort women right the japanese colonists when they came they were raping our women making our sexual slaves from korea philippines thai thailand china so things we are never black and white like that so the fact that i say we need to explore the option of military intervention they're like you say you're crazy you're a cruel person and no like the fact that how many people were saved by that bomb that america dropped i am grateful for that america took that step to freeing so many people and sometimes we might come to that with north korea we might lose maybe two to two three million in south korea in the border but we might save 25 million people and the question is what i uh what are you gonna choose and in the perfect world we never have to deal with these monstrous dictators right that's a perfect word but word is not perfect and i think that's why i really hope that whatever the politician is gonna be they they consider that option and choose the one that saves the most people unfortunately there's always trade-offs and i think i think it's so sad that is how the world is like but you know we need to consider that option before we see further north korea developing bombs that is my attacking in the usa and we have to live with disgrace two dictators in china and north korea have the massive weapons of destruction and can kill all of us on this earth that would be not that one would not be good anymore for anybody in this world so is it hard to say when did you discover your love for fashion did you know you loved clothes when you was in north korea and that's very cute question so in north korea i never even seen um fashion magazine guys there is no more there like there's no victoria's secret there's no laundry or no fashion nothing the our clothes i mean i just talked about how north korea banned the skinny jeans and the hairstyle mullet hairstyle so like that even what you wear is controlled by the regime they tell you what to wear i mean what to listen to what to watch so the word fashion didn't exist and coming to america seeing the fashion magazine i was so confused and hearing about these motors and i i fell in love with the fashion but not in north korea and there are so many jobs that are unknown to north korean people i was like one day people are saying like oh you should write a second book but i thought maybe i should book for my people explaining what fashion magazine is explaining what playboy magazine is you know what explain what ship club is like explaining what you know the food blog is explaining what cook magazine is seriously like like explain what bath is explain what shower is explain what like internet is can you like what manicure is what like literally every single thing that we have north koreans do not have because their life standout is like living in the 16th century like literally 16th century we go to river and take bath in the river i didn't even know what like conditional was and like what shampoo is what is body wash is what detergent is right so like what i have to like right from my people is maybe unimaginable list of things that i need to explain to them what those are and when north korea comes down like i need to like open another youtube channel for my people explain like each items to them and for of course the things that we know like any human being know but of course nursing people don't know that's how different planet north korea is guys like no country is like this and it's a shame on us that if we like how do we move forward as a humanity living 25 million human beings are left in that mid age time you know that's like i remember i was like showing to some of my doctor friends when i was having these sore throats we don't have like medical devices right we don't have this modern medicine so uh this like strong person in our neighborhood told me that put something on my like uh here here and burning my skin so he said it's gonna help me with my sore throat it didn't help obviously so he said let's burn this and it doesn't happen let's burn here so so many people like nursery got burnt skins because of this backwards backwards backwards medicine and it shows that like how much we have in this world that we cannot share with other people and i think this is why i'm fighting for these people i think it's a shame that if we don't share this prosperity with other humans when we can because we got so much here simply uh so okay i think i'm gonna answer two more questions guys i'm so grateful that you stayed here with me and continuously supporting me and spreading my messaging and i'm so grateful for my patreons again guys thank you for having my back and thank you guys for watching my videos so let's see what the last two questions gonna be so bubble bubble gum is that right i mean you have to become an anarchist and nuke and kim the u.s only cares for oil hong kong and north korea just puppet to the u.s against china yeah i've been actually i just started reading this book called the anarchist handbook and why i think i need to have a lot of thought transformation to get there i am libertarian guys i but the thing is i still support borders i share support military defense i still support very very limited government i do always know the harm of government the dangers comes with it that any absolute power gonna corrupt that's the nature of power so whenever we give a power to somebody that's a such a dangerous thing that we need to really have all the second thoughts and the ideology of the anarchist has been really challenging my thinking process how i thought of as an intellectual but i am not there yet and this is like where i am i think the beer is beautiful thing about living in freedom is that you have freedom to change your mind and this is when i get so angry when in the mainstream media you cannot change your mind you cannot grow as a thinker like you have to believe the one thing and never change your thoughts on it you cannot evolve as a human being you gotta be a perfection that they met they demand you to be right now at this point and that is such a bizarre and unbelievable thing to demand of a human being because we are constantly changing and we need to strive to evolve and become better so i have never have a reservation to become a expanding my thoughts and understand different concepts so thank you so much hannah and our mana supporting you good work thank you so much guys for your kind words so last question what shall we do i love this q a so much i should do more um let's see what other things should we be looking at uh so aren't you not worried about your safety i do and i keep saying that even this time like did you guys see that how belarus the dictator luka sanko was kidnapping a journalist like that hijacking the airplane the word that we need to fight for is that there should be more accountability when dictators harming distance like that it's not because i'm a distant it's because i get so many messages from people saying like oh i want to become a human rights activist i want to become an activist i want to become a human rights lawyer and i i i want all of them to be safe like when kim jong-un was killing his hotbar in malaysia with the poison there was no accountability for killing a human being for kim jong-un when saudi arabia killing the jamar khashoggi the saudi jones in the turkish embassy chopping off him like a lamb chop literally in this 21st century while people like fighting for animals rights they were he was doing that to kill a human being in this 21st century no accountability whatsoever so of course when kim jong-un care whatever the way he wants there's no accountability but that's not the thing even if i'm gone guys even if i get killed tomorrow like one thing that i want everyone to know is that that is a word that we need to fight for because like human rights matters that human lives matters like every human life matters and this is a god-given right and nobody can take that away from us and because because we want our rights to be respected that we need to fight for others rights i think it's all in always a selfish thing to do like if you don't defend human rights nobody gonna defend your own rights as a human being and this is why human rights is so not such a cliche thing this the battle the world our journey for achieving human rights hasn't ended it just only begun and this is how human rights violated every single day by the dictators guys and this is our responsibility to educate ourselves letting people know and defend this precious rights that we have so with that note i want to thank you all your time today and all your those wonderful questions i know the donations i'm so sorry that i miss a lot of questions but i will try my best to do more this kind of live session so i can answer your questions let me know also if there are any videos that you want to watch the topics that you're curious about i truly believe that guys we can do this together that if we have enough people joining this channel and wants to see freedom in north korea and demand accountability from chinese communist party and demanding our present to act and talk to china about this issue i think we can do that using using our voice so i'm grateful to be in this journey and in this movement video and i look forward to seeing you guys all next time thank you my patrons for modeling this chat i look forward to seeing you all next time i love you guys so much love you guys see you soon guys bye
