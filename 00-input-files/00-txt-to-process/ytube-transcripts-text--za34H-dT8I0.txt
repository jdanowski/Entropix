when i was a child very first thing that my mom told me was not to even whisper because the birds and mice could hear me if somebody say one wrong thing it kills entire three generations of that family there was no internet one channel on tv what were the subjects you guys took in school even like learning math was like there are four american masters you killed two of them then how many american pastors left to care we don't play with the barbie doors we play with tanks even kids have to go see the public execution my mind my imagination i just went there so for me it's tough to kind of come back but painful stuff you talk about that doesn't sound real to the average person if you see the satellite photo north korea is literally the darkest place on earth and in the posters how american looked like was green eyes and humongous nose so in america the government makes money through taxes how does north korea make money north korea is not a poor country they sell drugs they sell missiles they steal a lot of money through hacking they serve their people china has a responsibility to protect us but they capture us negotiating our price like dogs there is no dignity there is no freedom for us in china the only way to get anything done with north korea is to get things done with china this regime kept this going for over 70 years there do you know how many north korean defectors right now in america over 70 years of time 200. my guest today has i would say the most interesting story we've ever had on valuetainment you'll find out here in a minute why her name is yanomi park she wrote a book called in order to live she escaped north korea at 13 years old found her way to china uh eventually south korea eventually dublin u.s all over the place and she's now resides in u.s she gave a talk back in 2014 at the one young world in dublin which within two days her eight minute talk got 50 million views let me say this one more time 50 million views in two days and from there she's been a phenomenon because she's given us the world a glimpse of what it really is like to live in north korea not from what msnbc tells us not from what cnn tells us not from what fox tells us her point of view of what it was like living there for uh 13 years and so with that being said janome park thank you so much for being a guest on valuetainment thank you so much for having me it's a real honor to be on your show it's great to have you so you know me let's go back for for those of us who have never visited north korea all we've seen is the videos all we've seen is you know we've read about it we've seen articles about it we've seen different things about it what was it like for you growing up in north korea yeah so i think that was the almost like the biggest challenge for me to talk about my experience in north korea is that sometimes i feel like if it's even easier to explain about mars or the moon to americans then north korea like north korea is a country that has so many pieces right the life that kim jong-un the dictator has is absolutely different from the people's lives that i had and my friends had so i think today i i am going to talk about the people who are in the not in that privileged in a one percent class but the majority of north koreans how they are actually surviving every day i think it's just almost like a unimaginable everyday life is a struggle you know in north korea yeah when i was growing up there were even no words for depression so or even stress so as i growing up as a child when i came to south korea they told me like stress is like very big you know cause for something depression is like big main cause for suicide and i was like what is that and you don't know what stress is like what you don't know what depression is and in north korea the regime didn't put that words in the dictionary for us so you know imagine that in socialist paradise how can you possibly stress how can you be possibly depressed but in our real life is a struggle but we just don't know how to put those like concept into words i think you know when i was a child first very first thing that my parents my mom told me was not to even whisper because the ma the birth and mice could hear me and as a young girl the first thing i learned is that the most dangerous thing in my body that i got is my tongue what if i slip some wrong words that is not gonna only kill me that is not gonna only kill my family it is going to kill three generations of of my family if somebody say one wrong thing political statement is not gonna just kill that person it kills entire three generations of that family and that is like so in that sense i never knew what you know freedom of speech i somehow thought that's how a normal world was because there was no internet obviously i never heard the word internet in north korea there is only one channel on tv 24 hours that is telling us how wonderful the socialist paradise is and how bad our american ambassadors enemies are and you know i remember when i came to america going to walmarts and going to see this like section of magazines right they have living like magazine fashion magazine cook magazine i never seen any kind of magazine north korea like in every single cookbook there's like i never heard of what modeling was like there's no fashion magazine the regime the government telling us what to wear what kind of haircut you can have what kind of makeup you can have what kind of pants you can wear what kind of song you can sing what kind of movie you can watch what kind of dance you can dance every little thing is determined by the regime even before i was born and even where i live who i can marry what can i do in life is determined by my political class in the in the country so telling americans that although people who free people like they think you know like you choose what major you study what clothes you wear everything for them is so natural but coming from north korea even picking up a pants was a struggle for me like how i choose among like 10 different pants they are selling how do i choose like what i like because in north korea nobody asks me like what do i think that's that's that's wild when you think about it by the way to have that kind of an experience and did you did you experience any i know you said the most powerful weapon you have is your tongue because if you say something it could hurt three generations not just yourself your parents your grandparents etc etc but you know there has to be an element of somebody being rebellious and if there was somebody that was rebellious if you do remember what typically happened to somebody that was rebellious against a regime like that so like in school right at school i didn't go to school i didn't learn about the revolution or democracy or none of that things that i learned is like how brave like what kind of miracles our dear leader can do and how bad the west the democracy the the world was and you know everything was brainwashing in school like even like learning math was like there are four american ambassadors you killed two of them then how many american pastors left to care as like five sixty years old you say two american bastards and the game that you play we don't play with the barbie doors we don't play some legos we play with tanks you either use mud and build tanks and say the teacher is like why did you build this tank because like i built this thing because i want to kill our enemies and be loyal to our dear leader and like we build this snowman in school and we bring like hot boiling water and pour on top of the snowmen and that snowman we makes like american monster and we say hey american enemies are gone so that's the education so there was really no concept of being a distant or being a re rebellious but i'm sure there was that's why you see constantly see these public executions and see this political prison camp people in our neighborhoods disappear all the time and we always have to go to see public you know trial and public execution in north korea there's no such a thing called like concept of minor even you're like five seven years old if the school teachers say you have to go see public execution when someone gets shot in front of your high eyes even kids have to go see the public execution and so in that situation i think i think in some our ways we work rebellious like uh watching photon dvds and that kills us but people still risking their lives imagine like right now we are risking our life or watching or some kind of movie and in north korea people actually literally risking their lives to watch a movie from the free world what what were what were some of the by the way in my mind my imagination i just went there so for me it's tough to kind of come back but what were the topics and the subjects you had in school so did you have world history did you have what what were the topics what were the subjects you guys took in school so again like uh i mean kim jong-un he went to school in switzerland so this mostly kids do go to school in switzerland in moscow in like in china in europe everywhere in germany but the most of the bottom class like which is like 90 80 percent of population aren't that lucky so i'm not talking about the majority of people in school i didn't learn about the like big bang of revolution i mean the evolution of human history i never even seen the map of the world so i never knew like how the world looked like i never knew how many planets like of course i had no idea mars or like all these like different planets and i never even knew actually you exist as a iranian i never knew like therefore they were like different ways they existed they told us about americans but they only i mean we don't have internet and we cannot like get other books so all we can rely on is like the like uh posters that was provided by the regime and in the posters how american looked like was with the green eyes and humongous nose and they said they are like cold blooded creatures so i never knew actually though americans were like warm bloody humans they said they were like monsters and so i did not know like they were like african-americans they are like middle easterners all these different ways so in school it was really like they taught us about american monsters japanese imperialists and maybe china but not so much and all about the you know we have to memorize the birthday of their leaders what year they did what what year did what literally our school curriculum is dedicated to learn about like the greatness of the dear leaders and what it's like uh they literally copy the bible if you think about it so they put kimier song as the god who loved us who was chosen by this universe and loves us so much he gave us his son kim jong-ir which is jesus and their body dies like jesus but their spirit is with us forever and when we die we become with them and we go like eternal paradise with them so that's why they can like a brainwashes to think even in my thoughts they can read my thoughts like god you know it was like literally they just like copy the bible put their names and make us like like read and learn bible in school and become just like complete like a brainwashed so did you say do you remember the enemy number one was u.s number two was japan did you say three is somewhat china or it was they are going to go back and forth they said sometimes china helped us but sometimes like china has no principle they like you know gave up and gave up the communists like all that wonderfulness and like gave into you know the corrupt capitalism but they were like going back and forth on china but they were consistently consistently hating america in japan from the very beginning i remember who who made the most money in north korea meaning um was it business owners was it doctors you know who was it that made the most money so doctor the medical doctor salary is one dollar and you cannot buy even few kilograms of rice with that so so in north korea you have to be corrupt the government's jobs is not gonna the salary you get from your job is never gonna feed you even like two days yourself so only way to people to survive is is corrupt and that is why all these government officials are taking advantage and abusing people to even for them to be greedy and for us to be you know surviving in any way possible so people in the bottom you know i grew up eating you know grasshoppers that was only my source of protein i could get and i was eating plants i was literally finding everything i could to find food in nature i didn't grow up with like a refrigerator i didn't grow up like washing machine i went to like uh you know river in the summer to take a bath in the river and wash my clothes there and you know in the winter time we don't take a bath maybe we take once before the new years and like our life is like um i don't know how people live in 15 16th century actually i read in textbooks but probably close to that ancient time like it's uh like i think the word clock going forward but when you look at the north korean people's clock is like going backwards you know if you see the satellite photo north korea is literally the darkest place on earth like you don't see any electricity in north korea other than pyongyang like you should like google like photo and see what it looks like in north korea like it is the darkest place and so people's lives are very very just like there's no way like you know people like i escaped for hunger i risked my life for the border rights i didn't escape to be free i didn't even know what freedom was like in north korea as i said like there is no concept of human rights so when i heard like animals rights i couldn't like believe like how come animals have rights why in north korea people don't even know they have rights as humans and you know they don't teach us about freedom or individual rights or none of that so when i was escaping i was just literally wondering if i go to china which is at night time when i was in north korea we don't have electricity but china had electricity so far away i could see electricity coming from china i thought maybe if i go where the lights were i might find something to eat and that's why i escaped and i came here all the way here but that is how most people are living in north korea right now i i i think you said somewhere where once you had the uh kim yong-goon that saw uh 80 people who were either watching a movie or they were reading the bible what what happened with that story and did you witness it yourself it was after i escaped in once and i think area there was almost like 100 people she just executed them all in the i think in the big stadium we import everybody in that town and they were their crimes were like watching phone dvds reading bible and and i think that was it really just like watching photo movies and just reading bibles somehow secretly they did and that is the crime people being executed in north korea right now what did you look forward to as a kid what was exciting for you like what was fun oh i can't wait to go do this with my sister my dad my mom what was it that you look forward to i mean there is like you know like when you're born in north korea like life is a struggle so you don't really expect life to be a happy thing or something to be nice i think my dream as a child was uh eating a bucket of bread so i never like really ate until i felt like full so i never knew like how much i actually could eat and then be satisfied with it so i actually thought when i was a child like i could eat the like you know mountain of like bread maybe i will never get full because i was always hungry and i always like betting these games with my sister like i can like eat ten thousand bread and my sister i can eat one million bread like i can eat more than you you know so my dream was like having a one bucket of bread and that was um an unimaginable thing to do in north korea we are so poor we can never do that so i just never knew i was going to achieve my dream that only did you did you ever get a chance to watch movies there because in iran they were bootlegging people were bringing movies in and all that stuff were you able to watch any movies when you were in north korea yeah i did i watched uh titanic and i that was the point it wasn't like changed my mind or none of that you know you're you're so brainwashed like it takes a long time to de-brainwash somebody too right and i think i watched the movie and first time i was watching titanic i was just so confused you know why anyone make a movie out of such a shameful story like in north korea there's no movie no songs no books about love story and the like word love doesn't exist i never seen my father saying i love you to my mom or my parents never told me they loved me only love that we knew was a written word that we could use to describe our feelings to only be a leader it wasn't a word that we can use to describe our feelings to another human being so watching that movie like where we are now a lot like you know do the kissing or holding hands in public i was so shy like they are so corrupt why would you make movie out of such a shameful story and then it was an art like you see this man like man dies for love and that eventually maybe like you know you can't actually die for someone other than dear leader or the revolution because every movie that i was seeing until that point was like you're supposed to die for the dear leader and that was the most honorable death you can get so i think that's the time and i got really tiny little taste of freedom so in america we make the government makes money through taxes right companies have jobs you know they create jobs there's corporate taxes there's sales tax there's different kind of tax and because of the citizens are you know they make a hundred thousand dollars they pay 35 000 in taxes companies they run a company they pay 223 in taxes where does revenue come for north korea to do the things that they want to do how does north korea make money where do you want me to begin they sell drugs so they literally planted drugs they are the biggest black market for weapons to the middle east they serve missiles they sell drugs uh they serve their people they do human trafficking the regime does do you know all this go to africa there are a lot of dictators north korea send their workers slave workers to build statues for african dictators and the regime served these people to go to siberia to code all those woods send them to qatar send them to poland a lot of european countries send them to china and the regime gets all the money but these people are in this kind of in when they're in the foreign place at camp and they just work for the deal leader and so treatment trafficking drug selling uh weapon selling and they do a lot of hacking cyber security they steal a lot of money through hacking they like generate billions of dollars now through hacking cyborg so that's why i'm saying like north korea you have no idea what a harm that north korea is inflicting in on the world people think oh it's nobody's business i'm not like dictated by kim jong-un it's not it's not my business but no north korea raising these armies of cyber attackers they are always hacking and stealing and selling weapons selling drugs and also the you know the people in north korea are like free slaves the regime as i said like they pay one dollar to a doctor and what do you think they're gonna like pay to uh in north korea a man needs to serve in the military mandatory military service every man who is above 138 centimeters do you know how that short is like 138 centimeters i'm not sure is that even like four feet at all the center is 30 centimeters it's not tall it's not tall i mean i'm 190 so what is 138 138 is the four four eight so like because of your notes so manufactured our height is so so so short now you're getting short and short and the regime says if anyone is above 138 centimeter let's go to military for 13 years and during the military service 13 years you are the farmer you are the constructor you do every manual labor and they don't even feed you so you are completely mannerished and that is how the regime make money by owning 25 million slaves you make them hackers you you test on them like body of medical has on them you say all crazy things on them you just abuse them and you sell them and you use them and that's how the dictator can be uh you know the god of 21st century let me ask you this when they send these folks out the slaves out to go help siberia build a statue in africa and all this stuff how often how do they hold them accountable so they don't escape and not come back so right they check through their family backgrounds they make sure their family has no like bad you know political prisoners so they checked their vigorously their family like backgrounds how royal they were and they hold their families as a hostage so they keep keep their children when this man goes to phone things they have to be married and have kids yeah they keep their child and mother wife and everybody as a hostage and they also when they go to the foreign place it's not like they are lingered to those that foreign society they build their own camp and keep it all those banners the like or do the all those like self criticism session and they cannot go outside outside the camp there are like police secret police going with them so when they go to abroad it's not like they're like us can go to supermarket whenever they want they're in the camp and they're completely completely controlled by the regime even when there is like out abroad so so it's you know you listen to this stuff and you the average viewer is going to say this sounds like a movie there's no way this is really happening and all the stuff that you're talking about it's still happening till today yes happening right now it is okay so what what got you i know with your father if you want to share what happened with your father's health but what got you to the point as a 13 year old kid to say i'm leaving i can't do this in order to go find food what what got you to that breaking point to leave it was a hunger i mean i mean like i remember like in if you leave the potatoes out it becomes frozen outside and becomes like brown and dark you know and that was only our source of food by the time when you're living and north korea is a very cold place especially where we were like it cannot get to like minus 37 celsius at night and in the winter time and there's no like heating there's no nothing or and if you go to mountains all the like trees were gone because people had to find something in nature to make fire and cook food and and by the time you're weird that point we just couldn't find it anymore like frozen potatoes and and that's why i thought like oh what do we do and we you see people like are starving to death you see and all i could see was luckily i was in the border area of north korea and i thought that was maybe last thing i'm gonna do before i die i will try to go cross that river to china and we where they had all the lights maybe i can knock on somebody's or ask for food they might be nice to give us some food because in north korea i heard so many rumors that you know in china dogs eating rice and i thought like it's almost like the humor like in a rumor you hear like they are like people living on mars you know and it was like aliens exist like that kind of rumors like how can possibly dogs eating rice in china so let me go see china and see if that's real and if i can get like some more bowl of rice and you know when you're so hungry like you actually want to die when you are eating you when you're hungry you like loses your humanity you're not human you're not savory the civility is only possible when you are fed when you are that hungry it's just no matter what you just want to eat that's like you know if you don't eat you're gonna die that's human instinct so it was like almost there's like a almost thing in north korea even the ghosts who died while they are eating they don't have any wishes so we don't feel bad for someone who were dying while they were eating that's okay if the earthquake like hits them what as long as they were eating it's okay and that's how food is like essential part for north koreans to be and the regime especially i think that is the thing i want to mention to people is that they think north korea is like poor that is why people are starving north korea is not a poor country they build like this most advanced missiles you know they build like ice i mean i think all these most advanced technical like nuclear weapons that's why america like trump goes away all the way to singapore to make kim jong-un because north korea's military power is that like threatening and they spend billions of dollars on making these nukes and the kim jong-un the kim's the dictators on purpose not to feed us because imagine if you are fat now you're going to start reading books now you're going to start thinking about the meaning of life you're going to do art you're going to do you you want to have your hobby you want to think about more than surviving so like if you keep feeding people they are not going to be obeyed you cannot you're not going to be able to control them that is why the regime so causes calculating not to feed us so all we can think is not about revolution not about freedom not about how people living it's about surviving next meal can we can we like survive until like tomorrow that's all we think as a people when you escaped and you when you went to uh china and eventually south korea what was that experience like i've read some horrific things that you experienced when you were going there with the experience of having to bury your own father at 3am in the morning and you and your mother being attacked by men and asking to you know trying to rape you and it's you again you you listen to these stories and one on one end you don't want to hear these stories because it's so hard to listen to stories especially as a man who has a kid and i'm married i got three kids i got a daughter and i'm just thinking about those thoughts but at the same time if you don't talk about it then the people around the world are not going to realize how bad things are so it's very conflicted because i'm sure you don't enjoy talking about this stuff regularly because it's constant re-reminder so if you don't mind if you're comfortable sharing with that do you mind sharing with us what were some of those things that happened to you on your way to south korea i know i think i'm so grateful what you just mentioned like you actually when you began our interview you said like oh this is a story that what cnn or msnbc or fox doesn't talk about right in to right now in china in 2020 there are about 300 north korean defectors in china right now are hiding and being sold as a human slaves right now and i was one of them we hear about this boko haram girls we talk about these girls captured by isis we give the nobel peace prize and we know these girls exist but we don't talk about the women who are being sold like the isis captures in china because china is uh everyone has economic interest in china in in this world right now so they purposely ignore us that we exist and so when i escaped to china in 2007 i was 13 years old my sister few days before me escaped i wanted to go with her but because i had a very bad stomachache my parents took me to hospital but you know in north korea we don't have like x-ray machines and see what's wrong with you literally just doctor rub your belly and say oh my god i think she got some like appendix she needs to do the surgery right now otherwise it's gonna pop this afternoon so that afternoon they cut my belly open without any painkiller and then like what they found was not even appendix it was just like infection and malnutrition that's why i had a very bad stomach ache and they still like removed my appendix i was keep fainting and it's a very common thing we just do surgery like no painkiller in north korea they like cut bones when there's no painkiller and then and what shocked me the most is like nurse in the hospital she literally uses a one meter to inject everybody and like you use like pure butters to add like a drop and you see like um dead bodies riding from house bitter like piled up and you know you see like rats eating human eyes first and you still kids chasing those rats because even rats are very precious like protein and kids eat those rats but those rats have some infection by eating human flesh at her the kids die then vets hit us back and and that's the point we thought like we gotta get out of here even if we die on the journey we are gonna get out of here so my sister escaped at 16 with her friend and a few days later as soon as i got out of the hospital my mom and i followed her to china through a broker but we didn't ask why this broker was helping us we're so desperate we didn't even like it didn't really matter why that person was helping us we were dying anyway so we crossed the frozen river to from china to and north korea to china but when i started for crossing it's like it sounds very easy crossing the river right but every few meters in north korea inside there are guards with machine guns standing there and they have the shoot to kill order so if they see anyone crossing the frozen river you don't even ask you don't need to even ask them to wait you can just shoot them and that is the order from the regime but the broker that we we were following had like drive the guards on that spot so we were able to cross it without getting shot but if you want to cross without broker you're going to get shot that's why most of north koreans cannot escape as soon we arrived in china side the first thing i was saying my mom was being raped by this chinese broker and he was trying to raid me but i just got up like i was like something 60 something pounds i'm still like 80 pounds but i was like way smaller and my mom was protecting me and then they said if you want to survive in china uh you have to be soared as uh sexual slaves it was 2007 like 21st century i never thought like we can sell human beings like dogs like puppies right they were these chinese brokers came negotiating our price like real like a puppies on the market and my mom was stored for in this 21st century for 65 dollars like less than my phone in my hand and my price was higher than hers over two hundred dollars because i was virgin so they paid less than three hundred dollars to buy me and separating me from my mom so i was got separated from my mom at 13 right there she sorted to a farmer and they sorted me out to another broker and the man who bought me he he he was already married he was a lot older than me but he said oh i want to keep you you're a virgin most of north korean girls actually by the time they go to the second broker they all raped so nobody's virgin but i fought so hard the first broker that he wasn't able to successfully to ring me so the second broker got me as a virgin i was very precious for that market i was 13 and virgin he wanted to kill me for himself and i was going to kill myself and he said oh if you become my mistress i'm going to bring your parents to me to me he was going to save my parents for me and i thought oh if i sacrifice myself i can save my father i can save my mom that's how i became his mistress at 13 and he bought my mom from a farmer that he sold previously and brought my sick father from north korea but my father was in a in a prison camp and tortured and got a colon cancer he couldn't make it uh and passed away three months later and that's when i had to bury his ashes in the middle night in china because chinese authority catches and sent us back north korea to be killed even though that goes against geneva convention that goes against in any international law that should protect political prisons like escapees because north koreans are not just like economic migrants when we escape that means we defy the regime and we become political like uh refugees so the china has a responsibility to protect us but they capture us and send us back north korea so we can be executed and tortured and sent to prison camp the only reason only way for north korean to survive in china is hiding and being sold and being raped eventually i've walked across the scoby desert from mongolia from china to mongolia in 2009 with my mom and that's how i became from from mongolia to south korea but right now there are still girls like me 10 15 years old even 10 years old are being sold in china but nobody mentions about these women exists because we don't want to accept chinese regime because they are the almighty god now they got this economic power um when you first got to china and you got the experience a little bit of freedom if you did was it china that you experienced some freedom or was it more south korea when you got a taste of it definitely south korea i mean i mean this guard these brokers even follow you to your bathroom because they don't want you to run away we are their property of course they don't treat us like humans they bought us they rape us whenever they want they say like you're less about you're like less worthy than even peak even if i kill you right now nobody gonna care nobody no police can arrest me i can kill you if if i want to kill you i can kill right now and that's what this chinese men like telling us so there is no dignity there is no freedom for us in china only way for us to be human is going to south korea or coming to america when you went to south korea and you first experienced freedom uh what what was your reaction was it i don't believe this i can't believe this is this real uh emotional tears shock what what was your reaction that you remember i think if you are being oppressed from the from your parents grandparent generation right by the time you're born you're like numb that is the like do you remember the 1984 when winston comes out he's just being numb that's what you are it's not like when you come out of north korea you don't even know what culture shock is you're like completely numb you don't even know how to make connections you don't even know what to be shocked about it's just like being completely being numbness it it even means i'm still recovering just to fear things i don't i use not feeling a lot of things and i think a lot of north koreans do feel that like you just don't fear things much and you don't even know when you're supposed to fear something right you are just not used to feeling things and all of that is surprised so first time when i was being free like was someone asking me to introduce myself and i did not know what introduction was you know in north korea nobody like introduced their steps right and they said like oh introduction is easy you say your name maybe what's your favorite like what you like to do what's your hobby if you don't even know that you can tell me what's your favorite color it's easy and in north korea like the regime told me my favorite color was red because that was a revolutionary color or i mean my favorite country was north korea because that was you know so everything was determined for me and so and in south korea suddenly they're asking me my name and like okay i say my name and they asked what's the hobby never heard like what hobby was in north korea no one can afford to have a hobby so you know being free wasn't like something easy at all it was so painful at some point i thought if someone not gonna kill me and giving me enough food in north korea like just keep giving me like frozen potatoes and no one like hurt me i actually would go back to place where everything was decided for me because you know understanding freedom was a responsibility was scary right if i choose to become let's say dancer right i have to be responsible for that choice for the rest of my life and that was insanely scary idea i had to choose unbelievable what you just said yeah free meaning being free is not easy you think it's easy and it is not i think that's why a lot of people actually asking for government to be cheating for you because i can like it is it is only a courageous person to be free and onto their own like choice and you know take that as like accountability so it is a very hard thing to do you know the way you put it especially since your entire life somebody has made decisions for you and now it's all on you so you're no longer relying on somebody where they've told you what to do now you got to decide for yourself so what do you want to do and you're kind of confused you're afraid you don't know what to do was there an element of saying oh my gosh i have too much freedom right now i kind of want to go back was there any feeling like that or not at all you were you were saying there's no i'll take anything except the life i had in north korea i definitely for sure definitely not outside north korea but the thing is that if there was some kind of miracle exists saying that the regime is not gonna kill me and give me food for the rest of my life not even good food just like frozen potatoes if that's enough then i'm like i would go back that's what i said i was like and some defectors believe it or not do go back oh i i i totally understand i totally get that part what was the tipping point for you where you said i think i got this i think i can stand on my own two feet and i think i'm going to go out there and spread my wings was it was it books was it a friend was it a teacher was it a professor was it a co-worker what was it i think to change somebody's life i don't know like a lot of people say like oh this is the moment i changed my life but course books was the beginning i think in south korea i was so discriminated by south koreans um the books was only the one that i could like rely on and the also the thing another challenge is that you know when when i were arrived in south korea these people saying oh korean war started by kim kim sung by north koreans it's like that was started by south and american ambassadors what are you talking about and they say oh kim's are not gods they're just dictators and at some point i was like i had trusting issues like so if everything that i believed until like this point was a lie how do i know that you are not lying like it is there's a question like if it's right now right i'm coming to you like patrick everything you believe is a lie do not believe anything and then you're gonna be like how do i know you're not lying to me then everybody told him it was live right it was like that and then i couldn't trust people and that's when i read george orr's animal farm and then i read 1984 afterwards and i was like oh this makes sense this really makes sense and then i started reading more and getting to more things and living things and understanding what happened but until that point i just like i don't know i i don't think i can trust anyone again which character in animal farm did you relate to the most i mean obviously there's the pigs and the napoleon and all the donkey who did you relate to the most do you remember the the last uh towards the end there's new pigs are being born and they don't know what life was like before that was me i my grandma knew what it was like before kim my leave my grandmother lived under the japanese culinary colonization so she she worked before him but because they kept silent by the time when i was born my universe was kim my the human human evolution started the kim like in north korea the calendar begins with the kimura song's birthday yes to taiwan that is our canon the kimura song when he was born that's when north korean calendar starts we have a different time that even other we our time begins differently and we have a saying we don't we are not asians we are not like some east asian we are kimurasang people we are keemer song race that's what they say we are kimura some race we are not asians in north korea so in that book i was i felt i wasn't like angry for my grandma generation who kept styling but it was so sad by that new generation that new pigs don't even know the time before what it was like and that's when i realized oh that's what happened to me and i think this is why i need to understand what my grandma went through what my parents went through what i am going through uh fascinating by the way uh did kim get the kim young i mean his family his father did they think they're god is that how they saw themselves like is it a second coming how do they view themselves i is it more profit or is it more god oh it definitely prof i mean definitely god it's not a prophet lover it's like uh kim your son is a god the almighty god who can do perfectly anything like you when the bible explains you are like you're a mere human being you cannot understand the god's the perception you cannot challenge god's logic you got all this higher logic right so it's like why there's misery that's god's way then it expands everything you don't need the logic to explain god's way so that is what they do like we don't need to ask for logic or making any sense because it's god we cannot understand possible gods that fire impression so they only can do that when they are being god you know there was a movie i don't know if you've seen the book of eli you ever seen a movie book of eli with denzel washington or nowhere he's blind and he has this book that he has to touch and that's how he reads the bible and this one man is trying to get the bible because back then people weren't reading and he said if i can get the bible i can control people's minds but i can't teach them how to read because if they stay dumb i can control them and lead them it just takes me there but but you and i when you and i were talking offline i was showing this painting i showed you these two different books and you said you read both of them one of them is communist manifesto the other one is at the shruck by iran and the other one is by karl marx you had a chance to read both of them yes i read eighty percent and i shrugged okay it's a big book it's a very big book i read five times of commerce manifesto not because it was good i because in north korea i was like i just couldn't i just wanted to read that but why this book this ideology killed that many people in this world nothing has killed more than communism the mile killed 50 to 60 million people i mean can you like stalin nothing not even nazism not even like not in poverty not even even nuclear war nothing cared more than communism in this world in human history and that's why i was like i just had to read this this damn thing like what was this that killed destroyed my people destroyed my killed my father it came to my father and and just it just i just had to read it and reading reading and just make no sense and then it's like i just stopped there it's like okay there's no point of me keep reading because i just want you to understand the mindset why they were doing this but it just uh it's just so evil you sound like so nice but what what when it comes to soul evilness the greed of power control and you do not respect the very the you don't trust the human decency and you believe you have to control them and like collectives and all of this is like completely disrespect the human dignity why do you think the concept of socialism and communism and folks like bernie sanders or aoc or even the younger crowd that's coming up right now the other day an article came out from harvard saying 57 of the youth except socialism as a way and they think capitalism is bad why do you think in a country where you and i couldn't wait to get to because this is our dream right all these freedoms you know why do you think this concept of socialism and communism is so attractive in the u.s educational system with many politicians today in america saying america's a bad country i mean i read an article that came out yesterday written by business insider by margaret ward what's her last name margaret's uh something like that where she set the top five best countries to raise kids in and the top five worst countries to raise kids in i think the top five worst la fifth place was bulgaria fourth place was turkey i don't remember who third place was second place was us as the worst country to raise kids in and first place was mexico and and this whole concept of americans bashing america that we should go to european or socialism or communism is not really that bad why do you think that's happening in america and how do you view it when people start saying things like that i actually haven't known i think i can understand why some people are saying that because you know communism was tried and whenever it was tried they failed right but people bought it at that time like people started following lenin and like like they all did they followed they bought the idea so i can't see how appealing the idea is got it and especially to young people who a lot of people don't pay when you're young don't pay taxes right you don't work you don't actually understand how the economy really works and also i think because now life is so easy right like when you're born your mother is so low especially in the u.s i think this generation expects life to be easy that's what their expectation is and like you and i know we you're going iran i was born in north korea you you know that our ancestors from go back into the time life was so difficult for them people like fantasize about old days like no all day people died from cancer so many different things and now there's a lot of cancers can even cure but here in america people say like doctors say colon cancer a lot of times it can be cured my father never had to die if he was in freedom he only died because he was he was incarnate socialists committed china and communist societies north korea and i think just the only thing is that i mean if there's no capitalism the people i'm sure you're gonna see this gonna criticize they're not gonna have youtube they're not gonna have twitter without capitalism how any of this is possible capitalism is making it available for us to have all of this have excessive food have opportunity have all the device that we own today even even zoom do you think you can find zoom in north korea no there's no skype in north korea we like capitalism how do we have any of this and i think this they don't and i think for me it's like just i don't i mean like if you worship communism association that much just go to north korea why don't you just immigrate to north korea because like everyone wants to come to us that's why everyone's coming here and all these people like why don't you open the border and give all everybody citizenship and let them in right that's how demanding americans are american citizenship is so i mean do north korea have that problem so if those people really want that kind of system i think they just should immigrate to those places because like you know i mean that is my ideology if you're going to worship to me about like the grainy socialism go to north korea it is the last country that pure holds this ideology so it's it's that easy like it's not nurture is not that far away in in our planet they can go and have their dream of this being socialist yeah i mean you know when it comes from somebody like you who has seen things a lot you have lived the life of thousands of people in oneness not the life i mean you can't compare the things you witness in your eyes like if somebody was to close their eyes they created technology to connect my brain to yours and within a five minute period i can witness all the things you've witnessed the level of pain my body would go to i probably would pass out if i was able to witness the stuff that you've seen with your own eyes painful stuff you talk about that doesn't sound real to the average person that you only see this stuff in a movie but you've experienced it so your point of view is coming from a different point of view and sometimes when you're born in america in in the most incredible country in the world that people have not seen anything else all they want to see is the things that it does wrong they have no club batteries in other places and how many people would love to come to a place like this you know one thing i was wondering about you was you said something you said you know i mean i could not trust men again i hated men i hated humanity how on earth can people sell each other right and today you're you're married and you have a kid you got married i think in 2018 to a gentleman named ezekiel if i'm saying it correctly yes and and uh how how did that transition for you take place you know sometimes people go through a bad breakup they'll say oh he cheated on me i will never date another guy ever again they're all dogs they're all this uh i mean you you were you experienced tremendous pain how were you able to go through this pain to say i can love another man and continue with my life how do you go through that transition i think so i am married to american bastard the american bastards i learned to care and hate we do everything i had he's american bastard he is like has a european heritage too so he's pure pure monster in the eyes of north korean regime i would be like death too right now to marry to them is international is not marriage is not a lot in north korea and i have a son with him and in my son's birth certificate it says mother is north korean and father is american and when i got that birth certificate like more than two years ago in chicago hospital this is a pure miracle you know this is only possible in a country like america it is only possible in freedom and that a baby half north korean and american can be born that is only few countries in those world we can do that is america as a rape victim i was raped i was shamed in south korea as a colored person as a refugee as a defector and all of those things i have been welcomed by this country and people in this country i think when i came to america i met like gay men right he's like my step brother but in north korea i never heard the gay was like there's nowhere to get in dictionary so when he like met me here hulk gave me hug i was like don't worry baby i'm gay and i was like what the heck is he talking why are you even hugging me like it's and i went on time i looked it up gay and i was like oh that's what it meant but i think just being in this country seeing people just accepted who they are and i think that was a point of me to overcoming it but it was just so many people's kindness it was really so many people like you you know sympathizing my story and wasn't saying that i was dirty or like any of that i think you're just really meeting a lot of good kind people open-hearted people i think that here to me and by the time when i my husband of course in the beginning i was very suspicious i thought like you know my first time being with men was being raped how can i possibly think of anything good of them but i think you know eventually with a lot of support and love i overcame it and now i have a son and wonderful son and i my father was a man too and i think it was you know when you're traumatized you cannot be really rational that is the i think most difficult part you cannot really tap into your logic fear comes regarded and you are very scared but i think really also understanding what trauma was you know i never knew what trauma was until coming to america and really understanding what trauma does to your brain and your your feelings all of it really helped me to overcome a lot of my you know past experience well that that that says a lot about your character says a lot about your character of who you are and i salute you for that because that's not easy to do especially for somebody like you and that means a part of it also means how much you love your father you know it's it's to to be able to have a fond memory of your father where you say other men like him are out there that are willing to do anything for their daughter that says a lot about who your father was and obviously i don't know the story about your father but it says a lot about who your father was you know you you said something about trump earlier when he went and met with kim yong-goon how do you view trump uh from this point of view so i kind of want to kind of set the whole thing up and you tell me how you view him so here's a man in america who's the president the most powerful man in the world today and on one end he goes and meets with with kim young to try to potentially prevent him and persuade him to not do any kind of nuclear because south korea is a ally and we have military bases in south korea army has camp casey and you know he's trying to negotiate to kind of get him on his side trump is and you know how you view him because you live there you know exactly what life is like living there and so to see him go there saying why would you go meet with the modern day let's just say hitler you you've said that before but then on the other side you see him go after china that has uh hurt a lot of people a lot of underground you know concentrate a lot of things that you read about that almost again doesn't seem real and you see a lot of people in america that are afraid of saying anything bad about china because they either have business dealings or they're making money or if it's whether it's hollywood nb or some politicians so here's the same man that on one side meets with the dictator that you lived under and at the same time goes against a regime that everybody fears china how do you view how trump's doing as a president when it comes down to these two relationships i'm so glad you asked that question because this is like what i learned i think from my journey of course i learned to be how to survive but i think one thing that i learned the most is like really what it means to be a human right most of things in life is not black and white of course like hitler was pure black evil i do think someone is pure evil there are some things we cannot discuss either is black or white right some things i think we have to make them like they are completely black you know they are evil but most of things are not and i think even the man who bought me who raped me at 13 who i wanted to care but he eventually freed me to go to south korea that's what humans are like we are complex creatures i forgive that man who bought me and raped me and i i actually even helped that man who sent to prison and when he got out of the prison in china 10 years later i helped him that's how i forgave him for that but i think with the trump too i think a lot of people think because i criticized trump for north korea with the one meeting that doesn't make trump fool black it's it's uh i definitely understand trump's side why he is from business background and he doesn't understand when he meets a head of state the connotation in it in north korean people's mind if a leader of free world meets our leader later that makes our jitter be a little very legit trump i'm sure not get that as much and i'm sure also he is a deer maker he used to make a lot of beers so he thought without even north korea's any preconcession he can go in and maybe convince kim jong-un and come to out of the entertainer but i think but because he is a united i mean the president of this country i do have a higher expectation for him given north korea history this regime kept this going for over 70 years less than 20 over 20 years it's gonna be hundred years one century north korea has been doing this so trump cannot be just going in like one setting i'm gonna convince this guy out of 70 years of this history gonna ask him to change that's not gonna happen so that is the part that i was criticizing trump for but that does not mean i was criticizing every single thing that trump was doing as a president and i think it goes to obama it goes to any president i do think there are pres every president has pros and cons they do sometimes make mistakes they do right things so it's not like i you know go against everything that trump does but i do completely understand that the effect the negative fact that trump brought for the for the summit because that made kim jong-un even power forgotten you know even though the most powerful country's backing is their leader and he you know complimenting him someone saying like he's a love he's people loving him and you know he's a great leader he's a tough guy and that video to north korean people and saying like look at him even though american presidents are worshiping our dear leader and that was the problem that with the the tourists going into north korea do you know there used to be a lot of tourists going into north korea the western like a lot of western tourists went to north korea it's almost like uh visiting you know these concentration camps you know people are like enslaved but you have money you can go and sing this like uh the zoo or like you know the roller coaster place the kingdom created for you to see so when you go to touring north korea you only can't go see the guy the places that regime allows you to see you have to go to the guys you cannot and do you remember like the auto reindeer the american college boy eventually died because he was trying to get like the tour is happening and they have no freedom whatsoever but when these people go they have to bow in front of statue of kim and kim jong kim jongier and that shows the north koreans they say everybody wants to be like north korea everybody wants to come to north korea look at this white people look at them bowing from statue of dear leaders they respect their leaders more than like we do so that's how lucky we are to have our dear leaders so that all information being back played that is the why i was really against trump going to mid north korea kim jong without any concession without any much planning and look at it what the result i mean i sat there nothing can happen nothing happened so that is the really only like context of me engaging with like his policy how do you how do you view on how he is challenging and pushing and uh you know giving a hard time with tariffs and bans and all this other stuff when it comes down to china and the way he's been dealing with china i do i mean i do wish i mean of course trump when it comes to china i mean i do agree communist chinese regime is the biggest threat to humanity right now i mean we talk about like climate change we talk about a lot of the even pandemic but the harm that they cause is not as little as the chinese community regime does to so many places in this world there are muslims and going into concentration camps right now you see these millions of muslims right these minority groups they are being sent to prison camp there's a massive the violation of privacy on chinese people and then people speak out i think i do think try and trump did a lot of raising that issue but i wish he does also focusing on human rights angle it's not all about just business trying to bring the business back to america and save the economy but i do wish that he also understands how the regime chinese comes regime is like backing backing this terrorist north korea and keeping its 25 million people as a slaves and how they also in other regions like women from burma and like me and other regions are sent to china to be married with farmers in china right now because of the one child policy their lack of women and that is why i was being sold as a child bride in china but north korean women are not the only women being sold as a prize a lot of other countries women are also being affected by this you know chinese the one child policy and all of this current policy so i think i think just i hope that trump you know i mean he's doing a lot already on china but i hope we keep doing it and doing more and bringing more issues and bringing lies to on other issues that people didn't know where in the past so so ideally what would you like to see happen so you know what's going on in north korea and you know what's going on in china ideally ideally what would you like to see happen that's possible of happening and how does trump or anybody go about making this become a reality when it comes to saving north korea one is one is to to show the world what is going on with north korea instead of being an ally because the threat is if trump pushes too hard kim young is capable of doing anything he's capable of you know putting a nuclear uh war you know a bomb in south korea and then that's going to be on his hands so if he pushes too hard kim young may do something so how do you go about addressing this challenge that's taking place in north korea as well as what's going on with trafficking and human rights in china so i think that is um so north korea only exists because of chinese communist party no country in the world can have a trade with north korea because the dictatorship it's been like banned by the u.n resolution so china does go against the u.n resolution and keep aiding north korea regime i'm not saying people the region when i also i think one thing that people keep confusing is that we never said communist party is very different from the chinese people i love chinese people i love chinese food i speak chinese i love everything about china i love all of their like inventions in history but i'm talking about right now the current regime the communist party and that party almost sponsors dictatorship in north korea the one thing gonna change north korea is cutting the oil imagine there's no north korea is not oil producing country if you stop giving them oil how they're going to test the messiah how they're going to keep building missiles china is giving them more so north korea is keep building missiles and advance their technology when it comes to weapons i'm not saying cutting the food i'm not saying cutting medical supplies cutting the oil so north korea cannot build any more missiles but china is keep giving them more and i think that is why people just don't know what a threat the chinese communist party and north korean regime is to the world that is doable i mean china was the first president to brought that north to south china north korea we need to talk to china it is very true because you know if you solve the relationship with china china yourself north korea right away but they they use almost like north korea as kind of uh you know buffer zone from democracy coming into china from south korea and japan and america so eventually you i do think american president whoever comes in next or even trump is gonna be they need to focusing on negotiating with china even on north korea on everything because china got the all the right kids and if china cuts down that oil supply north korea going to collapse because how do you leader going to drive his car to visit his luxury resort how does all these elite officials in kangan gonna drive around having their meetings no one can do anything and if china wants to help people give them food food is fine but don't give them more don't give them anything that helps breeding news but but china doesn't they keep out they keep going against and giving them all all the time wow and how easy it is so so if i understand you correctly is if china doesn't support north korea no one else in the world is going to help and support north korea well but it can okay because because of you and everybody can't yeah nobody is go or breaking the laws so like only china like illegally trading with north korea so china's the only one that goes against the u.n resolution that we have that they go out and they say we're going to help them out anyway help them out anyways whether you like it or not we're going to do that okay now china just brokered a deal with iran for 400 billion dollars and we know what that deal is all about this is just the last month you can go look it up it's a 400 billion dollar deal with iran it's a long-term relationship so you know who iran's against everybody including u.s you just saw a deal that happened yesterday with israel and uae and uh uh uh uh am i saying it right uh uae yes you're not arab yes and then then you're seeing china now support so it doesn't seem like the right way for trump do negotiating with north korea means nothing because nothing's gonna get done the only way to get anything done with north korea is to get things done with china yes so step number one for you would be to help anything with human trafficking or human rights or socialism communism any of that stuff is making sure the pressure is put more on china and forget about north korea because if you solve china then you're going to be fine with north korea is that am i hearing you correctly exactly i think people think like there's no way we're going to talk over to kim jong-un and convince he changed his mind he's not going to change his minds the elites in north korea are like living like kings imagine being a being of god in 21st century with all kinds of next like you know these technological events the best i mean sure king ever exists in human history so they're not gonna give that up and i think only way we can achieve that goal is through chinese communist party but so far they are they don't care about human rights they don't care about freedom they don't care about anything they just care about their status goal and maintaining whatever they've been doing this stability and that stability means there's no power what happened what is happening to north koreans that is what the u.n said the only resemblance we find what is happening to north korean people is the you know nazi the hitler time or like stalin soviet union those concentration camps north korea the country is a concentration camp the entire country started with like wire fences you don't think like yeah of course inside there's another more worse consensus neighbors but like nobody can leave north korea without permission and only if you can leave the country and you cannot go to north korea right now and see i do say like there are people like elon musk wants to go to like in a different planet and like you know occupy mars i mean the moon right i do think somehow we might go to the like universe you know the different planet before we land north korea fully as a human race that's how north korea is like left you know out from the rest of the humanity and i do think it is time to bring them to our human race and as we moving forward how can we leave 25 million like there in that darkness like what does that to say our morality right like i do think this is a challenge that anyone should ask like even the u.s president they should they should like it is so sad like how this country is being like this for over 70 years and still like all this political interest everything comes first and just like these issues are being buried completely like this let me let me first of all you got to be nominated for nobel prize have they ever contacted you have you ever spoken anybody about nobel prize because no no no you have you have you have what you've experienced and what you're talking about that's gotten hundreds of millions of views which at this point if you combine facebook say billion plus views it's something that the world needs to know more about and i think there needs to be a form of nomination on your end but have you ever spoken to anybody from trump's camp or no has anybody from trump's camp ever reached out to you or no i i mean not from his campaign directly i did i mean when when hillary clinton was running the campaign i met her and she wanted to do so i mean she was going to do some but you know everybody says that i met like nancy pelosi and she was like oh i really have my heart for nursing people i want to do something for it but it is all politicians saying it and i don't think anyone here genuinely caring what people are going through in oppression right there are so many people are oppressed and i think it is nobody's interest they just want to do what is like politically right what is it if the more likes and votes i think there are more people i think there are more people and i i uh the right people watch this channel just so you know uh and uh we're gonna make sure they get a chance to at least hear your side of the story and find a way to get a hold of you because every time i you know i've interviewed a lot of people i've sat down with president bush i've sat down with politicians billionaires millionaires athletes celebrities hollywood con artists you know mobsters it doesn't matter i've sat down with everybody i've sat down with so many different personalities and i just enjoy getting to know people and hearing people's stories every single time i ask you a question and i said i don't know if our answer is going to have that much depth in it let's see how layer of deep your answer is going to be okay and most people go two layers deep three layers deep every question i ask you your answer's depth was so deep where i'm walking away learning from you and i'm 15 years young older than you i think you're 26 are you 26 now or you're 26 years old now and uh uh very very fascinating what what are some of your aspirations i know you've written a book i know you're have this book out which we're going to put the link below for people to be able to go out there and get it in order to live we'll put the link below i think on amazon it has 17 1800 reviews and it's all five star people obviously love it from reading and we've only had an hour and a half hour 20 minutes to go through stuff but what are some of your aspirations because you with your life experience and what you've done you got a very big upset i'm just curious to know what some of your aspirations are i think two things i think i won at this point i mean in the past it was like as you said right i felt like i was i lived for a thousand years i've i felt like so exhausted i feel so old and i'm like only 26 too and having a baby changed a lot about it but and one is definitely helping my people because um it does like heartbreak right in america our problem is having too much and never understood having too much could be a problem and also having no problem can be a problem too and i just never understood this like it's really i just see this here like having too much and having no problem is a problem and how do i keep my perspective and not getting into this this universe of you know complaining about having too much and having not having actual real problems and i think that's what my goal trying to maintain my route some of them is really bad i do want to get rid of those like the tradition that i learned from the regime i do want to get rid of it but some of them i do want to preserve is really keeping that perspective and i want to help my people because you know they are do you know how many north korean defectors right now in america from that's over 70 years of time 200. like 200 made into america from north korea like what is the mathematical chance of me crossing the desert coming here in america and speaking and talking to you right right now and i am not religious but i do think i do feel that responsibility i do think i don't feel that special chosen one because just mathematically doesn't make any sense and as someone i think not i mean we exist we live we this uh these victims do exist of this human trafficking and this regime but you don't see a lot of like the factors coming like iran you know a lot of i know a lot of actors from from iran the women's like rights but not from north korea because one even after they escaped i spoke you saw that video right in 2014 i gave everyone young words oh thank you two months later i don't even two months later north korean regime captured all my family my nephews my cousins even my neighbors anyone knew me put into propelling the video on youtube and they all got vanished because i spoke out after my escape so you think like i'm free right now but i'm not free defectors after they escape they are not still free they are their assassin of they actually regime you know like kim jong-nam got like poisoned kim jong king the brother of kim jong in malaysia he poisoned his brother in where there's cctvs of course he doesn't care killing a defector who cares nobody gonna bother him so he cares a lot of the factors who speak out not only than the family members was left behind so the vectors when they escape and speak out they still pay so much price to have the voice and have this presence unlike a lot of other countries when they escape they are almost like done with their country and they can like move forward but the factors also we cannot move forward we still like get right i i'm on the top like list of the regime kim jong of course won't scare me and i think that's why i do want to be free someday from this region from this together completely so i can say whatever i want and i don't get that threats and no one dies in my family because what i say i think my journey to freedom still continues i think i'm gonna fight until i die until i completely free from this dictator and also i do want to be you know grateful and happy here because that's where we are and i think life is about being grateful i don't think every day i try not to be bitter and i i try to be just so grateful i think when my sister i found her seven years later she was so bitter and she has just like self-pity going on and i was like you know what is the point of you surviving all of that insanity through and now you're here you're complaining about what you've gone through like i remember like my when i was writing my book my publisher said like you mean you're traumatized you have to get some therapy it's like what's the therapy and like you know she told me oh here people having difficulties they have to go like therapy and then i ask okay so how much is it it was in yo it was like over 20 dollars per hour i was like no way i can afford it no thank you for therapy i didn't get therapy i think their pizza if you can get it's a great but my point is that like it was so hard to survive it didn't make it this far and i am not gonna be like here like complaining about how difficult it was you know and i think that is what i want my people to do when they come out of this tunnel they don't feel bad about what they've gone through but they're just grateful oh first of all i think you're just getting warmed up what you're gonna do in the world i think your impact is just getting warmed up there are certain people that you talk to you can tell some tell a story and yes they want to share the story but some are true believers at the highest level you are a true believer and true believers are dangerous i'm not surprised why north korea is not happy with you because it doesn't sound like you're going to stop until you get what you want and people like that are very hard to find most people would just go and just want to be quiet and just live a regular life and not say anything because they don't want more uh trouble but to have courage at the level that you have aristotle said the highest level of quality for a human being to have is courage and you have that and that says a lot about the fabric of your character and i applaud you and i salute you for being who you are and i thank you once again for making some time and being a guest on valuetainment and i look forward to bringing you back again when other events takes place to talk to you because this has truly been a distinct pleasure of mine to have a conversation with you it's been amazing so thank you so much for your time it's been a real honor thank you so much patrick now obviously this is probably one of the most unique interviews we've ever done for somebody to give the experience of what it is to live in north korea for 13 years and escape and go to china then go to south korea then come over here then be somebody that read as much as she did and to get herself to this point what an inspirational story right what an inspirational story i want to hear your thoughts comment below i got two other videos i want you to watch if you enjoy this one one of them is with an attorney that was in china for 20 years as an attorney gordon chang if you've not seen this he explains the conditions in china in ways you probably never heard before and the other one is with uh from epoch times where i sat with one of the reporters where he explained the methods china's using and how they're treating their people that nobody else is hearing about click on either one of them that you want to watch and if you've not subscribed to the channel please do so thanks
