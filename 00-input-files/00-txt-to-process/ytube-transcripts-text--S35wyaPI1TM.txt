two beautiful women one of the world's deadliest poisons and a paranoid dictator's plot to kill his rival it's a chilling story of espionage and intrigue worthy of a gripping spy novel steve penns reports on this audacious and very public airport assassination how north korea's crazed leader kim jong-un recruited these two women to get rid of his latest threat his unsuspecting half-brother [Music] murder doesn't get more brazen than this an assassination carried out by two young women in full view of the world they're putting out a very clear message we can kill anybody we like anywhere in the world the killing ordered by a ruthless dictator using a weapon of mass destruction it's the most toxic substance that man has ever made the target was a pudgy unassuming 45 45-year-old korean kim jong-nam half-brother of north korea's deranged leader kim jong-un you could imagine kim jong-un saying i will wipe out anyone who could conceivably be a potential danger to the dictator his brother had always been a threat because of his closeness to their father the previous ruler of this totalitarian state what kind of person orders the execution of their own brother kim jong-un i don't know what kind of people but he killed already a few hundred people sometimes no only gun hanging up you know hanging you know he killed the mushinger sometimes they cannot kill this is a terrible guy isn't it he's a crazy guy alex huang owns a korean restaurant in kuala lumpur and may have been the closest thing kim jong-nam had to a friend why would kim jong-un want his brother dead many reasons number one number one vision is blood i cannot tell you because you will follow me the blood ties put a target on the half-brother's back kim jong-un has been ruthless in holding on to power killing hundreds of potential rivals including his own uncle he had him lined up on a mountain and there was an anti-aircraft gun just blasted him out of existence as a sadistic streak in the present leader glen mortrania harvey is a former british intelligence officer he and his colleagues at mi6 believe the latest assassination was a dictator removing a potential threat to his rule what you're describing is extreme paranoia absolutely at every point and the thing is that uh some say well he's a madman and not a madman well you don't uh laugh or disregard a madman and the assassination of kim jong-nam was bizarre in the extreme a plot that began with a search for a pair of hit women to do the job it's not the first place you'd look for an assassin but it's here in the heart of kuala lumpur nightclub district where a group of north korean agents recruited two young women for their mission the girls claimed they were duped into thinking they were taking part in an innocent prank but were they really as naive as they say or were they willing participants in a murder [Music] behind closed doors there's a thriving sex trade in conservative malaysia an industry that draws thousands of young women from neighbouring countries one who sought a new life in kuala lumpur was 28 year old dante huang who'd appeared on tv talent shows in her native vietnam [Music] but left to work in malaysia in what she called an entertainment outlet another arrival was 25 year old indonesian seti icia who found work in a massage parlor she was approached to take part in a tv prank show by a young man called james siti was to rub oil on the faces of strangers what she appears to me is like a very naive girl gui is city's lawyer he says she saw other women being trained for this supposed tv show and was paid 100 a time to perform the prank at shopping malls around kuala lumpur do you think the pranks were training her for assassination without her knowledge personally i think that what they are trying to do is to see how this girl can do the prank and how well they can do it and eventually they will select people who they think can perform better on february 13th this year ct was instructed to go to kuala lumpur's international airport to perform the prank she claimed she didn't know don too hong the vietnamese girl who was there on the same mission a senior north korean agent who called himself chang was there to supervise and this time there was something different about the liquid she was given [Music] the oil was still same safe for the smell she said it smelled like oil from the mechanical it was different to the previous oil the smell was different the liquid was different it was vx a nerve agent and a weapon of mass destruction tell me about vx vx is is the ultimate chemical weapon less than a pinhead size of the x is enough to kill a grown person chemical weapons expert hamish de breton gordon believes north korea is one of only a handful of countries with the capability to manufacture vx we now know that the north koreans have made and produced vx and could have up to 5 000 tons of the stuff in in north korea the stage was set this is kim jong-nam arriving at the airport for his flight to macau he checks in under the alias kim chol three other north korean agents now join chang at a coffee shop opposite the czech encounters they settle in to watch was this a murder that the north koreans wanted to happen quietly or was it something that was staged for the world to see i'm standing on the exact spot where kim jong-nam met his fate and i'm surrounded by cctv cameras but that didn't seem to bother the killers the two women approached from different directions and in that cafe over there four north korean agents with ringside seats to the execution it all happens in a few seconds kim jong-nam reels away from the attack shocked seemingly dazed he staggers to the information counter and is helped downstairs to the airport medical center where he collapses as the poison does its work once it touched his body uh particularly his face where you've got mucus membranes like the eye and the mouth that would be very quickly absorbed that would appear to be absorbed within him and then vx did it did its trick shut his nerves down and he he died in 10 minutes as kim jong-nam lies dying downstairs in the medical center the killers are making their escape the two assassins head out the front door and back into kuala lumpur the four north korean agents straight through departures and onto a flight their final destination pyongyang home malaysian police arrested the two young women and began to follow the poison trail back to pyongyang a charge the north korean government angrily rejects that north korea tried to make the point by assassinating him that's ridiculous and that's being said as a truth not as a suspicion in a cast of unlikely characters alejandro cao de bono is surely the most bizarre cow a spaniard is special representative of the north korean foreign ministry and claims the police not only have the wrong suspect they don't even have the right victim you're saying this wasn't kim jong-nam this was not kim jong-nam so who was murdered in the airport kim chol citizen kim chol in all his documents in his passport why would someone want to assassinate kim cho we don't know the reasons we don't know we try to clarify why someone killed this person if he was really killed if it was not a plot from their own cio or south korean intelligence and with a nerf agent supposed to be a weapons of much of mass destruction which is ridiculous as far as western intelligence is concerned the plot was devised by kim jong-un who purposely ordered the use of vx poison to send a message to the world do you think they want us to know they've got this absolutely i think they want to they want to be part of you know the sort of wmd weapons of mass destruction or weapons of mass terror club i think they're saying look you know we are a serious player here you can no longer ignore us does north korea have vx nerve agent but that's a question to be made to an official in charge of the army i'm a cultural representative if i knew that it will be quite strange or ridiculous so would it be fair to say if you're not briefed on whether north korea has chemical weapons you wouldn't be briefed on whether an assassination happened in an airport in kuala lumpur no i it's not i will not be don't try to find a way to try to make your point to accuse our country you are just trying like a snake to sneak around and found all kind of excuses i told you it's not that i have to be briefed it's just a matter of logic and a matter of how we operate our way of thinking in north korea is never that way and we never work in that way it now seems all the north korean agents have escaped sanction three suspects holed up in the north korean embassy in kuala lumpur have been allowed to leave the country excuse me excuse me could you talk can we talk but the two young women charged with murder seem doomed siti is adamant she's innocent but that may not save her is she scared now about what will happen of course she's scared because now that she's been charged with murder what's the penalty she's facing in malaysia if you're a child for murder there's only one penalty that is death by hanging no other penalty and even if the women were to somehow walk free they may forever be themselves a target i've been a lawyer for 37 years and this is the first time my client ever wear blue proof vest to the court they think she's a target of course likely to be from north korea why would they want to kill her then they would have silencer and as for the rest of us well we know they have weapons of mass destruction now they've shown their willingness to use them how far would north korea go to protect its interests i will try to say it with the word we used to say in korea okay the phrase is that there will be no world without korea so it will go all the way if north korea is attacked you can expect nuclear war and a nuclear war that will obviously affect all the all the world [Music]
