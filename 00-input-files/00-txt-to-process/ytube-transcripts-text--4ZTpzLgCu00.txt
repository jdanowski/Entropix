[Music] [Music] yes major i know convoy circus tiger was destroyed on high road at coordinates k-7 they must be zeroed in on a quarter mile of that bend i'm holding crazy fox at b8 sir it would be useless to start crazy fox until that gun is knocked out they know we're road bound yes i realize that i'm sending out a team now yes sir we'll roll the convoy o 700 regardless yes sir well there it is they put a cork in our bottle right there and these supplies must reach dog company within 24 hours up there to hold that ground no chance for an air drop to dog company that's all they do is drop it country's too rough can't get a chopper in either but if we could that take too long to move this much gas and ammo we're stuck with it our only chance their only chance is to get that gun and start these trucks moving the only way to get it is to go up after it lieutenant collins you and sergeant walsh take four men from the convoy find that gun and put it out of action it should be here just like that you must hit it before 100 because this convoy will roll at 0.700 those three hours will put us in their range now after the hit if you can make it come down to the road it's approximately two miles and pretty rough if you can't join us in time there's a small trail head west from this ridge that trail was probably used to supply this gun we found it in aerial photos it runs to this road such as it is follow it it'll lead you to field hospital 101 you can get transportation back to base questions no sir sergeant do we have any more information that should their firepower the report said heavy mortar fire no doubt machine guns too though it isn't mentioned i know this is sketchy but it's all we've got thank you sir get your men lieutenant you better leave as soon as possible be daylight an hour yes sir lieutenant this is going to be a tough one i think we better take the corp i'll pick my men sergeant i thought we'd play it safe and pick it yeah figures you'd play it safe i don't know what you're talking about in your mess kit you don't i'm talking about you leaving that patrol at taegu scouting on your own wasn't it at least that's what the report said every man in that patrol was wiped out except five you and these four lieutenant if we miss taking that gun every man in this patrol will roll right into it these are the men i want sergeant i have them assembled with full pack rations for two days and two canteen fall in in 10 minutes yes sir oh and sergeant i'll get that gun you can bet your life on it i am sir collins you were pretty rough on the sergeant maybe not rough enough sir is that the reason you selected those particular men i know what you're thinking captain but these are the only men i've got none of the rest have had any combat experience they've only been off the base after dark they haven't even zeroed in on their rifles yet all right good enough yes sir walker yeah sword you'd like to take a little walk what's

mountain we gotta climb well there's a lot of mountain we haven't used lot of mountain hey sarge can't you talk to the lieutenant that gun's on the other side of the ridge small fire for coffee to be safe i'll try lieutenant sergeant this has been a tough march and we still got a long ways to go the men could sure use some hot coffee i don't you think a small fire safe considering how far off the gun is you may be right sergeant but like i said no fires lieutenant no fire sergeant yes sir lieutenant says no fire where i come from you couldn't eat in the same restaurant with me and just think we might share the same grave your two guys knock it off that war is over let's try to be around when this one is ain't no attention to real bear serge every time his mouth gets in gear his brakes fail [Applause] uh is that a bible no not exactly it's a prayer book a prayer book huh today sunday no i don't think so not they say that stuff for cindy some do i took a fling at religion what the fling yeah as uh as back home i was out of work oh oh eyes flat broke you know nothing in sight and uh well i never was one much for church going you know but uh i just was walking down this street one rainy night and just to get in out of the rain while i walk in this neighborhood pool hall you know to kind of pick up a little change there and it uh it must have been fate because i sitting there and i picked up this magazine off a chair that was next to me that's not gonna do it you know how you do it that's when it hit me a large prayer big bold type i knew right then that that was it well well i i've worried some money see and i bought one of these machines that stamps a large prayer on a penny and oh hey things was going great there's carnival but then uh i stopped by the fbi fbi

still carry one uh for luck you know i uh right there about that oh hey serge you've been through this kind of stuff before now what's it gonna be like we have to start shooting that's hard to say well uh i've been in action before but i've never had to shoot right at anybody just like war games when we use real bullets so are the gooks well i i just hope i don't freeze up back home in school before a game started football you know i get so scared i couldn't move once the game started my eyes okay yeah they alright i i ain't worried about getting hurt i just don't want to goof up and cause anybody else to get it you should've joined the band boy don't worry about it hey stop yeah now supposing we find this gun and supposing we luck out and blast it then what we're going to join the convoy well it depends on what time time what time after we get the gun and if there's still time we can cut back to the main road and pick up the convoy well if not well they say we can cut back over the ridge pick up a supply trail and make our way to field hospital field hospital out here that's right 101. hmm well that'll be better than joining up with dog company they must be getting the hell shot out of them all right man let's go i'll be all right paddy daddy this korea's got the highest mountains in the shortest minute [Music] so [Music] oh [Music] so oh [Applause] now with somebody

down sarge i could i'll take care of this who's something that nurse she's something can you imagine having her around all the time all those days and nights yeah yes sir this might prove to be a very interesting trip i've heard about them babes with their motel on wheels and this one looks like she's been around pretty good you judge everyone by your standards standards what do you mean standards you don't see no halo around this iron angel do you you bet you don't no sir what other reason would a good-looking babe like that be mixed up in a place like this i've seen a lot of camp followers in my time but that one is an extreme case that is a war follower why don't you save it and and in them hospitals in japan boy i've had those guys tell me them babes come into the ward right in the middle of the night wild oh [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] george said save it let the sarge speak for himself slick sleeve look motor mouth you ain't got nothing with black marks where stripes once was sergeant she's coming too here it'll be okay now just take it easy i'm sergeant walsh we were headed for the 101st field hospital when we saw your ambulance 101st that's right my clothes what happened to my uniform well we we found you ma'am you were nearly drowned so through first thing i thought of was to take your clothes off i mean was the only thing i could think of well what i mean is we just couldn't let you stay in that wet uniform you you might catch your money for sure maybe die oh thanks very much now will you give me my uniform and a little privacy your uniform lieutenant lieutenant second lieutenant laura fleming 101st field hospital 288 medical we we built a kind of a room sort of over there for the lady inside the ambulance still pretty wet this is lieutenant fleming lieutenant yeah she's a nurse in the 101st field hospital all right that's that's fine that's just where we were heading uh there it is oh that just might turn black any more damage you oughta know uh think you might like to have some dinner yes thanks i would he must have got him calling field rations dinner but uh i always say share and share like little fire serge hot soup and coffee yeah okay a small one dinner in five minutes lieutenant would you leave me alone please oh yes ma'am lieutenant [Applause] get back to your coffee before i boil in it what's the matter can i fella have a little fun if you can't touch you can look that coffee's strong enough and i can hoot off an hour attention lieutenant dinner is saved thank you lieutenant if i may ask what are you doing out in this area alone i wasn't alone i had a driver and a patient that i was taking to the hunting first or are they dead dead planes hit us as we were crossing some open country they came in low first one hit my patient and the second one my driver he was dead in an hour i didn't know what to do my training hadn't covered any of this i wrapped them in blankets i marked them and i had their tags it was getting pretty dark and i started driving i tried to make it back to the hospital but i became lost i guess suddenly there was a a bump like i hit something i didn't remember anything else well that's no job for a woman anyway oh that's nothing against you lieutenant i realize that these nurses in the hospitals take temperatures write letters hold their hands and talk to them but a woman's got no business in the combat area it's not right the guide sent you out here ought to have his commission cut off for your information sergeant we don't just write letters and hold hands i'm a surgical nurse trained to operate in combat areas and that's where most of the men are wounded running sergeant [Music] lieutenant is a good 10 miles yet from here at the hospital do you mind if me and my men ride along you're welcome to ride but not your weapons what do you mean not our weapons it's regulations what regulations geneva agreement definitely states obviously that's ridiculous it's stupid it's uh regulations come here lieutenant look do you think the lousy comic pilot to put those hoes in there gives a damn about your regulations this is not a red cross to them it's a bull's-eye lieutenant have you forgotten about the two men you buried from this this iron angel of i'm yours sergeant [Music] hey lieutenant [Music] and we better follow her sergeant that ambulance doesn't have enough gasoline in it to fill your lighter okay round up the man okay sorry all right fellas let's go [Music] right now [Music] so [Music] so [Music] she took the road to the right she's heading away from the hospital well nothing worse than an intelligent woman that doesn't know anything you think she'd carry a compass well she don't need no couples you know all you got to do is look at a tree and if there's no moss you see you know you know what well we'll see you know this i wonder which way that road goes outside well not the gas station that's for sure are you positive that tank was near empty good shot well if there isn't a gas station in those rocks i'd say she's pretty close to walking right now now let's go take this and it's the sun you know comes in from the west when it's going down and it kind of grows and you look at it and uh well it it's kind of scientific if you know it's called the artist's plane if i had a tree here i'd show you this uh from the west side you see [Music] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] now [Music] you sure get a lot of mileage out of an empty tank all in the wrong direction the hospital's back that way at least 15 miles well i'm sorry to have inconvenienced you you needn't have followed well it's just as well you did run out of gas another few miles and you'd been giving first aid to the gooks i said i was sorry all right let's take a break [Applause] ah i ain't no farmer but i bet on this stuff you couldn't raise hell with a pint of whiskey you'd be surprised what a man could raise on this given time and tools we keep sitting around here like ducks on a pond we're going to become part of this real estate you better get off your feet we're going to start walking in 20 minutes hey sarge you know i was thinking we keep walking and we miss that the hospital we're going to walk right into the ocean it's over 80 miles and it's a yellow sea y'all see i think as you know that big mouth of yours is going to get you in trouble one of these days reb i'll have the coffee ready in a minute sarge excuse me lieutenant mind if i join you not at all i was kind of rough on you a minute ago i'd like to apologize no need i wasn't very cooperative or understanding myself i haven't spoken to a woman for so long i i guess i've forgotten how sergeant are you down on all women in uniform or all women well neither one really but you know this is a lousy messy business and i don't think they should complicate it more by putting women in a combat area i'm not a woman not here i'm just a person that has a skill that's needed if there were men available they'd be here but there aren't would you deny the hundreds of boys a chance to live just to keep women out of the field hundreds we got thousand dying lieutenant and even the few that might be saved you deny them that chance just to satisfy your manly ego sergeant do you know the feeling one has in helping to save a life do you no i guess i don't i'm sorry sergeant i i shouldn't be talking to you this way you're really sold on this uh florence nightingale business aren't you i guess i am my father was doctor in little town of michigan first he wanted me to be a boy although he never said so then he wanted me to be a doctor that he said plenty but he had to settle on me being a nurse i'm very happy it's very rewarding it must be i was a good nurse back home i wanted so desperately to be of service out here really of help look i've lost my patient my driver was killed my ambulance wrecked i've endangered your life and the lies of your men i guess i fouled up the detail isn't that what they say well that's not quite what we say lieutenant but then you shouldn't blame yourself too much these things are going to happen no matter how hard we try they just seem to happen you know back home people are being killed every day just crossing the streets here everything is so noisy so compressed so close but then you can't let it bother you are you going ahead with your nursing career when you get back home i don't know much else well i'm in the same boat what did you do before the war oh about the same to do now drive a truck oh truck driver not very glamorous or rewarding is it i didn't mean that well you'd be right it isn't must be interesting though traveling to the country back home that is well i was driving relief out of chicago then i finally got a regular run between chicago and denver before i knew it i was wheeling a six-six behind the red ball express trying to catch up with pat i saw the country all right but not much of it back home hey sword coffee's ready i'll bring it if you like be right there no a tenant with your permission i'd like to use the soft seat and the iron angel while we still got it well no weapons okay well what do you know [Music] sergeant i meant to tell you before i thought i saw something up in the hill could have been my imagination well i don't think them this far down yet that'd be the same old story them on the high ground that's on the low oh boy why don't you drink your coffee i'd like a nice cold beer i'd give a much beer ration for one more night it'll bush [Music] hey do [Music] so [Music] my so [Music] this [Music] so [Music] no barefoot dish you're running up and down your back isn't it i'd like a nice cold beer i hope i never get that thirsty chow time huh our buffet garcon

i can do nothing it's going away leave me alone he loves me now she loves me she loves me hey oh sorry uh we got them all and this one right through the heart see if you can figure out a way to get the gas out of this one into the iron angel you bet sorry no problem no problem at all there you know take care of these no problem at all see canteen no take it easy oh my god no oh yeah this ought to do it what's that well it's a tube off a plasma bottle i found over in the ambulance what happened to our friends here oh how's corporal doing nurse is getting him fixed up best you can yeah boy he's lucky she's here she hadn't been here this never would have happened look she's just trying to do a job with your layoff oh that's the worst gas i ever tasted you talked like an expert yeah i was always too shy to hitchhike what do you think of this little pin-up i found lieutenant collins now what about it i found it in the iron angel but don't you get it that nurse was engaged or something to the lieutenant and she doesn't know he's uh how could she boy that's tough after all she's been through ah she'll get over it they always do we gonna tell her i couldn't well the way i figured sergeant ought to tell her after all he was one hey why don't you just keep your foul mouth closed for a change we all saw it didn't we sergeant yes lieutenant i think he'd be more comfortable on the stretcher would you take care of it please couple you guys grab a litter and give me a hand doc yeah i found this pin up in the ambulance i think it's hers [Applause] i know this has been an awful strain on you but we'll be out of here soon too bad you had to find out this way i'm awfully sorry how when did it happen go on tell us sarge the lieutenant wants to know what happened get off of my back rib ask him lieutenant ask him what collins's last words were so help me i'll kill you why change the pattern sarge sarge come here quick [Applause] look sarge i found their map yeah what about it well this is the road the convoy's on can you see this marker here that's the gun emplacement that we hit yeah that's what i thought so if this kind of marking means a gun emplacement then this one up here is just like it must mean another one one we didn't know about yeah it must be right on the road i'll bet this trail leads up to that gun must be where these guys came from well if this jeep can make it down here the iron angel should be able to make it up there all right never can we make it in time well i don't know the convoy was rolling at 0.700 they figured to be in range of this gun emplacement at 100 at three hours distance from here to here and the road after that is all sorts of cutbacks and a steep grade they'd be lucky to average maybe uh three mile an hour well i don't know it's three hours from this point to this point it's twice the distance from this point to this point or six hours or maybe more that gives us two hours to get there two hours to get that gun well where do you think we are now well we've been traveling parallel to that range we're three or four miles from the river i'd say we're right about here can we make it in time we've got to try how much gas were you able to get in ah this is uh a fourth helmet full sarge that about does it okay put this thing away lieutenant will have to take your ambulance what about the corporal carp we just found out there's another gun emplacement up the road that we didn't know anything about if we don't get her to figure out a way to stop crazy fox he'll turn him to pieces what are we waiting for tough ride think you can make it i'll make it if you make it sergeant good boy all right let's go buttons bring my gear [Music] buttons [Music] hmm [Music] [Music] thank you he's lost a lot of blood will you stay right here and don't move for a clear shot at the band it must be somewhere over that rise yeah but where oh i wish these gooks would put street numbers on their maps now let's go take it easy for the fellas they're looking for the gun [Applause] oh we thought a lot of him too ma'am heard you talking to the serge in the rib i think you ought to know that lieutenant collins was a good man a very good soldier but what the rib said just wasn't true about the sarge i mean sarge did everything he could to help wasn't anybody's fault really it's just the way they get bad luck that's all just bad luck but why would reb say don't try to figure him out ma'am if he wasn't chipping at this heart and he'd be making remarks about me he calls himself rib you know make people think he's from the south so that when he makes digs at me people won't blame him personally you know like it's expected of him kind of spread the blame around well i looked up his record he was born and raised in iowa he didn't mean to hurt you really he's just striking out i sort of feel sorry for myself anybody that full of hate must be awfully miserable see anything i sure don't wish i was sure they didn't see us can you see the sergeant lieutenant i can't see them and got over the ridge like looking for that well-known needle god i hope they find it well once those goose spot that convoy they'll open up then they'll get them it might be too late might be maybe if i go over behind that legend kicked off a few rounds they might open up and show us their position well just knowing where they are won't do us any good and getting ourselves pinned down won't get that gun we got to move in so they won't be able to see us let's move i sure wish i knew what they were doing i can't see them you know lieutenant if you went up to that rock over there you might be able to see them be careful though [Music] so [Music] foreign [Music] what are you doing oh please lieutenant please i can take the iron angel and draw their fire i can make them open up we just got to get that gun oh god listen said the iron angel was a real bull's-eye we can't draw the fire hey sarge you misread that map there's no gun in placement up there there she goes again is that idiot doing what i think she's doing [Music] there's again here [Music] but all right come on come on drake okay sorry oh god even die out here not here [Music] [Applause] charge charge [Applause] my god hold on kid i'll get the nurse tired all right now she he had enough he'll make it tougher i never thought i'd want to talk to a chaplain okay you still got the bible it's a it's in the ambulance i'll go get it wait no maybe i still got one yeah [Music] hi father who art in heaven how would be i can't make a hammer i got the word i i
