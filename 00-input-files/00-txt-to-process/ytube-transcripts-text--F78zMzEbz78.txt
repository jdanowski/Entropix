[Music] god [Music] [Music] north korea perhaps one of the world's most brutal and mysterious regions over the past decades the country has seen extreme famine poverty and a growing list of human rights violations all at the hands of its brutal dictators it's certainly not a place that many would like to live but for its citizens escape has become nearly impossible as its border security has become the most stringent in the world however in april of 2014 a defector by the name of lim ji hwan would manage to escape its boundaries fleeing the country she had claimed to be hell on earth to start her new life in south korea but how could she have known that this would be where her true nightmare would begin before we get too far into this i want to give a huge thank you to today's sponsor blinkist as many of you know by now i love stories and not just telling them but hearing them too but i've never been much of a book reader because i really don't have a lot of time throughout my day and that's where blinkist comes in blinkist takes full length books and essentially highlights their stories into a 15 minute summary which you can then read yourself or have it read to you so when i'm driving or cooking i can literally hear what would equate to a full book in just a matter of minutes recently i just started listening through chernobyl the history of nuclear catastrophe which was actually written by a chernobyl survivor who recounted his experience surviving the disaster but with thousands of titles to choose from there really is something for everyone so make sure you visit blinkist.com nick crowley and the first 100 people to sign up will receive unlimited access to the whole library for one week completely free so make sure to visit that link in the description to sign up today lim ji hwan was born in april of 1990 during a peak of economic free fall in north korea citizens were left to starve living their lives in devastating levels of poverty these conditions made limb's childhood anything but ideal as her and her family would often go days on end without eating but as she would grow older these experiences would prove to be far from the most traumatic that she would face with many of her most mentally taxing moments having come from her time in north korea's military she would enlist at the age of 17 only to discover the disturbing levels of sexism that female soldiers would be subjected to on a daily basis male soldiers would be showered in praise and be given gifts for their loyalty while the women would receive nothing in fact they would typically end up being punished as a result as these gifts that the men would receive would come in the form of the female soldiers the men would be allowed to take their pick of women within the military that they could have for the night to do whatever they pleased with with the women not being able to say no or resist and those who would try would be left beaten and sometimes even killed having been just a teenager at the time the effects of this more than toxic work environment would take a toll on limb's mind as she would begin to realize that she could no longer continue living under such circumstances and she knew she had to escape in mid-april of 2014 lim would attempt to cross the north korean border into china by paying a broker the little life savings that she had managed to collect which back then was a common practice for those attempting to defect but one that didn't always work some wouldn't have enough money to leave and they would be turned back to north korean officials who would then send them to the most brutal labor camps imaginable or if they were lucky they would be given a quick public execution either way it seems that in most cases their lives would likely be over upon their capture but as lim would make her attempt the stars had seemingly aligned as she was able to cross the border safely where days later she would arrive in south korea settling down in the country's capital city of seoul now a free woman her life was far from glamorous in the beginning as she would work as a bartender to make ends meet something she was supposedly quite good at as she was known to have a charming personality and good looks a combination that typically yields success in the field of bartending but though it was a rather quiet start to her new life it was a far cry from the regime she had left behind and her newfound freedom would give her opportunities that she could only have dreamed of years prior with one of which being publicly discussing the atrocities of north korea while living in the north those who would criticize the way of life or the decisions made by officials would be viewed as traitors and enemies of the state leading to incredibly harsh punishments again involving labor and prison camps but with lim now in the south she could openly share her traumatic experiences that she had been through something that she would begin to do almost immediately through the use of social media as she would frequently post to her blogs and other forums on these accounts she would expose to the world how disturbed the military system was there and how the citizens of the country were literally starving to death given the constant propaganda and the lack of access to the region there is many that isn't known about north korea so as lim would share these stories people would follow out of curiosity as to what life was really like over there and quickly she would grow a following to the point where she became a small internet celebrity in seoul but as her following grew one thing would quickly become clear that it wasn't just fans who had taken an interest in her lim social media accounts were booming but as soon as she began receiving this attention she would be thrust into a massive scandal multiple articles would be released exposing lim as a sex worker and a former cam girl claiming that she had taken part in multiple pornography shoots while in china a claim that would cause an instant stir as south korea is ultra-conservative when it comes to sex and it's considered very shameful to do any type of work in that industry and these articles appeared to be far from baseless as they would even include photographs and videos that seemed to show lim fully nude performing these lewd acts almost as quickly as lim would become a star it would all be in jeopardy as fans turned their back to her out of shame but the problem was none of these articles were true instead the images that were shown would feature a mix of photoshop along with other women being used that simply looked like limb and the articles would include information that could only be considered as blatant lies as it was clear that whoever had made them were also behind the photoshopped pictures but that begs the question why well despite making major waves within chinese and south korean news outlets neither of these regions would prove to be responsible for the fake articles and instead they had come directly from north korea the nation is known for its intense propaganda within its borders but in this case they had orchestrated a smear campaign against lim in a completely different country and it's not hard to understand why as she had been openly exposing their many wrong doings and the fake news story would be the perfect way of discrediting her and ruining her public image the incident would prove to affect limbs public perception but many would end up catching on to north korea's deceitful ways and lim would end up continuing to grow her following during the next year but now she was doing so knowing that the evil she had left behind was watching her and that she now had a target on her back after the scandal would start to blow over lim would receive a huge break that came in the form of an appearance on a popular south korean television show the show would give lim a larger platform to share her stories and would prove to be an incredible opportunity for her at the time one appearance would quickly turn to two and then three as lin became a fan favorite nearly instantly to the point that she had become a regular on the show once again using her charm and looks to win people over it had seen that limit found her purpose as her love for life couldn't have been more obvious something she would even mention on her birthday in april of 2017 having just turned 23 lim would take to social media to say this is possibly the happiest birthday of my life thank you to all the fans who love me you give me the courage to keep speaking out lim was on top of the world and her life was at an all-time high but this is something that wouldn't last long as this post would prove to be one of the last that she would ever make in the days following her birthday nim jihuan would inexplicably vanish leaving her once active social media accounts completely silent authorities would visit her home only to find everything left as it was lim had not taken her valuables and her savings of over twenty thousand dollars were left untouched in her bank account with there having been no activity since the last day she was seen wherever lim had gone she had left in a hurry without taking so much as a change of clothes lim would not be heard from for days which would roll over into weeks as speculation grew like wildfire some believe that lim had been the victim of an attack or a kidnapping likely at the hands of someone who had heard the vile news reports about her unaware of the fact that they were actually fake while others believed that somehow someway north korea had managed to take her back as it was already apparent that they were watching her and actively trying to silence her but this all seemed just too far-fetched as seoul was a safe haven for defectors and north korea had no reach in the region making this kidnapping practically impossible to pull off without detection there was no easy answer to how or why she had vanished but as the weeks became months it was safe to assume the worst that was until july of 2017 when the missing celebrity would suddenly reappear out of the blue being shown on a place that many were used to seeing her their screens lim would appear on a television interview that would be posted to youtube letting the world know that she was safe and that there was no need to worry about her only there was something very wrong with the clip as it didn't come from the regular show that people were used to seeing her on in fact in the clip she wasn't even shown in south korea at all or even china for that matter and instead the interview was taking place in north korea in the video lim would explain that she had made the choice to go back to north korea a decision she made as a result of hating her life in south korea she claimed to have been lured into escaping her homeland at the promise of money and food but when she got there she described life as being hell further stating that i wept every day missing my fatherland and my parents also adding that south korea had coerced her into saying all of those negative things about the north she would continue by saying i committed a terrible crime i am worthless i do not deserve to live before begging kim jong-un for forgiveness as well as calling herself human trash it was a shocking twist limit ben seemingly so happy and in her short time in seoul she had managed to amass a good amount of money along with thousands of adoring fans and supporters as well as a good home yet here she was back in north korea telling the world how horrible her time was in south korea the interview was certainly strange as nothing seemed to be adding up about her story and along with this fans would notice that her face appeared to have been swollen her hair was cut short and her eyes looked as if she had been crying the bubbly and cheerful limb had seemingly been reduced to a shell of herself plus the idea of limb returning to the north voluntarily was one that just didn't make any sense as mentioned previously those caught fleeing north korea were subjected to brutal punishments typically equating to a death sentence yet here we have lim who not only escaped but also publicly put the whole country on blast for the whole world to see on numerous occasions and we're supposed to believe that she had just went back on her own and didn't face any punishment in reality returning to north korea was going to be a death sentence for lim and would likely mean years of the worst torture imaginable and this is something that she would have known for certain going in so realistically it is more than unlikely that she would have returned voluntarily and instead it seemed that somehow north korea had managed to take her back but how maybe lim had gone to china in an attempt to smuggle her family members out of the country and was subsequently captured upon doing so where she would have been returned to north korea something that china does quite regularly as the nations are allies or maybe lim had been told that officials in north korea were going to slaughter and torture her family as a result of her fleeing and in order to stop them she would sacrifice her life and return to the nation whatever case was true the only certainty seemed to be that lim's return to the north was forced upon her return lim would be used as a propaganda tool spreading misinformation to citizens about the supposed horrors of living in south korea while also stating that she had not been kidnapped or coerced into returning she'd also claim that she was treated well and that defectors can always safely return home a note that is far from the truth as those returning would almost certainly be killed but just the idea of anyone falling for this and actually returning is honestly terrifying lim would be shown in three separate north korean propaganda videos and her deterioration throughout them is obvious as she looks frail and withered by her final appearance from that moment on she has not been heard from or seen again leading many to believe that she was only kept alive as a means of spreading propaganda and what they did with her from there is anyone's guess how much torture did they put her through how brutal was her death and though we don't know for sure i can only imagine how horrible it really was as the way she had spoke against north korea would have likely left her to face the most extreme punishments imaginable lim's story is one that is heartbreaking but sadly it's not unique in recent years it's been discovered that north korea actually has a secret police force whose sole purpose is kidnapping and returning defectors and in just the month prior to lim's disappearance kim jong-un had actually ordered the group to ramp up their efforts with lim likely having been their first target to this day defectors will vanish without a trace now and then with many never being heard from again making it a constant reminder to those who escaped the clutches of north korea that you are never truly safe nimji hwan's life was filled with both pain and triumph and it's the latter that she should be remembered by the courage that it took to escape her country and then to subsequently share her experiences with the world knowing that it would put a target on her back is unfathomable and whatever it was that happened to her once she returned to north korea i just hoped that it was quick and that she's in a much better place now i want to give a huge thank you to my gold tier patrons and my god tier patrons alfred donovan aaron just daily kaylee kilcrease catherine
