North Korea not the best of places to visit if you're planning a vacation unless you're into capital punishment crazy amounts of carbon dioxide emissions and overly strict military regimes but regardless if you are planning on visiting North Korea you may find more than a few things out of the ordinary failing to take note of these may end up doing you more harm than good so with that being said we're gonna talk about some really messed up laws that you can only find in North Korea but before we start remember to subscribe to the richest give us a like and leave us a comment about what you think of North Korea's laws no Bibles allowed this completely totalitarian government demands that no person should believe in a power higher than that of itself apparently the North Korean government has tried to convince the general public that the Kim family has godlike powers if that doesn't scream god complex we don't know what will according to the law there it is illegal to carry a Bible and anyone found in possession of one can be punished by prison time or worse government regulated hairstyles north Korea has some very specific rules on hairstyles according to North Korean law there are 28 to government approved hairstyles that's ten for men and 18 for women anything other than these 28 hairstyles is considered illegal the weirdest aspect of this law is that Kim Jong Un's iconic haircut isn't on the list he's the only one in the country with that particular hairstyle regulated driving you might want to reconsider asking for a car for your 16th birthday if you're in North Korea North Korean law states that the only people allowed to drive a car in the country are state officials and VIPs if the numbers are to be believed only 10 out of every 1000 people in North Korea own a car the use of public transportation is highly encouraged so unless you plan on getting yourself a government job transportation is going to be a bit of a problem for you living in the capital isn't easy we often look at relocation as a massive inconvenience moving houses is an inevitability and we often overlook the fact that we're free to move to anywhere we want within our countries North Korea doesn't offer its citizens that freedom if a citizen wants to move to Pyongyang they need to get the government's permission first the capital city is reserved for the most successful and loyal citizens both qualities are determined by the government controlled television regardless of how much TV North Koreans watch they don't get a say in what they watch exactly so say goodbye to your weekly Game of Thrones and Doctor Who binging because in North Korea all television content is regulated by the government the authorities offer the citizens a grand total of three channels to choose from all of which are controlled strictly by the state so get the popcorn ready because tonight you're in for a fresh episode of propaganda all for one and one for all if there's one thing that doesn't pay in North Korea it's crime the North Korean government has a lot in place to prevent criminals from escaping prisons which involves punishing the entire family bloodline of the escaped criminal all the way to their grandparents this particular law is heinous enough for the United Nations to have a serious debate on whether or not North Korea was committing crimes against humanity there have even been rumors of starvation and slavery camps in North Korea which is crazy to think about in this day and age no international calls North Korean laws prohibits people from making international phone calls in 2012 a man was shot by the government for making an international call inside the stadium it caused a massive stampede which resulted in the demise of six people what made this event worse was the fact that the government refused to take any blame for the action no opinions freedom of speech is an important right to have one which has been the subject of plenty of debates over the years North Korea firmly believes that freedom of speech is overrated think about all of the laws you've heard about so far do you like them if you do good for you and more power to you but if you don't pack your bags because you're about to take a less than lovely trip to an educational camp there you'll be brainwashed into developing opinions that are more approving of the government and the authorities forbidden from leaving the country if you happen to be of North Korean descent you are forbidden from leaving the country and are forced to live out the duration of your natural-born life there any attempts at leaving the country are considered illegal if any person is found doing so they are hunted down by the government and punished severely it's an unsettling reality that the people of North Korea have to endure this prevents them from leaving the poverty-stricken boundaries of their own country in hopes of making a better life for themselves the three caste system established in 1957 by kim ill sung North Korea's three caste system is a law that divides the citizens of North Korea into three different classes each titled core wavering and hostiles the law classifies people into these three categories based on the political social and economic background of their ancestors and the behavior of the relatives the law named Seong bun determines if a person gets to have access to North Korea's educational and employment opportunities it also determines if the person in question is qualified to have access to adequate food the North Korean government has denied these allegations and stated that all citizens within the country are treated equally Yeah right let us know if you've ever been to North Korea and tell us if you've ever encountered any of these laws if you liked the video remember to click the like button and subscribe to the richest for more interesting videos like this one bye bye
