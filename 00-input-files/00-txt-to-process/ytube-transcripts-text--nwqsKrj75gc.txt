and we turn now to the latest war of words between the united states and north korea pyongyang has hit back at u.s president joe biden after he described its nuclear program as a serious threat to world security north korea accuses the u.s of pursuing a policy of hostility and warns there will be consequences this week north korea has been putting on a show for the 10th congress of the socialist patriotic youth league but while the crowds were dutifully fawning over their leader kim young-furious diplomats were preparing a response to the u.s president in a statement released online they said the us has now insulted the dignity of our supreme leadership this is an evident sign that it is girding itself up for an all-out showdown with the dprk the war of words came in response to joe biden's comments to congress on thursday on iran and north korea nuclear programs that present serious threats to american security and the security of the world we're going to be working closely with our allies to address the threats posed by both of these countries through through diplomacy as well as stern deterrence thank in 2018 donald trump was the first u.s president to meet with a north korean leader their mutual affection brought about a moratorium on long-range missile testing though it failed to bring about peace to make matters worse pyongyang hit out at their southern neighbours after defectors this week used balloons to scatter thousands of leaflets and dollars across the north we've warned south korea of the consequences their silent approval of the defectors will have on north-south relations group is being investigated by police in the south under a controversial new law such leaflet drops are illegal an effort by seoul to appease its erratic neighbor it's always hard to understand what's going on in north korea but fortunately we're joined by aidan foster carter an expert on korea at leeds university in the uk um could you tell us is this latest rebuke from north korea just more posturing or should we be taking this more seriously i think it's mainly posturing i mean here we go another weekend and they fire a triple volley from their multiple squib launcher system as you might call it three statements as your correspondent said i mean but they're two of them are fairly low level one from a foreign ministry spokesman not named one from a department head in the foreign ministry and of course kim kim jong-un's sister kim yo-jong who is snarling at the at the south koreans so they clearly want us to take notice and here we are talking about it and it's all over the wires and the headlines but i think this is posturing i would call it getting your retaliation in first as the phrase goes we know that the biden the new us administration's policy review on north korea which has been trailed a little bit leaked a little bit is coming out quite soon and the north koreans want to remind us as if we doubted it for one moment that they are not a pushover this is not i think their last word to president biden yeah well thanks for bringing that up because of course we've got a new u.s president and the biden administration uh is hardly showing any signs of wanting to go gland hand with with the north korean leader and has promised instead to quote uh pursue a calibrated political approach what do you think they mean by that this is actually interesting so in a way my first reaction was disappointment though i'm used to being disappointed with north korea because although we do have to wait for the full document and they've taken their time over it really so they they clearly the biden administration is clearly trying to do something different and of course it's nobody has solved the north korea question but what do you not do well you don't do like trump go straight in with the summit razzmatazz show business uh but then not really bother about working level talks details so you know besides the showbiz nothing actually happened but equally you don't do what biden's democratic uh predecessor who of course biden served as vice president barack obama did so-called strategic patience which sort of means not doing anything very much they want to so biden wants to engage north korea in a calibrated calculated way um arms control really this used to be a thing we talked about in the days in the cold war for those of us who are older than remember it um but the north koreans are saying we're not playing but i don't think that's their last word their economy is in quite a mess they don't want to be 100 dependent on china which is how they're going to end up being so let's wait and see i hope biden will be patient even if they fire something other than rhetoric which i fear they will in the coming weeks and months uh and then then let's see okay aidan foster carter from leeds university an expert on north korea south uh thank you for that insight thank you you
