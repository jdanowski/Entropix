north korea is a country that's riddled with inefficiencies all in the name of making the country appear like a prosperous and powerful nation and it's the people that this duty falls on from stone polishers to puddle sweepers let's take a look at some of the useless jobs that actually exist in north korea before we dive into this sack of incredibly corrupt cats let's find out a bit more about why north korea is so determined to appear powerful to the rest of the world the democratic people's republic of korea more commonly known as north korea couldn't be further from a real democracy if it tried a communist dictatorship at heart the party's ideologies of communism have wreaked havoc on its people for decades collectivized farms have often led to economically mismanaged food shortages and corruption is rife within the country's elite so while the poor starve on meager rations the supreme leader has reportedly suffered ankle fractures because he's gotten too fat off imported cheese to maintain control and ensure the country keeps working the government designates its citizens jobs at the age of 16 which are lifelong careers no promotions no pay raises and with no retirement age you literally work until you die but some of these jobs are designed purely to make the country look better on the outside despite the enormous cracks clearly showing to the rest of the world so if you're not in the 8.9 million strong military which make up about a third of the total population what are some of the most useless jobs you can be forced to do for the rest of your life street sweepers with an average per capita income of just a thousand dollars a year most north koreans are extremely poor this makes things like cars motorcycles even bicycles incredibly hard to come by so the streets of the capital city pyongyang are eerily silent despite having been built so large and wide as a display of prosperity and power with the streets built to accommodate a lot more traffic than there is they're usually quiet and clean but what if your lifelong job was to be a designated street cleaner do you just continue to clean the already spotless roads regardless well yeah secret footage taken in 2010 shows that without anything better to do cleanup squads were attempting to brush away the puddles from the sides of the road in pyongyang since when were puddles considered unsightly that is unless north korea doesn't want us to think it relies on anything not even rain political oppositions did you know north korea holds legitimate elections every five years no joke every half decade the citizens of the hermit kingdom are given the opportunity to vote back in their current party the workers party of korea or vote against them except it's mandatory and while voting for the current ruling party is done by a secret ballot voting against them is done in a separate ballot box without secrecy your name and information are forfeit for voting against the party of the respected comrade who is identical to supreme commander kim jong-il that's a genuine title kim jong-un holds previous parties that have run against the democratic people's republic of korea include the korea buddhist federation the democratic independent party the laboring people's party and the gone men people's party to clarify none of them seem to have won any seats in the last 48 years almost every election under the democratic people's republic of korea is reported to have a turnout rate of 99 or higher with an approval rating for the party of a hundred percent it's almost as if these political parties are left running for show to demonstrate just how tight the wpk's political grip currently is so in theory you could try to run against the current leader kim jong-un just depends on how much you value your life stone cleaner north korea gets an average of around four thousand to six thousand western tourists a year less than point zero two percent of london's tourist football in 2018 and point zero zero seven percent in contrast to new york with so few people visiting how do you make important places of culture look like they're popular well if you're part of north korea's victorious war museum it appears you have a dedicated stone cleaner for more secret footage in 2010 reporters found a poor lady scrubbing pathway stones in the museum courtyard it seems it's considered unsadly to have dirt built up on stones indicating no one has visited for a while she was quickly escorted away from the tourists crying eyes north korea's front of perfection can't be ruined by the idea that most of its country is unbelievably poor so poor that cleaning rocks for a living is a government mandated job snow path clearer and the northernmost areas of north korea lies chongqing the place where kim jong-il oh sorry the eternal general secretary of the party was born i promise i'm not making these up it's a place designed to be celebrated with large murals honoring the dead deer leader but is usually off limits and not just to tourists but the locals alike seeing as the snow is so dense and dangerous and vehicles are rarely equipped to deal with the conditions but even here large monuments and paths are kept clear at all times of the year not by gritters or snow plows but by hand the job of snow clears once again falls to the poor who continue to work in the harsh weather even when there are no visitors shoveling your driveway doesn't seem so bad now does it traffic conductor in most societies beautiful women have the world at their feet they can be actresses ceos models entrepreneurs but in north korea they get to be traffic ladies these weirdly iconic women have to meet three main requirements they must be single beautiful and tall there are about 300 of them in total and they are designed to be a front for pyongyang to maintain the idea of a perfect looking society there are even rumors that these beauties are handpicked for their job by the dear leader himself but remember how before we saw that there aren't huge amounts of traffic around well these women are instructed to carry on regardless it's like the macarena gone mad in the middle of the road on top of this once they reach the age of 26 or are married they're relieved of duty it's a declining profession as they're losing out to the introduction of traffic lights you know like the rest of the world better 90 years late than never i guess fashion police the fashion police are real and they live in north korea in a country where it's a priority to quash all foreign influences fashion comes in high on the list the kim il-sungist and kim jong-ilis youth league make it their duty to ensure that their fellow comrades are maintaining ideological purity and play a role in making sure the youth of north korea are kept from rebelling or opposing their glorious general who descended from heaven yep that one's real too so how do they do this they critique street fashion deviating from dark suits and flat shoes or anything too decorative or unusual could be considered foreign influence and can be punished by a stint in a labor camp but here's a thought if your entire regime can be broken by a miniskirt maybe you need a new regime religious figureheads in north korea's constitution it promises a right to faith but officially north korea is an atheist state defectors claim that the promise of this right is mainly for show with persecution and severe punishments for practicing religions such as christianity outside of state-controlled churches anything that would divert the people's full attention respect and worship from the party or its highest incarnation of the revolutionary comradeship can be judged as a religious coup d'etat if that's the case how would you get by being a priest or any kind of religious figurehead for that matter well usually you don't in pyongyang there are grand total of four churches christian protestant catholic and russian orthodox in a city of similar size such as lisbon there are over 19 churches or take geneva with 18 churches with everyone indoctrinated since birth to treat the kim family is near godlike figures what use is there for religion musician in 2015 outstanding leader of the party army and people kim jong-un seriously what's wrong with president ordered a ban on music house-to-house searches were put into place not just in search of foreign champs but local tunes as well cds and cassettes were incinerated if found to contain newly laud prohibited material why concern arose within the party that certain lyrics could motivate dissent musicians and their music must be given state authorization to be distributed to the masses making musicians almost irrelevant within the country's confines but it's not as if they were being paid royalties anyway to date around 15 civilian bans are authorized by the state but there's no guarantee they won't be censored in the future mosaic board holder most of the world has become enamored with augmented reality features at their sporting events south korea in particular have used this stunning technology in pyeongchang's olympic opening ceremony to show a map of constellations as well as bringing dragons into their baseball games but just a stone's throw away in north korea well it's a little more of a hands-on experience literally at the arirang mass games you can see a wide range of human sports and acrobatics performed but take another look at that impressive mosaic at the back it's not a giant screen those are people human pixels if you will acting each as one piece of an ever-changing puzzle the 10 000 citizens here aren't doing this for a paycheck it's an example of volunteers showing commitment to their party and hoping to grace the state's good books why bother with the jumbotron i'm never complaining about my job again if you were given the choice which of these jobs would you prefer to spend the rest of your life doing or do you know any other useless jobs in the hermit kingdom i missed out on i know i'd make a great traffic conductor but i doubt the supreme leader would consider me voluptuous enough so let me know your thoughts in the comments below and thanks for watching
