[Music] in 1991 five boys from daegu south korea mysteriously vanished without a trace over a decade later their bodies were found in an area that had already been surged a missing person's case turned into an unsolved murder investigation with over 500 false leads in a span of over 10 years even with modern advances in forensics the truth about what happened to those boys that day has never been figured out so what do we know for sure today we look at the unsolved mystery of the frog boys march 26 1991 was a public holiday in south korea that tuesday was an election day the first democratic election in 30 years everyone was preoccupied with how the election would go other news was pushed to the side it was on this spring day that five boys went out to play taking advantage of the warming weather and the day off from school while it wasn't certain where the five of them were going they were off for an adventure one that would unfortunately turn out to be their last ruchiel won joho yon and kim yong-sek were all described as closer than brothers by wu jong-u julwan's father the five of their families lived in a village just outside daegu city the boys were all neighbors and their houses were arranged in a circle they lived so close to each other that they could just walk out of their front doors and immediately hang out something which they often did according to wu jong-u they were like the five musketeers chongu only realized that his child was missing when he received a phone call from his son's taekwondo academy wu chilwan hadn't shown up that day after the phone call chong-hoo walked around the neighborhood asking the other parents if their boys hadn't shown up to the academy as well it was soon obvious that his son was not the only one missing during his search a friend of the boys told jong-u that the five children were on their way to collect salamander eggs other news reports said that the boys were on their way to catch frogs as such the missing friends became known as the frog boys if the boys were indeed on their way to catch frogs then there was only one place they could be mount wariom a mountain range behind song san high school all of the parents went to mount maryong to search for their children and remain there well into the evening hours even so they found no trace of their sons the parents quickly filed a report with the police the police however regarded the boys as nothing more than runaways the parents were simply told to wait it out and see if their children would come home maybe they were out playing and lost track of time hanging out later than expected at this point there was no case to investigate at least not in the minds of the authorities two days later word had begun to spread around daegu the boys still hadn't come home after a week the case had become nationwide news were the frog boys simply missing were they still alive those were the questions on everyone's lips three days after the initial disappearance the kim family received a phone call from an unknown man this mystery caller claimed to have the boys saying i have the children they are all suffering two are very ill mr kim went to an area nedegu station along with the other parents and the police the anonymous caller had asked for a ransom in return for the children and told them all to meet him there the group waited for an hour but no one showed up not the perp not the missing frog boys no one only the distraught parents and their hopelessness remained on that street the phone call later turned out to be a prank the police continued to regard the frog boys as an open and shot runaway case naju bong the chairman of the national organization of missing children said that the police didn't really actively investigate the case this holds true as we'll see but at the very least the police did take more of an interest in the case after the media became involved the boy's parents all took part in a television program called the square of public opinions they made their frustration with the police's involvement or lack of involvement known park gancio park chan in's father made it clear that he believed the police were trying to close the case as quickly as possible and avoiding a proper investigation on the tv show he held up a flyer and pointed out that the wording had been changed when it was going to be released by the police the boys have been missing from the start said gancio but somehow the pamphlets printed by the authorities say run away this indicates that the police are trying to wrap up the case as quickly as possible by treating it as a simple runaway we want to change this during the program a phone call came in live on air hudo-san young six mother confirmed that it was her son's voice on the other end of the line jung sik was alive the excitement of the parents and the public was short-lived however this call turned out to be another sick prank the show of frustration on live tv had the desired effect of driving the police to become more active in the case after the square of public opinions aired roh taiwu the president of south korea at the time ordered an official search of mount warion over 300 000 policemen and volunteers took to scouring the mountain officials created a special unit dedicated to finding the frog voice a reward of 42 million won around 35 000 dollars u.s was offered for the boy's safe return donated by various schools and civic groups who had taken an interest in the case mount warrior was now a scene of loss fear and anxiety rather than the place of peaceful natural beauty it had been once before droves of volunteers climbed in lines up the mountain beating down the tall grass as they went their search efforts lasted for over a year all the while they held onto hope that the five boys would be found sadly for the devastated parents these searches yielded no clues as to what happened to their sons the novelty of the search wore off after a few years life went back to normal for the rest of the nation but the frog boys families were left with no answers rather than giving up the fathers of the missing boys made searching for their sons their full-time duty they quit their jobs to look for their boys passed out pamphlets to the public and even rented a truck which they drove around the entire country the sides of the truck were covered in pictures of the frog boys with the words please help find our missing lads printed underneath they hoped that this might inspire someone to come forward with some type of evidence rain snow warshine the fathers persisted their search was aided by the aforementioned najibong na had decided not to abandon the surge after seeing the physical and mental toll that the case was taking on the families in an article by cna insider na noted that yonggu's father looked pale and his face was turning blue he was hooked on sleeping tablets we realized that even this strong man was losing his health after a while seeing the fathers become weaker like that i couldn't turn my back on them during a few media events to keep attention drawn to the case na noticed some strange men are present in the audience well-dressed suspicious looking men who always stood or sat at the back one day he spoke to one of them this mysterious individual gave na his business card the card had no information on it other than a name and phone number no place of work no business address no clues na later discovered that the man that he had spoken with was from an intelligence agency the desperate fathers were being followed around the nation by people who claimed to be protecting them but nah believed otherwise instead of being treated with respect and privacy the families were being counted by intelligence agents who followed their every move they knew the schedules of every individual family member in each of the five households agents were even sent to the family's homes they were being far too hands-on something wasn't right about this as public interest in the case faded even more the search efforts slowed eventually newspapers refused to publish anything related to the frog boys the story had become old news of little interest to anyone anyone besides the boy's families of course kim hyeondo yonggu's father recalled how they were all thrown out of newspaper offices in seoul while attempting to have the papers published pieces about the boys three years after taking on the search the fathers knew they needed to go back to work there were other duties at home other family members who needed to be cared for debts to be paid life needed to go on with heavy hearts they ceased their surge two years passed a psychologist from the united states named kim garwon had caught wind of the frogboy's case and came forward claiming to have studied it in depth this turned out to be more of a red herring than anything else the psychologist claimed that the boy's bodies were buried in kimchil gyu's home the father of young sick what was his reasoning for that assertion apparently kim was unable to give a decent alibi for where he was for the first three hours his son was missing the other parents were skeptical still kim's home was dug up while the media filmed leading to more suffering stress and humiliation and nothing to show for the suspicion the psychologist's assertion was complete bull on september 26 2002 hikers were out searching for acorns on mount wariong but choi juan thai found much more than acorns on the mountainside that day in amongst the foliage he discovered shoes and clothing shoes and clothing that were suspiciously childlike soon he found bones the authorities were called this led to the eventual discovery of five sets of remains presumed to be those of the frog boys because the remains were so deteriorated when they were found it was difficult for forensic experts to determine the cause of death or even to confirm that the bodies belong to the frog boys at all despite that family members confirmed that the bodies were their missing sons clothing five pairs of shoes and braces that belong to joe ho young helped them determine that strangely one of the boy's clothes were discovered with the sleaze of his sweater knotted together in a way that would have been impossible for him to do by himself his trousers and shoes were also found flipped over his shoulders equally estranged an empty bullet casing along with three unused bullets were found in young hugh's clothing upon the discovery of the remains police called them forensic specialists xi jong-min a forensic specialist on the scene recalled that for about two to three hours the police were making many mistakes and handling the bodies for example they didn't block off the area where the boys were found the amount of evidence the forensic team were able to use shrank as the police group bones together in a nonsensical way and placed them on newspapers to shield them from the ground in the end the only evidence the forensic team were able to use was their own given the state of the evidence the police had handled this also made finding the cause of death difficult initially police suggested that the lads had simply died from a combination of exhaustion and hypothermia the night of their disappearance had been called them wet after all it could only make sense that they became lost and huddled together for warmth right forensic specialists and family members both disputed this notion mount warion is only about two kilometers away from daegu making it unlikely that the boys would be stuck in harsh weather the korea alpine federation experts in working in mountainous terrain and dense forests also came in to help on the case choi wan seok the director of this rescue team noted that he was certain this was a murder case even if the police were convinced otherwise he said that area isn't high up at all it isn't even 100 meters from the streets if it was cold and raining it would have taken only five minutes for the boys to run home the frog boys were close enough to civilization that they could have seen and heard the city they were familiar enough with the area that they could have been home quickly if they needed to be kim jai q kim yun's six uncle stated the boys used to visit and play around this mountain and knew the direction very well it doesn't make sense that they got lost there the boy's remains were found huddled together and after examination forensics found evidence of trauma one of the boys was found with holes in both sides of his skull there were marks on the skulls of three of the other boys which quote unquote appear to be created by blows with metal objects possibly a tool of some kind that's according to a report by kyungpuk national university's forensic medicine team later analysis of the soil where the remains were found showed that the five boys died in that location even so the parents still believe that the boys were murdered somewhere else and the bodies moved to that spot where they were eventually discovered at a later point why wouldn't the bodies have been found during the past decade of searching if they'd been there the whole time mount warion had been scoured thoroughly police also discovered a five centimeter long shell and two one centimeter long empty shells near where the boys were discovered but claimed that there were no links between the two they explained this finding a way by pointing out that there was a military range in the area about 300 meters away the base's shooting range was operating at the time but isn't in use today maybe the shelves were fired off during some military exercise the boy's parents weren't convinced back when the frog boys went missing a friend of chul1 mentioned that he had heard a gunshot followed by a scream the day the voice disappeared when he was asked by the parents if he'd been telling the truth all those years ago he confirmed that he had there was no further investigation into his claim the rumor mill's been working overtime on this case there's plenty of speculation even conspiracy regarding what happened to the frog boys one theory both the people involved in the case and the south korean public seem to be behind the most is that the military might be behind the boy's deaths after all as the police pointed out there was a military shooting range on mount varian not far from where the boys were discovered park gancio also suspects that the military had something to do with his son's demise he pointed out that while a regular soldier would have had the day off due to the holiday a commissioned officer would have been able to go to the practice range alone if he'd wanted to troy once york also mentioned that the day the boys went missing there were reports that the shooting range had been used by a soldier to empty the remaining ammo from his gun to this day no one knows that soldier's identity najubong speculated that the military were involved in the boys disappearances and slayings believing quote unquote they are hiding something an accidental shooting military or otherwise seems unlikely though one boy was found with holes in both sides of his skull but the hulls were missing the telltale signs of a ballistic injury bone fractures the others showed head injuries that look like they've been hit by a large object not a bullet that doesn't make sense if this was an accidental shooting that doesn't make sense if this was an accident of any kind on top of that why were the boys found with their clothes tied in knots the police never brought the military into question although rumors regarding army involvement continued there was no further investigation into the matter korea's zhong ang daily wrote about one theory saying the boys were kidnapped by a mentally ill individual but there isn't much to support that idea xiao yong min presented his theory that a psychopath was behind the boy's disappearances this theory was circulating around the public at the time if this were a random psychopathic killing however surely there would have been other similar incidents in south korea both back then and more recently to this day there haven't been kanji won a lawyer who eventually filed a lawsuit against the police overseeing the case believes that there's quote unquote a huge conspiracy around this mystery kim hudo thinks that one of the frog boys was accidentally shot and that the others were selene as a cover-up with so many unanswered questions and no official suspects the case of the frog boys is both frustrating and heartbreaking after over a decade of supposedly assessing and reassessing what little evidence they had the police finally threw in the towel they claimed that they could find nothing else beyond the bones and what clothes and shoes they were able to salvage on the mountain the south korean military denied any involvement in the boy's deaths at the time the statute of limitations on the case was also nearing its expiration date meaning that if any suspects were found and they couldn't be prosecuted the five boys were finally laid to rest on march 26 2004 their parents carried their ashes to the nakdong river scattering them across the water to flow into the pacific in a heart-rending statement park gancio said they died together so we wanted them to play together in the afterlife as mentioned kang ji won eventually filed three lawsuits against the police who oversaw the case feeling that the parents deserve to be compensated by the government for their suffering especially when the police tampered with evidence that could have led to a conclusive cause of death all three lawsuits failed and the investigations were closed one light in the darkness of this case is that south korea abandoned the law regarding the statute of limitations in 2015. if new evidence is found the frogboy's case could potentially be reopened this also gives other families the hope of having their cases reviewed again as well young sex father died at age 40 of liver cancer woo jong-u speculates that he was tired from the stress of losing his child and all of the media interference while the surviving parents lost the lawsuit filed against the authorities and have not received any compensation for their loss no amount of money could heal their wounds even today they still hold hope of finding the truth about what happened to their sons the mystery of the frog boys is incredibly tragic between police mismanagement of the case the political environment at the time the lack of evidence and the lack of suspects there are few if any answers regardless of the messy handling of the evidence and politics at the end of the day this case revolves around five children whose lives are ended far too early and five families whose lives have been altered forever but what do you think were the frog boys simply unable to find their way home in bad weather was the military involved in the cover-up should the government have done more to aid in the search along with the police let me know your thoughts in the comment section [Music] hey guys lazy here and thank you very much for listening just before the video ends i'd like to say a huge thank you to rose corvin for
