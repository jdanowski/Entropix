it's tense on the Korean Peninsula he said you're ready to fight tonight yes always fight tonight fight together quite strong everyday 24/7 words radical North Korean leader Kim jong-un and president Trump are exchanging heated threats on the South Korean and US soldiers telling us not to film now the South Korean government is installing one of the u.s. military's most advanced missile defense systems called bad in a remote village despite ongoing I [Music] wouldn't be here yet you know I to negate it yeah it's you gotta move I am young laude white or wrong you know I don't think it is it's one of the three types and look up as we have this is our attack helicopter yeah aged 64 Apache got a large capability of attack platforms here in the combat aviation brigade you know this is one of our primary instruments if we had to fight tonight we visited the US Army's new base in South Korea just days after President Trump made this notorious threat to North Korea they will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen at 3,400 acres camp humphreys as one of the u.s. military's largest overseas construction projects ever located strategically out of range of North Korea's rocket integers it's also home to the Eighth Army which has gotten a lot of attention since North Korea recently tested two intercontinental ballistic missiles that may be able to reach the US you guys say you're ready to fight tonight what does that look like so it means we have every leader every soldier every aviator in this brigade that's ready to jump on the right piece of equipment whether that's a truck or a helicopter and go execute their required mission at a moment's notice over in the United States right now people are really paying attention to North Korea and they're very freaked out about the possibility of a nuclear war breaking out is that sort of heightened panic something that you guys are experiencing here as well so we obviously are attuned to some of the attention but for us it's it's business as usual if the president requires us to fight tonight and he makes the call then he can trust it that his soldiers here in Korea are ready to support us and support this important alliance that they've worked hard South Korea becomes a battleground as communists from the north invade the southern Republic at a dozen points the US has had a permanent military presence in South Korea since it helped the country fight the Korean War in 1950 the war ended in armistice three years later but there was never a peace treaty so the countries are still technically at war today there are 28 thousand US troops in South Korea the third largest US military presence overseas after Japan and Germany Camp Humphreys was recently relocated from an older base in the middle of Seoul just 40 miles from the border with North Korea North Korea's government criticized the move saying it shows that US has intention to permanently occupy the Korean Peninsula I know you guys do regular military exercises with the South Korean military which North Korea calls a provocation and a rehearsal to invade what's your perspective on that what do you call these during exercises I call them improving readiness exercises and really when you're part of an alliance you have a joint responsibility to collectively build your readiness on both sides in an off-camera briefing a high-ranking Army official told us that should North Korea use chemical or nuclear weapons the army knows where they're stored and is prepared to invade the country in order to neutralize them at the same time the North Korean government maintains they need nukes to deter the threat of invasion and an overthrow of Kim Jong moon just 50 miles from the border with North Korea sits Osan Air Base where soldiers of the 35th air defense Artillery Brigade routinely prepare Patriot missiles to be fired in the event of an attack so this is our pack 3 missile system where does it shoots the missile and guides that missile to their TV on so it's literally just hit to kill Connecticut to kill that's what this is the long-term yes the missiles are fired off from the thing we're looking at right now so literally I mean the easiest way to put it out is our launcher and our missiles hit their missiles to bless it all this but this is not been when the cream is left no not yet no yeah I mean depending on we're ready to do it we need to so when President Trump says that everything is locked and loaded as you did just a short while ago is this what he's talking about I guess so we're always ready you know we're ready to fight tonight whether the president United States says that we're locked and loaded we're our postures we're ready to fight tonight at any one given time they're ready to go I know the goal of the US Army here is to maintain the Armistice do you feel like the recent heated rhetoric between President Trump and Kim Jungman has made that job a little harder I can't come on the same day we visited the US bases crowds gathered in Seoul to commemorate independence from Japan and to urge peace with North Korea in his Liberation Day speech president moon jae-in said military action can only be decided by South Korea and not anyone else at the same time moon has moved forward with installing the u.s. built pad or terminal high altitude area defense anti-ballistic missile system in so summary a quiet agricultural village that's now a symbol of resistance anti-war activists believe the fad make South Korea more vulnerable to attack thousands have flocked here to support the roughly one hundred elderly villagers who say their peaceful lives have been disrupted by the military presence [Music] so we're hiking up the mountain right now and it's gonna take us about an hour to get to the top this isn't a mountain that people normally climb this isn't a path it's actually really strenuous but the leader of the village created this path to take news crews up to the top to see the thaad and he marked it with these blue ribbons that you could see over here which are protesting the bad it's from the top of the mountain where you can see the fat which was installed on a former golf course in the village the area is also home to a cemetery and a site sacred to Wan Buddhism but access to both is now restricted the area has been deemed a military zone the fad works by detecting an incoming missile and firing an interceptor missile to destroy it its radar can identify missiles hundreds of miles in range but it's not physically designed to hit fast-moving intercontinental ballistic missiles like the ones North Korea launched in July its developer Lockheed Martin says the THAAD radar could at least provide early tracking data of long-range missiles like those headed toward the u.s. those are Korean soldiers that's the Korean army up there guarding this spot no film for the Korean soldiers telling us this not we definitely weren't expecting that it was pretty surprising and obviously really upsetting to our guide to get to the top of the mountain which he's done many times and then find the Korean military they're telling him you can't go anymore he was saying he doesn't think they have any legal basis for that so not only are these guys actively protesting the presence of the US military here now the Korean military which works with America isn't even letting him get to the top of the mountain of their village so we're gonna find another way Oh yogi pony car chicken community chili McCoy say Oh yogi Tonto Bharati peewee Donna Botti military announcement again persnickety [Music] alright that was that was a second military announcement we heard from the South Korean army telling us to get out of here so we don't want to get in any trouble we're gonna do that and are you okay not okay siga yogi consultant on TV tomorrow other theories Domino's has video for now larita yogi oh no gotta come to Delta Bravo yogi look at them soon quality [ __ ] some South Koreans have been protesting the fad for over a year [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] what just happened why are you laughing right now are they uncle Gus okay Betsy hollowness assuming total nerve and abundant they commonly repair go to monger that's an IR we are a proton pump about me tonight ago so much me name is iris hi panel her for dinner of the fungal City Gail Thomas cometa energy misery Akira is it all started back off threatened in the back many of so summaries villagers are farmers of Cham way or Korean melon they remember the horrors of the Korean War and thought living in a rural area which shield them from further conflict but now the tail end of their lives is spent consumed by fear and worry Jenna mom demand I work week even better thanking help me woman Otto Bayer there because I know losing my man yeah many of the villagers have become activists in their eighties you know you happy now have only open I was just with the US Army and they told me that their presence in South Korea makes this country safer what do you say to them we would enjoy move on we do not a lot of Adam that is a liberal Rob I added under she baked them she well yeah among her other did it is the entrance to her village is now a protest zone with constant police presence as North Korea continues to fire off missile tests and the u.s. and South Korea flex their military might it's the people who are once again caught in the crossfire hey guys it's Dina thanks for watching that video you got a glimpse of what the
